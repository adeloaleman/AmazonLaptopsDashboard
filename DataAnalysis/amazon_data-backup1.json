muy rapida ensciende en menos de 10 segundos con puntos que resaltan como los siguientes El teclado es muy comodo para escribir El touch de la pantalla lo uso con frecuencia pero supongo que habra momentos que pueda ser util pero funciona muy bien Lo peque\u00f1a ligera que es la computadora es excelente muy practica para llevar de un lugar otro La pantalla con los bordes tan delgados encanta El sonido sorprendio mucho es para hacer una fiesta pero si es un sonido muy bueno comparado con las mayorias de computadoras portatiles hablo por la calidad del sonido mas que por el volumen La calidad de la pantalla es muy buena sin lugar duda uno de los puntos mas fuertes Las cosas que quiza podrian mejorar El trackpad es un poco peque\u00f1o de alto un poco incomodo veces pero si usas mouse tendras problemas Para que fuera perfecta seria genial tener una memmoria de video de 4 gigas ya que la de 2 gigas se queda corta con muchos juegos aunque hay algunos que corren de manera descente Se que esta dise\u00f1ada para jugar pero nunca esta de mas saber que lo puedes hacer Tiene los puertos necesarios aunque un puerto hdmi nunca esta de mas aunque se que lo pusieron para mantener la delgadez del aparato En conclusion de momento esta encantando solo espero que windows sea tan estable como el sistema operativo de apple pero eso ya es problema del aparato Seguro

mechanical failure send repair disapponted Excelente computadora tenia 8 a\u00f1os de usar windows unicamnete tenia dispositos Mac quise darme un respiro de apple comprando esta computadora despues de unos dias de uso parece una computadora muy buena muy rapida ensciende en menos de 10 segundos con puntos que resaltan como los siguientes El teclado es muy comodo para escribir El touch de la pantalla lo uso con frecuencia pero supongo que habra momentos que pueda ser util pero funciona muy bien Lo peque\u00f1a ligera que es la computadora es excelente muy practica para llevar de un lugar otro La pantalla con los bordes tan delgados encanta El sonido sorprendio mucho es para hacer una fiesta pero si es un sonido muy bueno comparado con las mayorias de computadoras portatiles hablo por la calidad del sonido mas que por el volumen La calidad de la pantalla es muy buena sin lugar duda uno de los puntos mas fuertes Las cosas que quiza podrian mejorar El trackpad es un poco peque\u00f1o de alto un poco incomodo veces pero si usas mouse tendras problemas Para que fuera perfecta seria genial tener una memmoria de video de 4 gigas ya que la de 2 gigas se queda corta con muchos juegos aunque hay algunos que corren de manera descente Se que esta dise\u00f1ada para jugar pero nunca esta de mas saber que lo puedes hacer Tiene los puertos necesarios aunque un puerto hdmi nunca esta de mas aunque se que lo pusieron para mantener la delgadez del aparato En conclusion de momento esta encantando solo espero que windows sea tan estable como el sistema operativo de apple pero eso ya es problema del aparato Seguro recomiendo la compra de esta computadora Amazing except battery life excited receive replace older Latitude 7280 received reformatted drive clean install Windows 10 Pro

unas grandiosas caracter\u00edsticas Un procesador de \u00faltima generaci\u00f3n i7 9na generaci\u00f3n una excelente tarjeta de video nivel de rendimiento nvidia 1660ti La verdad es que al parecer este computador tiene serios problemas de manufacturaci\u00f3n Invert\u00ed bastante en un notebook que fallo al segundo d\u00eda de uso corr\u00ed el riesgo ignorando los comentarios negativos esperando que solo sea un caso aislado hasta que lleg\u00f3 mi maquina fu\u00ed una v\u00edctima m\u00e1s de la mala manufactura del producto Env\u00ede el notebook al servicio internacional de en mi pa\u00eds el resultado es una falla necesidad de reemplazo en la placa madre pesar de que est\u00e1 en proceso de arreglo se cual ser\u00e1 el resultado de esta historia si finalmente mi computador lograr\u00e1 estar como uno nuevo sera un arreglo que este la altura de la maquina que compre Todo esto mientras corre el tiempo de devoluci\u00f3n de mi dinero si quedo conforme se si lo arreglar\u00e1n tiempo Ped\u00ed el notebook un 5 de diciembre en un env\u00edo que pague para que llegara m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido tardo casi un mes en llegar luego falla al segundo d\u00eda de uso llevo m\u00e1s de 2 semanas esperando la reparaci\u00f3n han hecho pasar un gran estr\u00e9s sabiendo lo que pasar\u00e1 con una inversi\u00f3n grande para m\u00ed 1400 dolares el valor junto con impuestos env\u00edo yo solo quer\u00eda una maquina buena Realmente lamentable la experiencia que recibo tanto de Amazon como de con un producto nuevo que debiese estar en perfectas condiciones sobre todo si es tu primera compra en el sitio Enviarlo de vuelta solo devuelven 20 d\u00f3lares del costo de casi 200 d\u00f3lares que cuesta volver mi producto fallado Espero que esta historia de terror pronto se
