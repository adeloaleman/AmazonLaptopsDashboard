respiro de apple comprando esta computadora despues de unos dias de uso parece una computadora muy buena muy rapida ensciende en menos de 10 segundos con puntos que resaltan como los siguientes El teclado es muy comodo para escribir El touch de la pantalla lo uso con frecuencia pero supongo que habra momentos que pueda ser util pero funciona muy bien Lo peque\u00f1a ligera que es la computadora es excelente muy practica para llevar de un lugar otro La pantalla con los bordes tan delgados encanta El sonido sorprendio mucho es para hacer una fiesta pero si es un sonido muy bueno comparado con las mayorias de computadoras portatiles hablo por la calidad del sonido mas que por el volumen La calidad de la pantalla es muy buena sin lugar duda uno de los puntos mas fuertes Las cosas que quiza podrian mejorar El trackpad es un poco peque\u00f1o de alto un poco incomodo veces pero si usas mouse tendras problemas Para que fuera perfecta seria genial tener una memmoria de video de 4 gigas ya que la de 2 gigas se queda corta con muchos juegos aunque hay algunos que corren de manera descente Se que esta dise\u00f1ada para jugar pero nunca esta de mas saber que lo puedes hacer Tiene los puertos necesarios aunque un puerto hdmi nunca esta de mas aunque se que lo pusieron para mantener la delgadez del aparato En conclusion de momento esta encantando solo espero que windows sea tan estable como el sistema operativo de apple pero eso ya es problema del aparato Seguro recomiendo la compra de esta computadora","2434":"excited receive replace older Latitude 7280 received reformatted

de uso parece una computadora muy buena muy rapida ensciende en menos de 10 segundos con puntos que resaltan como los siguientes El teclado es muy comodo para escribir El touch de la pantalla lo uso con frecuencia pero supongo que habra momentos que pueda ser util pero funciona muy bien Lo peque\u00f1a ligera que es la computadora es excelente muy practica para llevar de un lugar otro La pantalla con los bordes tan delgados encanta El sonido sorprendio mucho es para hacer una fiesta pero si es un sonido muy bueno comparado con las mayorias de computadoras portatiles hablo por la calidad del sonido mas que por el volumen La calidad de la pantalla es muy buena sin lugar duda uno de los puntos mas fuertes Las cosas que quiza podrian mejorar El trackpad es un poco peque\u00f1o de alto un poco incomodo veces pero si usas mouse tendras problemas Para que fuera perfecta seria genial tener una memmoria de video de 4 gigas ya que la de 2 gigas se queda corta con muchos juegos aunque hay algunos que corren de manera descente Se que esta dise\u00f1ada para jugar pero nunca esta de mas saber que lo puedes hacer Tiene los puertos necesarios aunque un puerto hdmi nunca esta de mas aunque se que lo pusieron para mantener la delgadez del aparato En conclusion de momento esta encantando solo espero que windows sea tan estable como el sistema operativo de apple pero eso ya es problema del
