To be honest with you, that does not really pertain to me.  I have a basic understanding of what to expect with certain specs, that, like most people, slightly different computer's descriptions are indistinguishable to me.  So I won't go on and on and describe the internal specs too much in this review. Out of the box, this laptop is very light.  I was expecting a little more heft to it, but that was not the case.  Upon my initial charge, it booted up extremely quickly.  You have to go through the initial language and security setup, and then you are set to use the computer.  You have 3 options for logging in - Password, Pass-Key, and fingerprint identification (Found on the right hand side of the laptop).  I try to utilize the fingerprint, but it sometimes has issues identifying, so I divert to using another method, but that is not a big deal.  I think I probably just need to re-setup my fingerprint ID. There is a ton of storage on this laptop!  On top of the 256GB SSD drive installed, there is an additional 1 TB of internal storage to use!  This is great for my needs as I need a lot of storage for photos, documents and videos.  I had previously taken all of my documents and files from an old laptop, and transferred them to an external for backup.  When I went to transfer those files to this laptop, it went lightning fast!  I have never transferred such a large amount of data so quickly!  I was very impressed and encouraged that this was a very good quality device. The size of this laptop is slightly larger than a iPad Tablet, and is also then touch screen enabled.  You can fold it over and use it as a tablet if you desire (The screen will give you the option to use as \"Tablet Mode\".)  I can see this being good if I am travelling on either a train or plane, and space is limited.  Also good if you want to relax on the couch, and surf the internet.  A nice feature of the body of this laptop. Lastly, this has plenty of slots needed to attach external devices to it.  There are both two USB ports, and one USB-C port.  I find this perfect, as should you need more, you can always purchase an additional docking station, that you can connect and add other devices to, while not losing the USB C port.  This computer is also Bluetooth enabled.  I am not a fan of using track-pads, so I am able to connect a Bluetooth mouse to it, and save a port that way. In closing, this is a very solidly made laptop, that is both fast and practical.  The biggest pro for me has got to be the speed, both in utilizing programs or the internet, as well as transfer speeds, to and from external storage.  This laptop gets the job done, and it gets it done fast!","I went without a laptop for probably 10 years using just my iPad, but at the end of the day, there are just things a laptop can do that the iPad can't and I finally decided to buy a new one.  A couple years ago I did TONS of research and ended up buying a 15\" HP Spectre X360 2-in-1 and it has been the most incredible laptop I've ever seen, let alone used, so I am DEFINITELY convinced of HP's ability to make a great 2-in-1 machine.  My husband needed a new one so we got this for him and I compared it head to head with my Spectre and I was incredibly impressed at how well it performed in comparison when the Spectre cost twice as much as this laptop! Before I get into how they compare, I want to state that this laptop is PERFECT for almost everyone!  The only people who would probably need a beefier system like the Spectre would be those who intend to use it for: -Heavy video editing (I run a lot of Adobe Premiere Pro) -Serious gaming -3D animation -Running CAD software For everyone else, this Pavilion is going to perform like a rockstar! Here are some of the differences\/comparisons between my $1,400 Spectre and this Pavilion: -Boot up times were pretty much identical (about 8 seconds), however the setup on this Pavilion was the fastest and easiest computer set up experience I've ever had! -Spectre's display resolution is higher (4K), but the Pavilion's display is still really crisp and beautiful! -Spectre has facial recognition unlock whereas Pavilion uses fingerprint unlock, which honestly works better, more reliably and faster than my Spectre's facial recognition. -The touch screen sensitivity and response to my active pen stylus is exactly the same. -Both have Bang Olusen speakers that sound fabulous for a laptop! -The backlit keyboards and touch pads are equally responsive and the keys have a great feel to the action. -The Pavilion is smaller and weighs less which is really nice for students or people who carry their laptops everywhere. In short, the Spectre is bigger (but heavier) has more storage, more RAM, an i7 chip vs Pavillion's i5, a 4k display and a beefier graphics card than the Pavilion, but honestly, unless you're doing a lot of heavy duty video editing like I am or intense gaming, you will truly not notice that the Pavilion is lacking in any way, and you'll save a LOT of money! In terms of how this system compares of other brands of laptop, I compared this with my colleagues MacBook and Dell laptops and I felt like this machine was superior to both in just about every way, especially because of the ability to go into tablet mode!  My husband is the director of manufacturing for a major company and has said that this laptop is the best he's ever used.  It's lightning fast, has ample storage and he loves the design, look and feel!  His last laptop had a shiny finish that was a fingerprint magnet and this mat finish is not at all! In summary, for the price, this is about as good of a laptop as you're going to find with such impressive specs, and I can personally vouch for HP's customer service and how well built and high performance their laptops are.  I can absolutely recommend this laptop with no reservations!","After years of dealing with electronics that were absolute junk from HP, I swore I would never again allow an HP product into my house. In January I bought my mom and HP laptop, and now I have this little one. I am glad to see that HP has learned from their past mistakes and made some changes. This little laptop is fast. The touch screen is very responsive and makes it easier to use in a hurry. It easily converts into a tablet when you need it and back to laptop by just folding it backwards. I have a Toshiba that also does this, but it is much bigger and makes too big of a tablet. This HP is the perfect size. The processor and RAM can handle several tasks at once with ease. It can handle some PC games, but nothing too fancy. The keyboard is actually really nice: the keys are spaced appropriately and have a nice feel to them. The backlit keys make it much easier to type in dim light. The compact size makes it great for travel, making it an excellent laptop to tote to and from work. One thing I don't like is it does get a little hot when charging, and it charges really fast, which is probably why it gets so hot. With so many reports of batteries overheating and catching fire, I can't help but wonder about the safety of this one. I'm sure it has gone through vigorous testing to ensure it's safe, it just still concerns me. Overall,this is a powerful little laptop in a nice, compact size that isn't too thin you feel like it will break. It is perfect for work or college because of it's capabilities to handle tasks and it's easily-portable size.","I was looking to replace my chromebook and wanted to give this laptop a try.  Here are some specs: Dimensions: 12.73 in (W) x 8.82 in (D) x 0.80 in (H) Weight: 3.52 pounds Memory: 8 GB, not expandable Storage:  1.128 TB One of the best features is the fingerprint reader to unlock it versus typing in your password each time.  Also, the Intel processor is very quick  and the touch screen responds smoothly. I have a few issues with this laptop.  I'm having connectivity issues with the wifi adapter.  When it is connected, it works great.  However, it disconnects from wifi frequently, even when I am close by to the router. Another problem is the battery life is shorter than what I expected.  I am using it for internet research, not streaming at all, and the battery discharges after about 4.5 hours.  Finally, the fan is on almost always and concerns me that it is overheating. For the price, I don't think it is worth it.","Quality laptop with solid performance specs, that's relatively compact, looks sharp, and is a great choice for everyday tasks or use. However, while it can play games, it\u2019s not the best laptop for serious gamers. Things I liked: * Compact size and thin profile. It's not tiny, but it's similar to a MacBook Air. In the pics I have it next to a Dell XPS 13\" (same size as a MacBook Air) and next to a MacBook Pro 15\".  You can see the size falls somewhere in the middle, and the width is about right. * The screen folds around like a tablet, which could be very useful for meetings or activities where a tablet would be easier to work with. (Granted, windows 10 in tablet mode isn\u2019t great, but that's not the laptop's fault.) Processing performance: *I included geekbench scores if you're into that sort of thing. Even though this is an I5 it blows previous generation I7's out of the water. I found this a little surprising. Graphics performance: * Geekbench graphics scores are included as well. This is not a dedicated GPU so it's no monster, but for integrated graphics, it fares pretty well. * Yes, it plays Fortnite just fine. Fortnite plays best on low graphics settings. The best we found though was low quality settings, resolution at 100% and full screen, not windowed full screen. This was significantly better than the default settings that Fortnite picks. * Also, the default graphics mode was for maximum battery life, even when the laptop is plugged in. I was able to get ~ 15% better graphics scores in benchmarks by opening the \"intel graphics control panel\", \"power\", selecting \"plugged in\" and changing it to \"max performance\". Storage: * The drives are about average as far as performance goes, see pics. * The fact that the laptop has two drives is a really nice feature. The SSD for the OS is a little small, but the 1TB spinning disk more than makes up for that and is fairly unique in this price range. To me this is a very good selling point. Fit and finish: * The laptop feels well built. Does not feel cheap at all. * The trackpad is better than most windows laptops. It's not as good as a mac, but as far as windows trackpads, it's the best in our house. It's on par with the XPS 13's trackpad. * The keys are nice and I can type well on the keyboard. (I'm a fast typist.) Misc. notes: * The icons are huge by default. Right click on desktop, go to display settings and scale. Default was 150%, it really should be lower. 100% is a little small; 125% is just right. When the icons were sized so large, it made the screen feel small, but it's not a small screen. * The fans are a little loud compared to the other laptops we have sitting around (which is too many dells, macs and lenovos.)","I have been needing a new computer for a while, and thought it was time to graduate to a touch-screen unit. I like having a full keyboard and mouse pad capabilities, but it's also nice to be able to touch a point on a screen and go, rather than just scrolling down or using a mouse. When I first started the computer, Cortana came on and wanted to walk me through the set-up, installation, registration and whatnot on this machine. It had a nice, soothing voice that may be reassuring to newbies. However, I am not a fan of voice programs, so I deactivated this feature. There are three ways to log into this computer: 1) You can use the fingerprint reader on the side, but it does not always work for me. I suppose this will get better as I learn the precise placement over the strip. 2) You can enter a pin code of at least four digits. 3) You can enter a password. With its small size this laptop is quite portable. It will fit into just about any backpack, briefcase, satchel or even a large hand bag. The screen is a bit smaller than I would prefer, but you can adjust the font and display sizes to make it more comfortable. It is lightweight and considerably thinner than my other laptop. It has 2 USB ports, an HDMI port, a mini-USB port, a medium memory card port, and a headphone jack port on the sides. The power button is on the side, as well as a fingerprint reader for security. There is no data cable port, so you'll have to connect via USB or wirelessly to other devices or internet. Although small, this computer is mighty by way of storage and speed. It's got a 1TB SATA hard drive, plus a 128GB solid state drive. So there is plenty of storage for your photos, films, music and other files. I would prefer it if the device only had solid state drives, since they tend to last longer. 8GB of RAM provides you with plenty working memory. Unfortunately, it's not upgradable. The Intel Core i5 processor and graphics make it run nice and fast. The screen is HD, which makes for crisp, clear images when streaming movies, gaming or editing photos. This laptop comes with a standard QWERTY keyboard with numbers, soft keys, etc. Other buttons let you rewind, pause or play an audio or video clip, brighten or dim your screen, back light or turn off the illumination on your keys, etc. At the touch of a button, you can instantly place your computer on airplane mode. The keyboard, though compact, has very comfortably sized and spaced keys on it. I like that they are nearly silent when you press them, unlike some keyboards that tend to click when I type. This keyboard has an option to back light the keys and their characters, so you can type or do gaming in the dark. I like that the built-in touch pad has a lot of different gestures you can use to navigate on this computer. I don't use all of them, but it's nice to have choices. This computer is supposed to have enhanced graphics and sound system for gaming, video and other purposes. I did not notice a tremendous difference from what I had by way of image quality, but the sound was good. It's got some really good speakers on it. I was able to hear and clearly understand the dialogue of a movie from across a large room. You can mute, raise or lower the sound with the touch of a button across the top of the keyboard. The screen can be rotated all the way around to the back of the keyboard, so you can use it as a tent display or like a tablet. However, you cannot detach it. It will also auto-rotate like a tablet or cell phone, if you like. The touch screen is pretty accurate and responsive. It works great for selecting buttons, swiping, scrolling, hand-writing notes or signatures and drawing. I didn't find it works that great for highlighting and selecting large areas on the screen. Neither was the touch pad the best for this purpose. Again, that may become better with practice. The computer comes with Windows 10 Home Edition, which is designed to work with the touch screen. There really weren't any other programs installed on it. There are just links to take you to websites to access apps and programs. If you have a Microsoft account, you can log in and do stuff. Otherwise, you'll have to either pay for a subscription, work online or download what you need to do the work or activities you want to use the laptop for. Since there is no CD port on this device, you won't be able to load programs that way, nor can you play a music or video CD or DVD without an external device. The lithium ion battery in this computer will hold a charge for over 8 hours of continuous use. It recharges pretty quickly. I am concerned that the charging cable jack seems a bit loose. I worry that it may break off or the port may break in time. It is nice that the jack is at an angle, rather than straight like my other one. The charger itself is much smaller and lighter than others I have used. The price tag on this computer seems a bit steep for no bigger than it is. If you need something lightweight, compact and portable, then this may be the computer for you. Just try to get it on sale, and I think you will be happy with the investment.","I was looking for a good basic computer, basically for email and writing.  I was possibly also looking to set up multiple accounts and let my (really young ages 1, 3, and 6) kids use the computer. For email, writing, and basic internet, this computer is fine.  I went through and installed the software I regularly use, like Open Office and that kind of thing. Pros: Suprisingly slim and lightweight.  It has a higher end feel when I'm carrying it than about any other laptop I have.  I've tended to get Dell computers, and I think HP is a bit more design oriented. Nice little details.  Like the keyboard has \"page up\" and \"page down\" buttons along the right hand side in a good place and layout for browsing the internet without looking at the keyboard and without holding the FN button. Has a touchscreen (a first for me). You can switch it to tablet mode, by folding the screen all the way back.  (And, it converts to tablet mode, pops up a message that it's in tablet mode, and locks the keyboard, so you can't accidentally bump the keyboard.) Screen does go all the way to the edge, with only about 1\/4 inch to spare on each side.  So, you use the full width of the computer. Camera is pretty good quality. It also seems to do well adjusting to dimmer lighting situations.  With video conferencing such a big part of work and school and job interviewing, this probably matters more than most people tend to think looking at a checklist.  (I actually only went and checked it out, because HP makes a big deal of the camera in their promo stuff.) Camera has a light right next to the lens along the top of the screen. When the light is on, the camera is on. Camera is indeed wider angle.  If you have a group of people, and not just one, you can all fit in without too much positioning.  This could be good for family use or meetings between two remote groups. like where several people are in a conference office, and several people are off alone. Charger plugs in along the side, not the back. I find this is better for charging while using, because I don't bang the charger plug, and can tilt the laptop back while typing. SSD for harddrive makes random things fast.  Like, restart feels faster than other computers I use. Cons: It feels like this boots me off the wifi more frequently than other computers or devices.  It's very common to have to disconnect and reconnect. Fan seems to kick on quickly, so I'm not sure whether this is heating up.  It's not very loud, but I always worry about stress on the computer when the fan is running. This comes with Windows 10 home.  One huge bad thing that I don't like is it makes you register an account with Microsoft to even use the computer.  So, you have to have internet available when you first set up the computer.  Then, if you make any other accounts on the computer, you have to make a Microsoft account for each of them as well.  To register, you need either a phone number or email address, and if you don't have one, then it has you create an email address at @outlook.com .  Previous versions of Microsoft, you don't need to register any account, much less each account. I tend to register the admin account with a password, then make a non-admin account for day to day use.  That way, software installing prompts me for a password, and I feel it's harder to pick up viruses.  Also, like I'd said, I was thinking to maybe let my kids use this, and they definitely would get a less dominant account.  Having to register each user account on the computer with Microsoft is a huge negative.  This is a Windows 10 home thing, and is the future or present for now, so it will be a negative of any computer you get, but that's what you are stuck with here.  I feel the online account management is kind of awful, since my vibes are that eventually Microsoft will discontinue support for the older computers to be able to access the online centers at all, so the laptop won't be useful as a hand me down (or will be but you gotta install Linux). Couldn't get fingerprint login to work at all.  I can't on my phone either, and I feel I must have extra oily fingers or something. As far as using with kids, I had the nagging suspicion that the laptop wouldn't be a good way to go.  That's true.  For little, little kids, it really has to be a desktop to keep the computer safe from them.  Nevertheless, this has good parental controls on it.  To set up the child's account you need a phone number or email address and have to make a Microsoft account (which I hate).  Then, you really can't do much from Windows control panel.  You have to log into Microsoft's website and manage the child's account from there.  I was able to quickly block some websites, and make a list of allowed websites, which is about all I want to do (and which wasn't available in Windows XP home but has been available in every later home version of Windows).  It had some interesting things in there.  Like you can select an age level of content to allow, and I guess there's some automatic filter.  Then it had where you can add money to the child's Microsoft account and they can use it for online purchases, with an option to require parental approval at the time of purchase or not. Overall, this seems like a good basic laptop for school or business use.","The laptop looks nice and sleek. It's a median sized screen, which is good on a laptop, but turns into a very large tablet. My favorite part, is the keyboard. The keys are perfectly sized and spaced for easy finger reach. Typing feels very natural on it, with few mistakes. The option to have the keyboard backlit is a really nice addition. The function keys are sensibly placed, giving options like screen brightness, toggling the backlight on the keyboard, airplane mode, volume, and video play options (fast forward, rewind, etc.) Con: the laptop overheats quickly and the fan is loud and annoying in the background. I like how easy it is to switch between computer and tablet mode. There's also an option to work as a desktop while in the tablet shape. The hinges feel sturdy enough to withstand a lot of switching. The touchscreen responds nice and quickly. It also responds to touchscreen pens, which I prefer to use over fingers, so I don't smudge the screen. The screen is nice and glossy and hasn't smudged yet despite usage. It was very easy to setup and use. The setup process barely took a few minutes. Battery life - not so great. It's down to about 25% after only about 2 hrs of constant high powered usage (gaming). It drains quickly even without high powered use. Speaking of gaming, this laptop won't work for hard gaming, but nicely runs median tiered games. If you don't have gaming peripherals, having a touchscreen helps out a bit. I love the fast bootup, but that's expected given the SSD. The speakers sound pretty good. The mic didn't pick up my voice right away, but I didn't try too hard, and simply disabled it asap since I noticed it was constantly recording all background sounds. (Hello, spies) Internet speed is great, and it's got 5G. Bottom line: I think this makes a great machine for the average home\/student user. I plan to login to work occasionally, and use it for some simple gaming, home usage, and lots of internet browsing. This is perfect for students. Again, I really like how perfectly the keyboard keys are sized and spaced for speedy and accurate typing.","I only use my home computer\/laptop for surfing the Internet, checking email, uploading photos to Internet storage sites, selling on eBay, and storing iTunes music (yes, I'm still one of those people who do that, thanks to my CD collection from years past).  None of this should require a lot from a computer.  So, to be honest, I don't know a lot about computer specifications, memory, processor speed, blah, blah, blah.  I only know whether a computer\/laptop works well and performs the basic functions it should that allows me to do what I want to do at a good speed.  My laptop before this one was a Dell.  It worked great...until it didn't.  It is incredibly slow at only a couple of years old, even for the most mundane tasks now, and I hardly use it.  And when I do use it, it's just for the above.  I'm not doing any fancy gaming, etc. that should require a lot from a computer.  I've typically bounced back and forth between HP and Dell computers, being burned by both in the past.  So far, this little HP laptop hasn't failed me, but they're all great at first.  It's smaller than I'm used to (and my eyesight isn't as good as it used to be), but I can easily take the laptop from room to room.  I've gone from a 15.6\" display to this 14\" one.  But the processor speed, computer memory, and processor count are all better on this one than my previous Dell one (but this one is also $200 more).  The webcam seems to work decently, too, because my stepdaughter had to use it for a school project.","It's not hyperbole for me to say I love this laptop. After working with glitchy, draggy old computers for the last year or so, this is a huge revelation for me.  Not only is it fast on a task-to-task basis, but the startup and shutdown processes are incredibly fast. It's not wasting my time.  Nor does it waste my time with a lot of bloatware.  Yes there is some, but most is easy to remove should you not want it. I like a smaller screen and keyboard, so this is perfect for me, and it's lightweight and has a slim profile, so it's easy to take along when I'm out and about. I love the way it converts to a tablet when you fold the screen back. Even the fingerprint recognition is dramatically better than anything I've had before.  One thing I was skeptical about was the placement of the power button on the side. I was sure I'd be turning the laptop on or off accidentally, but I've discovered that it's not that simple, which is a load off my mind. I could wish for a couple more USB ports particularly as I use both a wireless mouse and because there's no disk drive, so I have to attach an external one when I want to access files on disk. Eh, I'll survive it. There are always work-arounds. Bottom line is that this laptop is a perfect match for me.  I'm a writer (not a gamer) and this runs all the software I need, runs it fast and efficiently, and has tremendous storage capacity for all my files. I really couldn't have asked for more.  Nicely done, HP.","If you can\u2019t decide if you would rather have a laptop or a tablet, the HP Pavilion X360 14-Inch convertible laptop gives you both.  As you rotate the screen backwards, a dialog box pops up and asks if you want to convert to the table mode.  Clicking the YES box converts to the tablet format.  Move the screen back toward the normal position and the dialog box pops up and ask if you wish to convert to the laptop mode. The convertible feature is neat, but I much prefer to work in the laptop mode. The HP X360 is a sleek looking, compact with all the features I want or need in a laptop.  It is lightweight and very thin.  The screen is very sharp and in the table mode is very responsive to the touch. The set up is fast and easy.  Setting up the computer, installing my preferred spyware, anti-virus and updating Windows took less than half an hour. The only thing I need to get used to was the touch screen.  It is very responsive but it did operate slightly different than the one I was used to. It has 8 GB of SDram (not upgradeable) but this is plenty fast for all my needs. The hard drive is 1 T solid state.  The fan does make a slight noticeable hum when the laptop is being used. I'm certainly not a geek user - so I am more concerned with the ease of use for the average person.  This laptop\/tablet is fast and easy to use.  It meets my needs very nicely.","This is a good laptop for an average user like myself.  Really like the touchscreen and swivel capability to easily switch back and forth between a regular laptop and tablet.  Like setting it up in a tent fashion when I'm playing music so that the speakers are upright and facing front. This has a lot of storage space, is fast, and able to handle multiple windows at once.  I've mainly been using it to edit documents and spreadsheets, general web surfing, and streaming; and so far have been impressed.  Backlit keyboard is nice and convenient too.  Also think the size of this laptop is perfect.  I thought it would be bulkier, but it's actually got a very nice slim design, and has been really easy to just slip in and out of my bag.  So far the only thing I haven't been all that happy with is the fingerprint reader.  It's just a little slit and it had issues trying to read my fingerprint, so ended up giving up on that.  It also seems to get hot easily, but haven't seen any issues result from that yet per se.  And just a personal preference, but I do miss having a CD\/DVD reader built right in (yes, I am that old school). Otherwise this is a great laptop that's got a lot of functionality built in.  Very satisfied!","I have an earlier version of this split laptop and boy has this come a long way. My original split has 500 GB 5400 rpm SATA. This one has 1 TB Hybrid Drive. The old one has Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 i3-6100U with Intel\u00ae HD Graphics 520 (2.3 GHz, 3 MB cache, 2 cores) and this one has Intel 3.9 GHz Core i5 Family. The old memory is 6 GB DDR4-1866 SDRAM (1 x 2 GB, 1 x 4 GB). This one has 8 GB DDR4. Line by line of features is upgraded substantially. This is a split because it can be a tablet also. The cover will fold over and you have a nice sized tablet. My old one had a failure with a Windows Beta update and the hard drive had to be replaced and when that happened, the new hard drive was replaced and it went to Windows 7, so I stopped using it. You don't know how happy I am to see my favorite laptop\/tablet ever. It is a little bit bigger and weighs a little bit more, but I can work with that. I like the new touchprint feature too. Now, if they can give it a liquid cooling system.","The screen on this laptop is beautiful - colors are vivid and clear, the display is bright, and the touch sensitivity is as it should be. Set up was consistent with setting up other laptops and computers. Cortana can walk you through the setup but I found that I still had to press enter for many of the choices. Otherwise, it works as expected with Windows 10. It seems pretty speedy and the fingerprint reader works well, although it's a little tough to find quickly. I was able to do all of the usual Windows customizations and uploading of Office and a few other apps. The only negative is that to keep things updating correctly, you should check both the Windows update and the HP updates (HP updates are for the hardware) and, unfortunately, they are in two different places . Otherwise, this is a really nice laptop and the articulating touchscreen is really cool.","Very impressed with this laptop. Very nice design and look. Love the back lit keyboard, makes it very easy to see in a dark room. Placement of the buttons are all perfect. Speakers are loud and clear. Screen size is just right. Setup was easy and fast. I was using it right out of the box, did not need to charge before using the laptop, just needed to be plugged into the wall. My oy complaint would be that there is no disk drive, but this is not a deal breaker for me. I can live without it. I'm loving the touchscreen, it makes things so much easier and faster. Had no issues with it whatsoever. Overall, I'm very happy with this laptop. Love the way it looks, audio is great, awesome keyboard and perfect screen size.","I've only ever used dedicated laptops (mostly Dell, Lenovo and HP) and tablets (iPad). Since I'm more of a Windows user I was excited to see how this would work. It's easy to convert from laptop to tablet mode; I found Windows 10 use via the touchscreen to be super intuitive and responsive. Great for sitting in bed and catching up with movies and TV shows. It's certainly powerful enough for MS Office 365 and Google Docs. I've played a few desktop games on it  and it works well, but it's definitely not a gaming laptop. Super light and slim form factor. The Battery lasts ages too. Very happy!","HP Pavilion X360 14-Inch Convertible Laptop, Intel Core I5-8265U Processor, 8 GB RAM, 1 TB Hard Drive & 128 ssd Now that I have used a touch screen laptop I can never go back. This is something I didn't know I needed, but now that I have it, it's something I can't live without. The response of the screen is great and I don't notice any lag. I don't flip the screen around to use it like a tablet very often, but it's nice to have the option to do so. For the PC, it's 128gb ssd is fast. Windows startup and applications load quickly. The 8gb of ram help the applications feel snappy and is sufficient for doing day to day work. This is not a gaming laptop by any means, but does feel quite powerful. It doesn't have a dedicated GPU and uses the 8th gen I5 to host the graphics. That being said the 8th gen I5 is no slouch. It turbos up to 3.9 ghz and has 4 cores, so you should be plowing through most tasks with ease. The additional 1tb hard drive helps a lot because the 128gb ssd just isn't enough in 2019. The size and weight of the laptop is well balanced and has a very high quality feel. The battery life is great and I have gone all day with out having to plug it in. Obviously, you mileage may very depending on how hard you are working the system. The keyboard and the track pad have a very responsive feel. It has a fingerprint reader on the side for easy login which is a great feature I wish they ditched the 1tb spinning drive and just put in a 1tb ssd. I also wish it had 16gb of ram or the option to add more later. For the price, this laptop is pretty great. I wouldn't nock off any stars for those two points. Having a 1tb ssd and 16gb of ram would put this over $1000 and probably not necessary for most people. Overall, best laptop I've owned hands down."],"1":["Let me begin by stating the intial reasons I was drawn to this laptop. It was advertised to have a backlit keyboard (which is a must for me as I tend to work in very dimly lit areas), it was advertised to have a good battery life, fingerprint scanner for added security and generally  that it was a goiod functioning laptop for college students. The keyboard was malfunctioning from the moment I tried setting it up. It would not let me use the symbols @ or any of the SHIFT+ number symbols on the keyboard, making it impossible for me to set it up. COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. AMAZON YOU ARE A DISAPPOINTMNET. They offered me a return however because I live in Trinidad and Tobago, the return label for UPS was only valid in the US, meaning it would cost me nearly $150 USD to ship the item back to the US and hence I was unable to return it. Very disappointed.","This comes with Windows 10 in S Mode, which means you can only download apps available at the Microsoft store. However, you can opt out of it by going to Settings > Update & Security > Activation. There is no charge for this. This is a good device for the price range. It is fast - faster than what I'm used to anyway - and the touchscreen is a nifty feature. Potential buyers should note that this device does not include a DVD drive and has only one usb portal.","This did not come with fingerprint reader nor facial recognition...what a disappointment","Considering its price point, the Lenovo Flex 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop is a very good choice for those looking for a computer for online browsing, e-mail, and most applications. I haven't spent much time with PC laptops in some years (although I do use a PC desktop), but I've been favorably impressed with the ease of setup (very simple, unless you count my frustration getting around Win 10's confusing and super-annoying requirement to download a button to get out of S mode so I could immediately download my preferred browser, Chrome--something that's no fault of Lenovo's) build quality, and responsiveness of the keyboard. The touchscreen works amazingly well, allowing you to use it as a tablet, and memory seems adequate for my rather pedestrian writerly uses (I'm not a gamer), though I believe there's one slot available to upgrade RAM if you're running greedier applications. Video ran well, and audio quality out of the onboard speakers was better than expected. A couple of USB ports and an SD card reader, along with the expected headphone jack. The solid state hard drive is a good choice for the on the go, so much more reliable than earlier styles. What didn't I love about it? The screen quality, I felt, was somewhat disappointed, the images not as sharp and clear as we're used to seeing on many desktops or laptops (and certainly in newer smartphones) these days. I'm not sure this is a sacrifice that was made due to the touchscreen functionality, or it's just a price point issue, but it was the very first thing I noticed--and I'm not comparing it to an Apple Retina display or anything special but a nearly six-year-old Macbook Air that I use daily. The more I used the Lenovo, the less it bothered, but it is not going to be the best and brightest screen. Also, the Lenovo's keyboard, while good enough, doesn't have the springy, solid feel I love, nor is it quite as responsive as I'm used to. Despite these caveats, this is a lot of computer for the money, one that would be a great choice for many students, budget users, and those without heavy graphic\/gaming needs. Our household has in the past gotten very good service from a Lenovo laptop, and I expect this solidly built and versatile 2-in-1 to be another welcome addition.","Very responsive to the touch screen and it\u2019s about on par with my iPad as far as the touch goes. Boot up is fairly speedy. I can say for windows this is pretty good.","Laptop met its promise: lightweight, long battery life, good touch screen. I haven't installed a lot of programs yet but for the time being is very good.","I've recently switched my work machine from a MacBook Pro to a high-end Windows machine, and decided for consistency that perhaps I should replace my personal MacBook with another Windows system, just to keep life simple. (Syncing passwords and bookmarks - that kind of thing.) The MacBook is hard to replace, however, because it's so insanely light - just 2 pounds. This is a challenge. My first attempt was to get a Microsoft Surface Go. Gorgeous screen, really light, full Windows, and a surprisingly good keyboard. But the performance really sucks: it has a \"Pentium Gold\" CPU, and it only clocks in at 604 on the Novabench benchmark. My work machine (Huawei MateBook X Pro Signature; core i7, 16GB) scores 1459 on the same test. And then Amazon offered me a Lenovo IdeaPad Flex14 to review. Although it's the lowest end of the (vast) IdeaPad range, with a core i3 and just 4GB of RAM, I decided to try it out. My verdict: middling. Not as bad as I'd feared from the specs, but not great. The best points: Performance is snappier than I expected (Novabench comes in at 988), and I never found the 4GB to be a serious limit. The battery life is perfectly good: I streamed a 6 hour YouTube video, and although it did pop up a battery warning at the end, the system was still good for another 45 minutes of moderate usage. The touch screen was responsive and accurate. The keyboard was adequate; there was a sense of \"bottoming out\" on the keystrokes which made it feel laggy, but (objectively) typing was just as fast and error-free. However, the screen and weight really let things down. Yes, I shouldn't expect a 1366x768 screen to compare to a 3000x2000 one, but even so, text looked fuzzy and the brightness was remarkably poor.  (Side by side, the IdeaPad at 100% brightness was about as bright at the MateBook X Pro at 40%.) And on the IdeaPad, a blank, white screen had a distinctly blue-grey cast to it. (My partner just looked over my shoulder at the screen, and described it as \"old school\" - the kind of screen we expected on a laptop 5+ years ago.) And the weight. It's 3.65 lbs., which is three-quarters of a pound heavier than the MateBook X Pro and nearly two and a half pounds heavier than the Surface Go. The idea of using the 360\u00b0 hinge to flip the machine around to become a tablet is quite impractical. All in all, it's moderately priced, and the performance is better than expected. But we can do better in 2019; give your eyes and your shoulder muscles a break.","This is an exceptional computer if you manage your expectations, which for the solid build and price point, you obviously should manage on the performance front. First, the size is ideal.  Those 15.6 computers do not give you that much more experience, and are simply much harder to tote around.  This laptop is the perfect size to retain a great typing experience, fits on a tray on an airplane easily, slides into all my backpacks, even the kinda small ones, and it's just easy to handle and balance on a leg or whatever.  The size is great. The touchscreen is responsible and looks fine.  It's not a brilliant display, but it looks good.  You can put the laptop in a tent shape for movies if you like.  Sound is average to poor, but honestly if I'm watching movies I use headphones, and if I'm at home I pair to my surround sound, so I only need the laptop's included audio for notifications. Typing is average at best.  If you need to type a lot, I highly recommend spending the same amount of money on a refurbished T440 or similar.  Same size computer, lacking the touchscreen and some of the whizbang, but with a more legitimate keyboard.  This one feels smooth and slick, and I can type pretty quickly on it, but the travel is pretty short, meaning my banging typing is not as comfortable.  the keyboard is not backlit, which is the only area I truly miss with this. Performance for webbrowsing and word processing is actually pretty good.  The included SSD helps.  It's obviously limited on RAM.  My phone has more.  This isn't for modern games.  I would caution against upgrading.  It's possible.  Lenovo solders in RAM an awful lot.  But in this case, I think the style of case really isn't one you should tear down.  Again, get the refurbished Thinkpad (something designed for more maintenance) if you plan to upgrade. I've used this Lenovo exclusively for university, browsing at home, watching movies, and Amazon reviews.  I use it with Word (not included of course) and I have really not been bothered at all my the memory being 4 gbs.  I also don't mind the small hard drive capacity, as if you're using this for web and Word, it is more than enough. Tablet mode is really cool.  The screen creates a deadzone to make it easy to hold, and the keys turn off, so it's easy to use.  I am amazed this didn't include the stylus.  it's still easy to use and I had a lot of fun doodling on this thing. I'll also add that battery life is at least 8 hours of use.  And the power brick is tiny... close to a phone's.  It's really easy to live with this. Finally, simple fit and finish.. this is metallic feeling laptop that is thin and solid.  It feels like one piece of material.  It looks classier than the price suggests.  Yeah, in a room of Macbooks it's clearly not the ritzy computer, but you can use this and not worry so much about it.  It's a terrific value.  I had to knock a star off for the typing, but it was hard to do that.  I really want to give this 5 stars just based on how it feels, but it isn't the most powerful laptop.","I am not normally a fan of touch screen laptops, but this computer might have changed my mind.  It seamlessly switches depending on the orientation of the laptop. Beautiful. The screen is bright and vibrant and the resolution is super sharp. Battery life is amazing and the quick charge to 80% in an hour is the best. I use it to model and 3D print. My kids play games  on it and my wife browses with it. It can handle everything. The keyboard is great too, feels good and easy to know you typed. It\u2019s suoeecthis and light but really powerful.","Several years ago, my uncle suffered a stroke and is now paralyzed on one side of his body and cannot walk.  Mentally, he is sharp and has use of one arm and hand.  Because he rarely ventures outside his care facility, his computer is his only source to connect to the \"outside world\" via the internet.  A few months ago, I discovered that my uncle's computer died.  When I learned of him being computerless, I ordered this laptop for him. Before visiting him and surprising him with this special gift, I went through the process of setting up the computer for him so it would be easy enough to \"plug and play\" when he received it.  It's incredible all of the hoops that you have to go through to set up a brand new computer nowadays.  I didn't see any way to bypass things like providing a Microsoft user account, creating a sign-in, etc.  I ended up putting in my own information because I thought it wouldn't really affect the outward appearance for another user.  Wrong.  It ended up creating more problems because it was now tied to me and my information.  I eventually was able to create my uncle as another user, then turn him into an administrator, and then remove myself.  This seemingly disconnected my information from the laptop so if anyone else logged on, they wouldn't have access to my information.  After the long 30-45 minute process, it seemed to be operating the way I wanted it to, with just a log in for him because, no, I don't know the name of his 3rd grade teacher, best friend as a child, or first favorite food.  I'm just trying to surprise him with a computer! Anyway, now that the computer was up and running, I decided to try to download the Google Chrome browser.  NOPE.  Not without having to deactivate something in the computer.  Nice new tactic, Microsoft, but not everyone loves Microsoft Edge.  I left Edge as his one and only web browser. Connecting to Wi-Fi was an easy task, as was searching and surfing the internet, which was to be the main task of the laptop.  The laptop also easily converts to a tablet by inverting the keyboard.  The keyboard then serves as a stand for the tablet portion.  A message pops up when you convert it to a tablet or back to a laptop.  It senses what you're doing and asks if you want to change the look\/format of the screen to either resemble a tablet with apps or a laptop with a background.  The touch feature seems to be pretty sensitive and work well.  I separately purchased a mouse for my uncle, though, so he could have both options to operate the computer.  The laptop quickly and simply recognized the mouse when it was plugged in and immediately started working.  No need for any other further set-up. The laptop is serving its function for him, and he is enjoying being able to visit his favorite websites again, as well as communicating with people via email. By the way, the ON button is inconveniently placed on the right side of the laptop and barely sticks out and\/or is visible.  I guess maybe it was put here in case you're using it in tablet mode, but I prefer when it's on\/near the keyboard with an actual button that really stands out.  Because the ON button is so hard to find tactilely, I put a little sticker\/note on the keyboard as to where it was on the side so my uncle could more easily find it and hopefully press it.","I have been an iPad user for many years now.  This is my first convertible laptop and I find myself using it more than my iPad now. The convenience of having both a laptop with a keyboard, and then a tablet with a touch screen is the best both worlds. It amazes how lightweight it is. The screen is unbelievably vivid and has superb HD quality graphics.  The battery life is super long, I can use it for most of the day without any worries.  If I could change anything it would be the touchpad.  I wish it had left and right buttons instead of having to use both hands and\/or double fingers to get steps accomplished. I downloaded  Microsoft Office 2017 with no problems and it runs smoothly.  This laptop does not come with any programs except trial programs.  So keep in mind you will have to build it to your likings.","I took this laptop out of the box and set it up easily.  Microsoft has done a lot of work on making Windows easier to set up and use over the years.  Most of the setup prompts allowed either voice or typing to answer the questions.  I typed everything.  Honestly I found little value in the voice setup, but maybe that is more comfortable for some people. After getting logged in, the first thing I went to do was download and install Chrome.  I'm sure Edge is great, but this computer is for my daughter and all of her passwords and bookmarks are stored in Chrome, so it makes more sense to keep it that way.  Of course, Chrome could not install in the default \"S mode\" configuration of Windows.  But it prompted me right away with the option to upgrade to \"home\" mode, so that was nice.  I didn't have to go digging for it. We also set up office, which came preinstalled.  All I had to do was enter a product key. I think it had to reboot a time or two because of some updates.  But overall the entire setup was painless. After it was all done, I handed the laptop to my daughter to use as a replacement for a very old one that she has been using for school.  We homeschool and all of her classes are online.  We both noticed that the laptop was VERY hot after this initial setup.  I was a little concerned that it would get hot often as she used it. But, so far it hasn't really gotten hot at all and it's been performing great for her very light internet and MS Office use.  At the MSRP of $450, this is a good value for what you get.  It's fast and not too heavy, has a nice screen, and the keyboard is very nice and well laid out (we both like the \"clicky\" nature of the keys). So as long as you go in knowing that this isn't intended for heavy use with high performance applications, I think you'll like this one.  It's perfect for school and priced really well for that usage.  Highly recommended.","We have a couple different laptops and devices in this household and I have to say, this is the one we fight over the most. It's not only lightweight, perfect size, clear and beautifully easy to use, it has the versatility of turning into a tablet which functions much like a giant touch phone. It's super easy to use and makes browsing, watching videos, scrolling through social media and watching movies so much easier. Absolutely hands down our favorite laptop. The touch screen and transition to tablet mode is seamless and easy. No learning curve either, out of the box you can get the hang of it. Much easier to use than our other two laptops.  Great price point, excellent function. Highly recommend!","Overall I think this laptop is a great addition to the family computers...for the price point **. For 400$ I couldn\u2019t really expect much - were an apple product family with one surface floating around here. I am comfortable with the windows operating system but this one was a bit more tricky. I can\u2019t remember what the \u201csafety\u201d mode is but it comes preinstalled so you can\u2019t install any 3rd party apps (i.e. google chrome) without paying to upgrade your operating system. It\u2019s  little silly and windows makes you jump through hoops to get a cheaper priced laptop (I.e. paying for upgrades to install apps, upgrade RAM, etc). If you\u2019re looking for something super simple for, say, your elder parents or a young kid - go for it. Otherwise, spend the cash on something like a newer surface (I bought mine open box at Best Buy for 500$) or a MacBook. Pros: durable, small, works well, price point Cons: super simple, have to shell out extra cash for upgrades"],"2":["For the price, this is an excellent Chromebook. After opening the box, I've done my fair share of research. 1. Solid build at an undefeatable price. Not many things you can do now for 110 bucks. A full tank gas for my SUV costs more than that. 2. USB type C port, SD card slot, and USB 3.0 3. 4 gigs of RAM is good though the 16gb memory is not enough, just insert $3 32gb micros sd card, it is much better than spend $100 more for a 64gb disk. With 20 bucks, we can make it 144GB. Why buy more expensive one. Besides, you have google cloud free for you. 5. Nice feel to the keyboard and track pad. 6. ARM processor that is optimized for the Google play store apps and runs much better than the Intel celerons you see in most low-end Chromebooks. 7. Great for travel. I wanted something I could put in my carry-on, perfect in size and 10 hours movie time on the flight. That is incredible. You get a lot for the low price, it is hard to believe. I think the fair price for this one would be 150 at least. You can't really find those options within that price range. The only thing I wish it had was a touch screeon display. 1366x768 still looks sharp on an 11.6 in screen but it would be super cool if it is a touch screen. I would highly recommend this Chromebook.","This chromebook has a great price and is rugged, lightweight, portable, and truly goes 10+ hours on a charge. So far all the Android apps I\u2019ve wanted are available and loaded from the Google Play store. I\u2019ve added the calculator, Amazon Kindle, Rbdigital, Messages, Calendar, Brother iPrint, Polaris Office, File Manager and Hangouts apps to this Chromebook and still have 7 of the 16GB of SSD available! Gmail, google maps, google keep, youtube and youtube tv work great in the included chrome browser.","Watching video was ok but playing game like pubg honkai impact and candy crush will have a bad lag every 20 second. Otherwise just a regular budget laptop not fast or slow. Just normal","This is a great little Chromebook! It was made by Lenovo for K-12 education so has features like a spill proof keyboard and rubberized edges to protect against drops. Its not very heavy and the size at 11.6\" is perfect for travel. The screen is pretty good--typical for a Chromebook but not ultra high def IPS quality like on an expensive laptop. Since its a Chromebook and not a full fledged laptop it can only have programs that install to the Chrome browser itself. Hard drive space is minimal so you can't download large files unless you store them on an external USB drive or portable drive. If you looking at this laptop, but aren't familiar with Chromebooks, it helps to try them out and do a little research first to see if they will work for what you need. I just needed an inexpensive computer for travel so I wouldn't have to bring my expensive Dell laptop. Its perfect for that.  I've only had it a short time but so far its working great for web surfing, watching YouTube and some word processing via Google Docs. Sometimes thats all you need.","Fair buy for a fair price. Surprisingly lightweight, and a moderate screen size. It runs well, and has an excellent battery life complimented by a fast charging speed. The only thing(s) bringing it down would be the screen and the speakers. The screen is strange- in the sense that no matter what setting you put the brightness at, it\u2019ll always appear like it\u2019s \u201ctoo bright\u201d my guess is that it\u2019s unbalanced saturation. I haven\u2019t found a way to fix that. The speakers are far too quiet than they should be. My phone is louder than this chrome book could ever be. Those 2 downsides aside, a real great laptop for someone who\u2019s not trying to break the bank.","I have been using chromebooks for over 5 years and have enjoyed the experience. I bought this Lenovo 100e because two of my previous chromebooks have reached end of life. Google will no longer update the chrome operating system just as Google will not update android phones after 3 years of use. The updates for chromebooks are better. Most will receive updates for approximately 6 years from the time the model was introduced, not the date that the customer acquired it. The Lenovo 100e second generation was introduced in 2019 and should receive updates to the operating system until 2025 unless Google changes the update policy. The Lenovo 100e is a sturdy machine built to military specifications for the education market. The cover does not show fingerprints. The screen is not IPS, but is clear when not viewed from a sharp angle. There are a limited number of ports. There is only one USB port and one type C port which is used for charging. I would recommend that Lenovo add another USB port and another type C port to the right side of the computer in future iterations of the Lenovo 100e. And I would implore Google to continue to expand the operating system updates for its operating systems. Googles record is deplorable compared to Apple, Microsoft and various Linux distributions. I recommend the Lenovo 100e second generation because it is a good basic machine and ideal for the education market.","I've always been a fire tablet and desktop user and was looking for a laptop so I could starting writing. For the price this is a great laptop. It's very durable and not flimsy. The outside and inside feel is strong and smooth. I went with this chromebook instead of a Windows based one because it has everything I wanted and was affordable to me. Overall I am happy with this laptop and have ordered a second one for my gf!","Not even worth the 100 bucks I paid for it. There, I said it.  Oh I tried to justify it. \"It's only 100 bucks, it ain't so bad\", I kept telling myself. But after a few hours of trying to get things done with the 100E, I just have to admit this to myself: it's just not a good Chromebook and a waste of a Benjamin. Let me preface this by saying that I've had probably 8 or 9 different Chromebooks in my life, of varying sizes and price points. This includes 4 different 11-inchers I've used for various purposes. I'm comparing my experience with the Lenovo with that of those other 11-inch Chromebooks. Apples to apples, and all that. It's such a tempting thing isn't it? For a hundred bucks you get a full fledged Chromebook, and it's even got 4GB of memory which is pretty much the minimum even for Chromebook.Should be at least \"good enough\", right? But jeez this thing has probably THE worst screen of all time. Everything is washed out. Blacks are barely gray. Text is slightly blurry. You can force to resize the resolution within Chrome itself but no matter what, the quality of the screen is just awful. Despite the aforementioned reasonable 4GB of memory, and a -in theory - acceptable processor (MediaTek MT8173C), it's a very sluggish machine. Even basic web browsing just feels slow, like it's fighting to pull up basic web pages. The WiFi radio appears to be a culprit as well, although I haven't run any real tests about that. Point is: even basics are slow with the 100E. They keyboard is black and the key markings (letters) are very dark, so unless you're using this in a well-lit room, you better be a good touch typist. Except of course due to the mini size of this, keys may not be where you think they are. Everything is super cramped so even if you're normally a good touch-typist, you'll be missing keys. It's frustrating but this latter issue is not confined to Lenovo, it's a size thing. What IS a Lenovo thing is the shoddy quality of the keys. Travel is weird (too high) and the keys FEEL like the cheapest plastic possible. Even for a machine that costs 100 bucks I expected more since it comes from Lenovo. But the keys on the 100E are the worst of all my 11-inch Chromebooks. Of course there is no backlighting at this price point. No surprise, and many folks don't feel like they usually need one - but you really need it with a terrible keyboard like this. The top lid is a fingerprint magnet. The body is surprisingly thick and clunky. I do love that it charges via USB-C and has 2 such ports. For this price point you can't expect miracles, but honestly, it's so slow and sluggish, I wouldn't even give this to my 4 year old. (He has a 100 dollar Teqnio Chromebook from Walmart which is astoundingly good for the money, with far better screen, better keys, and faster performance) It's too sluggish to even use as a security camera monitor. You can watch Youtube videos on it but with that awful screen, it won't be pretty. I'm keeping this as a backup to my backup computers, maybe throw it in the back of the car (without being logged in to Google account, for security reasons) or maybe I'll give it to a homeless person or something (hey, free Wifi at McD+ this 100E + free time = next great American novel),  but besides that I just can't recommend it. Not even for 100 bucks.","Liked the price, very useful. What a mess to set-up though. Have bought many laptops recently and the sign up process on Cbooks is usually very simple and straight forward. This one took ages to attach to wifi and sign in. A keeper at the price under a hundred, introductory.","Looks nice, fast charging, and feels sturdy enough. Using it for the google drive\/sheets\/etc. Trying and failing to find a good game to play on it. Got it on sale for ~$90 so i've got nothing to complain about.","For the price it\u2019s Pretty good..But the material including mouse pad is really rough.","really nicely made chromebook","With this such low price, you cannot complain at all. It is a computer, but just priced similar to a tablet's keyboard. And it run smooth and a bit faster than my wife's acer celeron chromebook. The only drawback is its TN screen, the colour look a bit washed out.","Just arrived a few days ago. It looked very nice. The startup was easy. I feel it will need some time to adjust myself to a chrome book as I use Windows for so long. Need to use help menu time to time to find the way to do task.","Great"],"3":["I bought this computer to replace an old Asus laptop.  It had all the features I was looking for at a reasonable price. The reviews had me a little worried because of the mention of how hot the laptop ran.  I don't know why others had a problem with heat.  Mine has been running cool.  Honestly, no heat.  The older Asus I had always ran hot - hot, hot. The Acer is cool by comparisson. Love the features.  The touch screen is easy to use.  The back lit keyboard is very convenient - and it is beautiful!  Yes, it is light weight.  In fact, if I had any to say that might be possibly even the little bit of a bother, is that it is so light that you have to hold the bottom of the the laptop to open it up.  If you just lift the top, you'll pick up the computer. Ah - the price of elegance! Note that it doesn't have a disk drive - if that is important to you. But, it is fast, so much faster than my old laptop.  If you have to work, you might as well work on a computer you love.","We've been using this laptop for about a month now and overall are pretty pleased. It is very lightweight, portable, and fast; everything a college student needs. However for the last two weeks, 2-3 times a day the screen fills with lines and is unreadable. It usually clears up after a few seconds, but it is very annoying. I'm worried about a potential hardware issue that will keep getting worse. Is anyone else having this issue?","I wanted to like it.  Light, portable, lots of decent specs.  Where they made up in these things, the laptop is just not well made.  Keyboard glitches a ton, spacebar only registers if you click the very center of the spacebar - super annoying as i have to go back and re-enter spaces after the fact constantly. The internal frame around the screen literally popped off while opening the laptop once.","I hope this review help other buyers concerning daily usage information. Laptop Lightweight and 15.6 screen are most powerful features. However leftcorner site of the keyboard exactly have a overheating issue and it is very hard to continue working especially when charger plugged. I asked for replacement but this process also went bad due to custom problems. Finally \u0131 have a product with overheating issue and have to use it.","The biggest merit of this product is the weight. I used a 13 inch laptop before, but compared to the past one, this is much lighter-! Furthermore, I got a huge discount on this product on Prime Day. ( I do love Amazin Prime-!!) If ram were 16GB, it would be more perfect but I can't find the option on Amazon.","As soon as you receive your laptop, update it, at least for two days . I received mine and the fan was really noisy. This is only because it was not updated with the new windows. Now the noise is gone. Despite this, amazing laptop.","I have had this for 3 months now. I purchased this for college and use this both in class and at home on my desk. Very thin and light weight! It is great for school because it doesn't add to the weight in my backpack. Can be easily picked up with one hand to shift papers, books around. Great size, the touch screen has actually been very useful when I have turned it around to show folks a presentation or paper and I can easily reach and scroll the screen without doing the awkward reach around to pad. Fan is very quiet. It is located at the bottom not side. I have not tested it on  bed or soft surface so I don't know how it will do nor how hot it gets in a lap. Just note, to open you do have to use both hands as it is so light weight, the bottom lifts. That was a little weird at first. The cord it small and compact but it feels a little wobbly. I haven't had any issue with it falling out but it was just something I noticed. It is almost scary thin to where I am worried I will toss a textbook or something accidentally and break it. It has been accidentally tossed while in the backpack with a text book twice now and I haven't had an issue but just something to note. Overall a great value for me and I have been happy with it so far.","We bought this as a laptop for a college age child.  I wish MY laptop was this lightweight!!  Incredible.  My child really likes it; however, there have been off and on issues with the touch screen.  Not sure if it is a loose connection or software updates have caused problems with the touch screen readability or something else entirely.  (Extensive software updates upon receiving it and Microsoft updates regularly).  We've owned the computer just over a month.  We will see how it survives college.  I would buy it again providing the touch screen continues to work.","I've been using this laptop for about 10 days and love it! I opted for the i5 model and it's super fast. The 256GB SSD is good sized and blazing fast! Boots up in about 5 seconds and is ready to go. Laptop runs cool and is silent. It only weighs 2.2 lbs which is crazy light for a 15.6\", but feels solid and sturdy. Well built for sure. I don't really care about or use the touchscreen, but it works well. The full HD IPS screen is so clear and crisp, even at angles. It's glossy but I don't see any glare issues at all. The touchpad is glassy smooth like my MB, and works perfect. The down firing speakers work fine, but do wish they were on top for better sound. The backlit keyboard and fingerprint reader are great. Typing is a pleasure and the keys work perfect. There are plenty of ports for me, and it charges up pretty quick. The battery life has been really good for such a light laptop. About 8 hours of solid use. I was looking for a fast and super light 15.6\" laptop for under $1,000 and this fits the bill. Acer has a real winner here!","Have not used it enough to guage the battery, which sometimes suffers from the lightweighting. But it's incredibly nice feel, extremely light without feeling \"cheap\". Normally I avoid the touchscreen (gimmick) in ordering laptops, didn't notice this had one because the price is so reasonable.","So far so good, way better then my old one. have a few issues like the fingerprint scanner does not work and am not sure if its a hardware or software problem and still haven't got answers on support on this. only other thing is the keyboard light is delayed and dims which i don't like and there is no setting for it to stay on all the time. Just tiny things that don't take away from me really enjoying the laptop. Smooth, no overheating and quite.","I bought this laptop for son to use for high school. It's very fast and the battery last all day which is important since he doesn't have time to charge it during school. The touch screen is nice too. I got mine as a deal of the day saving $150 on the current price posted.","Beautiful screen and only 2.2 pounds as advertised.  Also, can be charged by the supplied round plug-in charger or a 45 watt USB-C charger which is phenomenal since you can then carry one charger for the laptop and your phone .  I also have a Spin 7 & it's USB-C charger, will charge my Swift 5.  Keys could be a little wider and spaced farther apart given the size of the bottom half of the laptop.  Not as good as the Spin 7's keyboard but I prefer it to my original LG Gramm's.  Also  could require just a little more resistance to depress. Over time, I've also found that the battery for since train teens to discharge more over night and periods of non use, about 20%","Bought for my daughter and she is happy with it!","Is this the perfect computer? No. But for the price, it is an incredible value. First, it is super lightweight. Considering the screen size, it is easy to lift. Second, it packs a core i7 Intel processor in there. This is blazingly fast. Of course, the price you pay for such a thin, lightweight computer that has such a hefty processor is that the computer will get hot. This is wonderful on a cold day when you're sitting outside with the laptop on your lap. But if it's hot outside, it's no fun. But this is just physics. It's hard to pack a powerful processor in a small package and not get it to heat up. So you either accept it or get a less powerful or more heavy laptop that has more insulation and a more powerful fan. The battery life is easily 8 hours and if you put on some power saving features, then you will get 10 hours. The bezel is quite narrow. The laptop weighs less than 1 kg. It has an HDMI port. As well as two USB ports. It has a headphone jack. Also a place where you can use a Kensington lock.  I love that the keyboard is backlit. It does not have a 10-key numerical Pad, but you can turn on the num lock and have a fair imitation. Setting it up is a breeze thanks to Windows 10 and Cortana. It will take you less than 20 minutes. Acer just makes nice affordable laptops. I've had them before and I continue to be impressed with the value that they deliver. They rarely make things for power users, but if you are part of the 80% who just need a good decent laptop, then you will be quite happy with this purchase. I hope the photos are helpful.","This is the lightest-weight laptop I have ever used at about 2 pounds.  Despite its weight, it is a 15.6-inch screen laptop with a full-sized keyboard (excluding the number pad to the right side of the keyboard). The LCD is touchscreen, and below the keyboard, there is a standard touchpad and a fingerprint reader to the right side. To keep the laptop thin, some of the old ports are not build in. In most cases this will not be an issue. There are two 3.0 USB Type A ports (the end is the same shape as has been available on the computer for years) and a 3.1 USB Type C. In addition to these ports, there is an HDMI port and an audio line out. If you wish to connect, there is Bluetooth, 802.11a\/b\/g\/n\/ac WIFI. If you wish for a wired LAN connection, you will need to get a USB-to-LAN converter cable. There is not an audio line in, VGA port, or memory card reader, but those features\/legacy items are worth sacrificing for the thin profile and light weight with various work-around cables available if you need to connect these ways. The sound is good for a laptop of this size. I was concerned about the hard drive size, but out of the 256 GB-sized drive, 201 GD are available. This is not really an issue considering the focus of this laptop is for lightweight portability, not intense gaming. With a full charge, a full workday\u2019s use on battery should not be a problem. My experience is that using Microsoft Word (I installed this. The laptop doesn\u2019t come with Word.), an Internet browser and other non-video-intense applications, the battery life approaches it 9-10 hour advertised upper limit.","This is my first touchscreen laptop and didn't know what to expect. It's very thin and light weight. The screen is really amazing. Its super sharp and the colors are rich and brings new life to your images. The keyboard is backlit which is nice. The touch screen is very quick and responsive. While the screen is glossy, there feels like there's a coating on it that helps keep your fingers from sliding too quickly and also to reduce prints. One thing  i was expecting is that the screen would fold back to make this a tablet but its not that kind of laptop. The speakers are located on the bottom underneath of the laptop so if its on your lap, they get muffled. The sound is on the weak side even though it has Dolby sound. I expected more from the audio and at maxed volume, it was still low. intel core i7 processor, 500gig ssd HD and 16gb ram is enough for most people but if you are looking to do heavy video editing its not made for that. There's also a fingerprint ID kind of like the Apple products have. The cam quality i felt was just ok. One thing to note is that this laptop gets super hot and i mean hot....both on the bottom and the top. My keyboard started heating up and my legs were getting toasted. There is an internal fan but i'm not sure its strong enough to tackle the heat it puts out. Comes with lots of software like games and other unnecessary stuff which is easily deleted but for the price of this laptop it should come with free Notron, not a 30 day trial and also free MS Office not a trial also. Or at least free versions that might not have every option. It was a little frustration when setting this up and finding out that its asking you to purchase\/buy. Cortana talks you through the entire setup which was one of the easiest startups i've ever done. It only took about 15 minutes to complete. There were a few other features I needed to adjust like the trackpad. I like the old way that to scroll down you slide your finger down not the opposite. There are also a bunch of yes\/no's that you should watch out for because windows wants to share a tone of data including what sites you go to. Be careful what you agree to when starting up. The speed of this computer is fantastic, wifi was strong and fast as well. Having the touch screen really makes windows 10 much more fun to use in my opinion. The trackpad (although i dislike them) is one of the best i've used on a laptop including a MacBook. It was very accurate and really just worked like it should. Two usb 3 ports and a usb port as well. HDMI and a headphone jack. This is definitely a laptop that you don't mind traveling with because of its light weight. Its still a full size 15.6\" so its still big but after you see the amazing screen and that its so light its not a problem. My biggest complaint is that the ac adapter is way too short. If you have it on your desk you probably won't be able to reach the outlet. I have to use an extension cord with it which it ridiculous.","This review will cover the good, the bad and the downright ugly. I've bought Acer Chromebook(s) for family members since they came out and recently got a new Acer Spin for myself which I liked as much if not more than my older pro model Samsung so figured this would be a much needed update for family. I was so very wrong. First the good - this is light weight, thin and the overall display is quite nice. Set-up is a breeze. The touchpad mouse area and screen are both responsive, the fingerprint reader is weak...the one on the Spin is far better but this did the job albeit slower and more buggy. It comes loaded with some bloatware which can mostly be removed. Updates and getting everything up to speed was lightening fast. Where this fell apart was turning on the narration for use with disabled\/elderly. Talk about a nightmare. Thankfully I always set up everything before handing it over because even with vision, it was confusing and ended up locking. The lag time when using touch was so bad that it would leave the user searching while giving a description several second later.....or not at all. Sometimes it would simply skip ahead. Other times it locked entirely - I'm talking locking the entire computer to the point a full reboot had to take place. Since my entire objective was to ready this for use by someone in need of robust narration and full functionality it was a supreme disappointment however, for the majority of users, this provide ample access to online shopping, games and other apps. The sound is clear, the voice options nice as users can select speed, intonation and other features but the lag while in use is entirely unacceptable. Bottom line- good option for average user(s). Terrible for those requiring narration and advanced accessibility support.","This 15in laptop comes with i7, 16G ram, 512 SSD. That's plenty fast for the typical user. Acer has good build quality and a solid feel. Overall great laptop with a few room for improvements. Pros: - Computer response is fast and snappy. but most computer is like that brand new. - Display is bright and sharp. - It's lightweight at a little over 2lbs - Fingerprint sensor is pretty consistent and accurate. - Runs silent - There's slight foam padding around the bezel to prevent slamming shut when closing the lid. Closes with a soft thump. - Battery life lasts long. Cons: - No dedicated number pad even for a 15.5\" - Finger does not glide smoothly on the screen. It rubs. - Difficult to open the lid. No tabs or lip for fingers to pry open with - Speakers located under the laptop facing down which muffles sound - Screen angle is limited before the rear edge hits the table top, after that point it starts to lift the back end of the laptop","This is a full 15 inch laptop and when you first pick it up, you won't believe it! Shockingly light, easy to hold with one hand.  This is VERY light for the size, heck, its light for any size! Its way lighter than my 13 inch lenovo yoga 730, which is 2.6 lbs....you can feel the difference! It still feels solid.  Screen is bright and punchy.  Keyboard is good, fingerprint reader is also very reliable for me so far (better than the yoga 730 for sure). It has a usb-c port, but no thunderbolt 3 which is a shame.  But at least you can CHARGE the laptop with a 45 watt usb-c charger, which is a huge bonus if you don't want to carry the small power brick with you everywhere. I do think it is a bit limited on the overall number of ports--everything is on the left side aside from the headphone jack...another usb-a or c port on the other side would have been very nice. This is a laptop that I believe has memory soldered on the board, so upgrades are more limited.  And the light nature of the build means....the speakers are pretty bad.  I have a few other laptops and everything is much louder...even if this is maxxed out.  So if you must listen with this--get headphones or external speakers. There is no active pen support....but for travel this should be a quite fine machine. I have not had a chance to test the battery life, but initial tests seem like it should last a full day under typical use. I don't know why they didn't include a num pad for a laptop of this side, but otherwise keyboard has nice travel and spacing. If you want a 15 inch in a nice travel package, this is a great deal.  I do believe the LG gram series is a bit better in terms of overall quality, but they tend to start at a much higher price point.  But the 15 inch model does have thunderbolt 3 and more internal upgrade options...so weigh in that once you make your decision.","I really have no words, this was a breeze to set up after I shut Cortana up (sorry, she drives me nuts). The laptop is super fast, great to use to stream TV shows. The visual display is awesome and very clear and bright. The battery last a long time, it was several hours watching Saturday westerns before he asked for a charge. I like the touchscreen, but the previous two laptops I've owned didn't have that, and I have become used to the trackpad (which works great and is very responsive). The coolest thing is how lightweight it is, before I took it home I asked a coworker to pick it up and he was quite surprised. Note: I see comments in the other reviews that the battery burns very hot - I have not had similar results at all. In 24 hours it has been on my lap, on the arm of the chair and on top of a pillow on my lap and not hot at all. I couldn't be happier, plus the keyboard is great and from an old school typist like me, that's a plus.","This laptop is LIGHT.  I almost thought they forgot to put the laptop in the box when I went to open it, it was very deceiving. The sheer lightness of it makes me somewhat leery about potential damage, however I think most of that will can be mitigated with proper handling. Powering on and setting up was extremely easy. I think it took maybe 15 minutes from start to finish? The keys are responsive and have a nice back-lighting that isn't overpowered and isn't harsh on the eyes. The touch mouse pad is decent, although it tends to do something other than what I intended it to do. That may be just me, so I can't be to critical. I do prefer a physical mouse instead of track pads when it comes to computers and it's very easy to add one of your own; I highly recommend it. The touch screen is very nice, and as long as your hands are clean it doesn't retain too much in the way of fingerprints. The screen does feel 'bumpy' to me, I noticed it when playing a simple game of solitaire and i'm not sure if that is a byproduct of having a touch sensitive screen or not. The screen is responsive and fairly quick at registering my touches, and appears to be on point for where I point. Boot up speed is great, from power button press to log in feels like less than a minute. I am primarily using this computer for light duty work away from home, and for troubleshooting\/ testing my 3d printers. It helps to be next to the printer monitoring whats going on and making changes as necessary. I don't think I would load this computer up with anything intensive like Adobe, I'm not sure its best suited to that. The battery life seems to last forever. I just recently had to plug it in to recharge, it feels like I haven't done that since its arrival. Sound is so so. You can really only do so much with such a small platform but they did a decent job. Overall this laptop has been a stellar replacement for my aging laptop it replaced.","The Acer Swift 5 Thin & Lightweight Laptop is a nice product. Here are the pros and cons. Pros: - Lightweight - Solid build quality despite its thin profile - Powerful, speedy processor - Backlit keyboard - Pretty good battery life. Not up to 10hrs as claimed but about half with moderate use. - Quick, responsive touchscreen - Colorful, sharp display Cons: - The AC adapter cable is too short - No dedicated number pad - Comes with lots of bloatware - Terrible audio. Sound out of the speakers are tinny, low, and lack bass. Good sound through the headphones though. - The speakers are located at the bottom of the laptop which tends to muffle the already lackluster audio coming from this product - The display is nice but not as bright as the previous Acer laptop that I own - Can't upgrade the hard drive to get more storage - I wish there were more ports. Only 2 USB, 1 HDMI and 1 USB Type-C port. There's actually enough room on the other side of the laptop to fit more ports. Even with the annoying cons, I still really like this computer. The lightweight, portability and fast processor makes this a worthy purchase. As an everyday driver, this laptop does not disappoint.","When I first got this I thought that it would be just another great lap top, but then I discovered there is a touch screen and I really perked up.  I never really liked the small touch module where you push your finger around to get to places on the screen.  Then, not realizing that this was a touch screen, I happened to  try and move the cursor a little bit lower and then found the touch feature! This is a very nice  lightweight laptop as I have had others which are bulky and clumsy as the weight is too much.  This is easy to hold when you are sitting in a comfortable chair and want to have other things to do like be in front of you TV and search out somethings which happen to pop up. This fits nicely into the carrier that I have and is not at all uncomfortable to carry with you. I highly like the speed and the storage as well.  This is a great addition to your electronic needs and I highly recommend it!"],"4":["To give some context, I'm a 10+ year Apple laptop user that wanted to make the jump to a Chromebook a couple months ago. Everyone was raving about the Asus434, so I went for it. Since then I went through two more of the same laptop because of issues. The experience was so frustrating, and I was about to totally give up. Until out of nowhere Asus drops the C425. A lot of this review will compare the two since that was my experience. After handling the Asus434 and the aluminum build, it feels like the C425 doesn't have that. I could be wrong, but it feels somewhat plastic (and maybe it is). It still looks clean, but I noticed the difference. The screen on the C425 looks great. I don't know the specs on whether it is the same setup as the 434 (which looks amazing), but it's really nice. There's a thin black frame on the screen that I really appreciate. Having also tried out the HP x360 Chromebook, I appreciate the way Asus tries to maximize the screen without putting a thicker black frame with their logo on it. The biggest wins for me with this computer (after only a few days of having it) is that I haven't had the screen flicker randomly (which happened all the time with the 434). And probably the most important part for me is that the selling price is more reasonable (in my opinion) than what the 434 (8-gig) was\/is. For a Chromebook that expensive it should handle a lot better than what it was. I will also say it's slightly lighter than the 434, which I'm a fan of. Lastly, I thought that losing the 2-in-1 feature and touchscreen would be a deal breaker, but so far it's been fine. Like anything, I guess you gotta know what you want the computer for and when you'll actually be using it. They may be deal breakers for you, but it also might be giving it a test drive to see if you can live without it. So far, after two months of frustration and research, I think I've landed on the Chromebook for me.","I bought this computer because I believed that the only differences with the C434 were that this is a clamshell (no hinges), that it has more RAM and that it doesn't have touch screen. I could live with those differences. But there is another one that Asus does not advertise: the c434 is full aluminium and this is half plastic. The bottom half of the computer is made of cheap plastic instead of aluminium. I didn't want to buy a cheap plastic computer, not at least at this price point. P.S. After a couple of weeks I can add: 1. At 399 the half plastic design is more understandable (but It cost me a lot more so I am keeping my rating). 2. Everythings works fine save for the Wi-fi. Many times my computer can't connect to the internet while my phone does. So the quality here is not so good either","Just bought a couple days ago.  The Touchscreen feature being omitted didn't bother me as well as the 360 fold flat feature on the C434.  These were items I could live without. What was the primary decision was the 8gb processor which makes surfing the web and such quick and lag free.  Very pleased so far.","I recently decided to step into the Chromebook world since I wanted something between my Fire tablet and my gaming laptop that I could quickly grab when I needed to do things online. I see a lot of reviews comparing this to the Asus C434, but since I've never used one of those I can't make a comparison. I briefly used a cheaper Asus Chromebook (C423), but the display on that was so bad it prompted me to return it for this model. The C423 had washed out colors, a lower resolution, and terrible viewing angles. This display has none of those issues. Colors a good and viewing angles are comfortable regardless of the angle you have the hinge open to. The Core m3 and 8GB of RAM may be overkill since I'm mainly using this for the web browser and watching movies, but coming from a gaming laptop I'd rather have the extra power and not need it than vice versa. All that plus the baklit keyboard makes this everything that I was looking for in a Chromebook. My only criticism is that the bottom of the Chromebook gets somewhat warm while charging, and VERY warm whenever I'm watching videos. There are no fans on this thing to cool it, so if your intention is to set this on your lap and watch videos you'll want one of those laptop cooling pads to set it on or it will get uncomfortable.","General impression is good for the price I bought this for ($399 on sale). However, if it is priced at the MSRP of $500 I'd consider the C434 more strongly. I went into this purchase wanting 8 gb RAM and not needing a touch screen so this device fit my needs for a lower price. Construction: Very solid, despite it being a plastic body (not aluminum like C434). Good fit and finish. Design is very attractive. Keyboard: Sturdy keys with good amount of travel and feel. Track pad: Surface area is large. Material is plastic and not as smooth as glass versions so I would advise using a mouse for extended use (which I was planning to do anyway). Sound: Won't blow your mind, but volume is loud and satisfying. Speakers face down underneath device. Screen: Narrow bezels are great. Matte surface with minimal glare. Images of are generally good quality,  but I've certainly seen displays with better color and sharpness. Non-touch display. Performance: Very good for my casual use which includes streaming one HD movie with a browser running 3-4 tabs for work. I think this device can handle much more since it has 8 gb RAM. Noise: No fan, completely silent.","The specs on this chromebook are amazing, so I bought one.  I had trouble viewing the keyboard, especially with the backlighting on as other reviewers have noted. The characters on the keys are cutouts, like a face carved in a Halloween pumpkin, so there is no contrast in a non-dark room when the backlight is on. You can't read the keyboard! If you turn the backlight off, every little ray of ambient light that reflects on the keyboard also kills the contrast and makes it unreadable. It's awful. Had I used the C425 for a minute in a store, that would have been a deal-buster. However, I tried to work past that by taking it with me to my usual locations where i work. The long and short of it is that the C425 does a poor job of pulling in WIFI connections. With my old HP chromebook, I had no such troubles at the exact same locations where the C425 can't find a connection. I *REALLY* wanted to love the C425 but that was a  deal-buster. I packed it up and sent it back.  I see from the comments above that others have experienced the poor WIFI reception, too, so I suspect it's a design\/construction flaw, not a problem with my particular unit. Sigh...","There are lots of great articles and videos online that give overviews about the technical differences between a PC and a Chromebook. I wanted to avoid technical jargon and break it down for the average joe. Keep in mind that this is a mid-range price point for a Chromebook, so there will be tradeoffs. Overall, the Asus Chromebook C425 is a unique find when it comes to the Chromebook market. Usually at this pricepoint, you see more aesthetic features (slim profile, touch screen, 360 flip) and less computing power. However, this is actually the opposite. With this model, you are getting better computing power  (needed for large applications like video editing, data computation, etc), with not as many aesthetic features. If you want a Chromebook with more computing power, this is a great option at a great price. If you are looking for something more stylish and flashy, there are alternative Chromebooks on the market around the same price point as well. Auto Update Expiration Date: With Chromebooks, you don\u2019t get updates forever (like a phone). Updates will stop being pushed out to your chromebook based on when it is released, not purchased. The Auto Update Expiration for this particular Chromebook is June 2024. Set-up: If setting up a new computer stresses you out, you will love this. It\u2019s as simple as unboxing, powering on, and creating or logging into an existing google account. After a few automatic updates, this was ready to go within 3-4 minutes. A few demo videos pop up to walk you through the different features, so you can just sit back and relax. Start Up\/Opening apps: Starting up the laptop from sleep or powering on only took a few seconds. It keeps up with a lot of modern tech. From startup it took about 3 seconds. From sleep it only took 1.5 seconds. Opening apps took just over 1 second. Look\/Feel: This Chromebook has a very generic aesthetic. The top is aluminum, while the bottom is plastic. It is comparable to many department store laptops. This has a slim profile, but it\u2019s on the thicker end of Chromebooks with slim profiles.  Overall, it looks modern and new but it isn\u2019t going to impress anyone with its appearance. Screen: The screen resolution is typical for the price point. This has a matte finish over the screen, which is great for reducing glare. The screen has the typical 1920 x 1080 resolution. I would describe the resolution as clear, but not crisp. The thin bezel (border) makes the screen look large and impressive. It is comparable to most screens out today. Sound: This has a nice sound quality and clarity. At maximum volume, this can fill a small room but sounds quiet in a mid-sized room. The speakers are on the bottom sides of the Chromebook. Sounds even better when using headphones. Keyboard: The keyboard layout is slightly different than laptops, which to me is the biggest day to day difference in owning a Chromebook. Most of the top row keys (\u201cF\u201d keys) have been replaced with quick function keys that turn up the brightness, volume, etc. The CAPS lock has been replaced with a key that launches a search menu. If you prefer the CAPS lock key, you can go to the settings and change the function of the keys. It\u2019s simple to do. The backlit keyboard looks very sharp. It has a beautiful luminosity in the dark. However, I find the letters on each key difficult to read during the day when they are lit up via the backlight since they are clear. You can change the backlighting by holding alt + screen brightness button up or down. It is a bit annoying to toggle back and forth depending on what lighting you are in, but it\u2019s not a deal breaker. Battery: I got on average about 10-11 hours of use between web surfing, streaming, working on documents, etc. Streaming: I have subscriptions to 4 or 5 of the most popular streaming services. I had no issues with buffering or delayed loading times. Once I clicked a video or movie, it streamed all the way through with no problems or lagging. Of course this is also dependent on the internet connection you are using. Web Browsing: I surfed the web on the Chrome browser that is already installed and had no issues or crashes. I could have more than 10 tabs open at once, and it was still lightning fast. Documents,Spreadsheets, Slides, etc: Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides all come preloaded on the Chromebook and are free to use. They are compatible with all of my existing documents and spreadsheets. I am able to use these apps offline too, which is great for traveling or working outside. I use these apps for  writing papers, keeping simple spreadsheets, and presentations. Nothing that requires a high computing power. This is definitely all that is needed for average people and students. Experience Switching from a PC to a Chromebook: I recently switched from PCs to Chromebooks. I was afraid that I would regret the decision, but haven\u2019t looked back. I felt I had a full grasp of the operating system and functionality within 24 hours. For the average Joe, Chromebooks are a great option. Problems: I haven\u2019t had any problems with this Chromebook. I will be sure to update my review if I experience any issues with hardware, crashing, etc.","No complaints. I don't mind the plastic bottom. It won't scratch any wooden surfaces. With 8 GB RAM the ASUS C425 replaced my old Acer R11 Chromebook and it is much faster. Actually its faster than that my Acer Windows 10 laptop with  16 GB of RAM.","I purchased this from Amazon just a few weeks ago. It replaced an Asus Chromebook C423NA, which was my first foray into Chromebook (June 2019). That earlier Chromebook was good... but because I rely on a few key Linux programs (including a GIS heavyweight, QGIS) it wasn't keeping up. And a few Android apps that I rely on were not running fast enough (i.e., Evernote). Also the screen was so-so, with a lower resolution. Then I saw this C425 on sale at Amazon. Twice the RAM, much better screen (1080), better processor. And that has made all the difference! This Chromebook is amazing for the price. Everything works so much better and looks so much better on this Chromebook! Then you add the backlit keyboard and it makes it a winner. My only complaint is the rather cludgy power supply: it is the same size as the C423NA, but with a much thicker cord from the power supply to the Chromebook AND a very thick ~30\" 3-prong power cord. Don't know why they did that. Fortunately, it still tucks away in a slim laptop bag that I got. That is why I couldn't give it a 5 star rating. - Battery life is very good (8-10 hours) - Performance is very good. Obviously, this is not for heavy-duty gaming.... but it handles everything else very well. - The screen is not a touchscreen, but that's not a problem for me, as I'm a touch typist. I have an Asus Windows 10 laptop with a touchscreen and I rarely use the touchscreen on that device. Other than that, the screen is clear and bright, with good color rendering. I prefer its matte glass finish over shiny. Bottom line: this Chromebook is even better than expected! I HIGHLY recommend it!","It was time to upgrade from my 6 year old Acer C720, and I chose the ASUS C425 because: 14\" screen on a 13\" body Under 3lbs 8GB RAM Decent processor Tiny USB-C power brick that can plug in on either side of the unit Good battery life Lighted keyboard I've had it for a week now and love it! It fits great inside the Egiant 13.3\" laptop sleeve https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B01N636T7M which has plenty of room for the power brick, low profile Bluetooth mouse, a mouse pad, and a few odds and ends besides.  This Chromebook has paired flawlessly with my phone and the mouse, and I've had no issues getting it on WiFi at home or at work.  I can't say I'm impressed with the camera, but I don't do video calling or anything, so it's a non-issue for me. I've used Chrome Remote Desktop to connect to my home and work PC's on it, and been very happy with the performance. The Google Assistant has been handy to have on it, as are some of the Android apps. I would definitely recommend the C425 to anyone upgrading or even for a first Chromebook.","GOOD - screen is high quality - keyboard feels solid - backlit keyboard BAD - case is plastic, and feels very cheap. probably scratches easy. - backlight on keyboard does not appear uniform across keys (the ctrl key has a super illuminated TRL, but a dark C.). white light leaks through from most angles, suggesting this was a last minute add-on, and not well reviewed - screen blacks out randomly, during use. obviously buggy, so we swapped it out for another exact same product via amazon. - the replacement we received doesn't even power up. it doesn't show indications of charging. it doesn't turn on (what the heck, guys!) FINAL VERDICT: - we will return both pieces of hardware. might consider spending the extra dollars towards a macbook air for a piece of reliable hardware. - stay away until the next version of this thing comes out. I should have known not to be the first to buy this","I have purchased Macbooks since 2005 but after the last round of price increases at Apple, I decided that I was going to break out of Apple lockdown prison and try a new ecosystem. Though it took a week or so to adjust, I am so happy did. Though I still have a 2016 Macbook Pro, that costs four times as much, I find myself using it less and less. The screen on the C425 is larger than the 13\" MBP and though not as densely populated with pixels nor as nit endowed, I don't find it lacking in anyway. In fact the bezels are smaller on the C425's matte screen, and I didn't realize how much I missed the softer glow of the matte as opposed to the ubiquitous glossy that Apple dictated we should all embrace. In my experience the battery life of the C425 is better than the MBP. The computer is blazingly fast (the intel core M3 is way more powerful than required to run Chrom OS). I also appreciate that it has 8 GB of RAM and 64 GB or solid state storage. The best part about this machine is that I can bring it to a cafe downtown and not be constantly stressed about some ill-intentioned character making off with $1600 of my hard earned money. In fact since I am always surrounded by Apple laptops I am almost sure that I would be the last person targeted. My only niggles are that the track pad has occasionally gotten stuck in the engaged position (not sure if this is a software or hardware issue).","There are cheap crepe Chromebooks practically for free and there are pricey Chromebooks that make you get a cheaper Windows PC instead.  What is desperately needed is that mid-range wonder that is cheaper than most PCs but better than any cheap crepe laptop. You've found it.  Great screen, great keyboard, 8GB of RAM, 64GBs of storage, a fanless zippy Core M3 chip -- NICE SPECS for $379.  (Around Black Friday it's been at a STEAL ME price.)  There's a fancier C425 from Asus but unless someone really needs 2 in 1 flippity floppity -- -- your search is over.  If you're a parent with kids instead of them sharing a nicer Chromebook get two of these maybe.  Yes, it has a plastic bottom, but it's not junk plastic.  Since I don't have kids my cat Corteo (see picture) is perfectly pleased with it.","Surprisingly excellent keyboard (better feel than laptops costing multiples), reasonable screen (excellent dimensions, just not class-leading clarity), and great CPU and RAM. There have been some reviews of plasticky feel etc but for the price it's great--the typing feel\/density is excellent. Also you can run Crostini. What's not like to like?","Out of the box my new chrome book said Chrome OS was missing or damaged. Amazon support was of no help so the item is going back and I wasn\u2019t even given the option of a replacement. Won\u2019t be ordering this again.","QC isn't where it needs to be.  The first one I got shipped without ChromeOS and powered on to error screen.  The second one I received has a blown left speaker that makes raspy rattling noise even at medium volume.  The down arrow key also fell off.  Everyone probably says this, but I baby this laptop and it is only a couple months old.  My Chromebook expectations are set at reasonable level given the price point, but this is really disappointing. I like the hefty, long power cable, battery life, screen, and performance.","After many (many) years of fighting with Windows, I decided to get a Chromebook.  So far, it works brilliantly.  No more waiting for Windows 10 to boot, or finish doing whatever it's doing in the background,  or try to sell me Office once again, or download and install another huge update, which it seemed to reliably insist on doing every 3rd time I turned it on. Now I just flip up the screen and in a couple of seconds, Chrome is there, running at full speed.","I needed a larger screen replacement for an older 12\" chromebook and this one was a good option. - m3 CPU, 8GB RAM, and 14\" screen The build quality is nice, the matte screen easy on the eyes, and the speakers loud enough for general use. I would buy this unit again.","I've had it for two months.  I use it for browser based document work more than other things (infrequent video streaming, zero gaming). In any work session over two hours, there will be a crash where everything goes black and the system restarts. In fairness, I've never lost any work, but this is stupid and annoying. If I leave the machine plugged in and logged in for several hours, it's usually frozen when I come back. Tellingly, one of the only two FAQs for this model at the ASUS support site is titled \"How to reset the crashed\/no display Chromebook?\". I'll update this review if I get a resolution from ASUS support.","I am an online retail seller and am doing a lot of Amazon, eBay, other graphic intensive websites, Google sheet, and analysis APP work. Before I purchased this, I used an Asus 4 GB chromebook. I did not quite understand why computer response was so slow at times. I even upgraded internet service. But this model (8 GB capability) made all the difference. It is now lightening fast. It looks sleek and light weight.","A bargain model that can be used with confidence through Auto Update until 2026. It works really longtime when keyboard Backlit is off.","Small, fast, long battery life","The battery lasts. Depending on use, I charge it every other day, sometimes less often. It's light. I can carry all day in my backpack and my neck and shoulders don't bother me.","have not had this computer long enough to learn everything I need to know. This is my first \"chromebook\" . still learning","Fantastic computer, but could you use less plastic and use materials with better quality for keyboard, touchpad...","Amazing product.","No touch screen. Great laptop. Great upgrade over my 6.5 year old chromebook. Runs citrix super fast.","The Asus C425 is a fast, well built 14\" Chromebook and worth considering if you are looking for a highly portable laptop with long battery life for everyday use. The C425 would be a great choice for students who use the Google Drive ecosystem to complete their homework and communicate with instructors. It would be a good first laptop for users intimidated by Windows 10 or Mac operating systems. And it is an inexpensive basic laptop for travelers who may want to leave their more expensive ones at home. Chromebooks in general have their limitations, but for general use they are wonderful. Chromebooks do not have CD\/DVD drives nor can you add software not found in the Google Webstore. But if you want to enjoy web surfing, email, social media, Netflix or basic office tasks, a Chromebook is probably enough for you. The Asus Chromebook C425 is an everyday workhorse that runs on WiFi and web-based apps, but it's also a great choice for entertainment. While not perfect, it's a very good choice that most users will appreciate. ------------------------------------------ \ud83d\udccc Out of the Box: There's not a lot to it. The C425 Chromebook, the power supply, and very little documentation. You plug it in to charge it and push the power button to get started. If you don't already have a Gmail account, you may want to consider setting it up before you fire up this Chromebook as it runs using the Chrome operating system and syncs with your Google account (if desired).  You can also log in as a guest, but you won't reap all the benefits if you do it that way. You will also want to have your WiFi password handy as this Chromebook connects wirelessly. It does not have an Ethernet (wired) port. Once logged in and connected via Wifi, the Chromebook will automatically update itself.  It will do this in the background whenever you are connected to the internet.  This updates the operating system and integrated security features. ------------------------------- \ud83d\udee0 Build-Quality, Features & Perks: The Asus C425 is one of the best-built Chromebooks I've ever used. The chassis has virtually no flex, despite being made of plastic that looks like brushed metal.  The keyboard, which is backlit, is great to type on and feels very much like my desktop keyboard - which I like. The backlit keyboard has 1.44mm of travel, which felt very much like my desktop keyboard and I liked that!  Having backlighting on a keyboard should be standard, but it's not, so this was a much-appreciated feature to find on this Chromebook. I did think the color of the writing on the keys was so subtle that in daylight they were a little tough to read, but if you are a touch typist like me, that won't be an issue. And when backlit, it's a non-issue for everyone. The 14\" 1080P HD matte-screen looks good from all angles. It doesn't wash out if you sit to the side and it's plenty bright at full brightness, but can easily be adjusted for viewing comfort. Night Mode allows for those who find looking at a monitor all day strains their eyes, a break from the blue light. The bezel around the screen is about 1\/4\" wide, making the display appear a bit larger than expected. The sound from the two downward-facing speakers on the bottom of the laptop are pretty good. I enjoyed hours of Netflix viewing and never wished I'd used my earphones instead. When I tried using my Bluetooth connected earbuds the sound was OK, but I actually preferred not using them as the sound from the onboard speakers seemed to have more depth of sound than my earbuds which surprised me. Battery life is estimated to be up to 12 hours for the C425.  I found it was just over 10 hours for my first use, but I still had a little juice left and probably would have gotten 11 if I'd turned down the brightness and stopped watching videos.  Depending upon how you use it and what processes are going on, you can probably eke out 12 hours from this battery which is warrantied for 1 year through Asus.  This Chromebook comes with a 1-year International warranty through Asus. A nice surprise was the inclusion of a microSD card slot. This allows users to add a card (not included) and expand their onboard storage space for photos, documents, music, and movies without connecting an external USB drive or using up cloud-based storage space. This Chromebook comes with apps installed and there are more in the Google Web Store. YouTube's app was already installed, but I added Pluto TV and Netflix right away as I'm a cord cutter (no cable TV) who uses streaming media services to supplement my over-the-air TV viewing.  Pluto TV is free and worked very well, as did Netflix and YouTube. I have high-speed internet that runs up to almost 100Gbps, so streaming media is no problem for me even with multiple devices on my home network. I found that the C425 ran flawlessly without dropped Wifi signals and watching streaming media a joy with this Chromebook. The C425 has a great combination of 8GB of RAM (memory) and a 64GB (flash) drive.  The combination of hardware and the Chrome operating system work well in this Chromebook.  It's got zippy performance and seemed stable as I moved swiftly through various applications. This is not a touchscreen laptop. For me, that's not a big deal. It does lay flat if you want it to, but without the touchscreen, I really don't see the point. Google Drive is the backbone of the Chromebook. It's perfect for students, home users and some business professionals, and it's free to use. There are also free apps for Microsoft Office products in the Web store if desired, and Google Drive can open and work with formats used with Microsoft software. You can save documents for offline viewing and editing too, so you don't always have to be connected to Wifi. You get 12 months of 100GB of FREE storage space on the Google One cloud with the purchase of this Chromebook. That becomes 15GB free after the first year or you can pay two dollars a month for the original 100GB.  You can get a little break on that price if you pre-pay for a year at a time.  For three bucks a month you can get two hundred GB a year and again, a little price break for prepaying. -------------------------------------- \ud83e\udd28 What could be better about the C425: The webcam is awful.  Only 0.9 MP produces grainy looking video at 720P, particularly in low light conditions and the still photos lack clarity as well. While I don't use webcams very often, it's nice to have one that's decent. This Chromebook requires an external (USB driven) one if you want clarity in your photos and video. The chassis being all plastic isn't a big deal to me as it's not cheap plastic that easily bends, but for some, this will be an issue. The lack of an HDMI port is puzzling. I worked around it by getting a USB-C to HDMI dongle. I guess there had to be a shortcut or two somewhere and this made this list.  Only one USB-A port is also somewhat limiting, but again, a hub for more ports is possible. ------------------------------------------- \ud83d\ude0e It's not perfect, but I like it a lot and recommend it to others! Overall, I really like this Chromebook and I'm impressed with its performance and build quality. The C425 hits a sweet spot between rock-bottom, barebones Chromebooks and all the bells and whistles. While it lacks a good webcam, an HDMI port, and a touchscreen, it provides users with a very lightweight mobile office and entertainment laptop with storage expansion, a good display, and sound. ----------------------------------------------------","Not bad for the price","I was skeptical about the usefulness of Chromebooks. As an IT specialist, in my mind, Chromebooks were relegated to Classroom settings as I perceived them as a strictly google account-linked, cloud based Web Browser\/Word Processor. In a sense, they still serve this purpose primarily but they can also do much more than that. This model is going to be compared to the ASUS Chromebook 434 as they are similar in a lot of ways, but also have noticeable, and for some, deal-breaking differences. Unlike the 434, the chassis for this laptop isn't made entirely out of aluminum. Instead, only the top half is, not including the hinge covers. Everything else is made out of plastic, including the touch pad, which ideally should be made out of glass. I'll talk more about the touch pad later. It's not subpar plastic, but this notebook would be made so much better if it was made entirely out of aluminum like the 434 is. The 434 has a touch screen--this does not. This could be a deal-breaker for a lot of people, as Chromebooks have access to the Google Play store, which is primarily designed around touch screen phones, so not having a touch screen breaks or limits a lot of functionality with Play Store apps. It also does not fold completely around into a \"tablet\" mode--the farthest it can go is to lie flat (180 degrees) as I've shown in the picture. When I was lying in bed watching videos, I really wanted to flip this thing completely around and hold it in a tablet-style mode, despite my original thinking before I used it that it wouldn't bother me so much. The last difference is the brightness of the screen. The 434 is almost twice as bright, however the screen is still very usable and quite good being a 1080p IPS display which incorporates anti-glare that the 434 does not. The keyboard is a highlight of this notebook. Key travel is nice and you get a solid feel of each key every time you press down on them. It's very easy to type, though from certain angles in the daytime, it's hard to see the letters on the keyboard unless you're staring straight down on it. Once you get used to the layout this isn't really a problem though. The touchpad is large and has multi-gesture support, so you can easily scroll by dragging down or up. It's not very accurate though--it feels like a chore sometimes to use the touch pad, and given that the one type USB-A port is on the left side of the laptop, I recommend sticking a wireless receiver in that port and buying a wireless mouse if you plan on traveling with it. I also recommend buying a carrying bag for it. Despite it advertising as a 14'' notebook, it actually measures 13'' across due to the thin bezels (\"nano edge\" as Asus calls it) around the screen, so a 13'' notebook bag will be ideal. Instead of having F1-12 keys and a Function key like you'd see on Windows laptops for controlling things like screen brightness and so on, this notebook has a Back button, a Forward button (identical to clicking on the back or forward button on a web browser), a page refresh button (identical to F5 on a windows keyboard), a full screen button (identical to F11 on a windows keyboard), a task view button (not sure what it's actually called in Chrome OS but it's  identical to task view in windows 10), screen brightness down and up buttons, volume up and down, and a power button. Each of these keys can be pressed without having to hold down any kind of \"function\" key. Additionally, when holding the power button, you can select to Power Off, Lock, or Log out. Powering off the notebook is as simple as holding it down for a few seconds until it goes black. There's no waiting for \"shutting down\" like you'd get on a windows machine. Onto the OS itself, this was the most alien part about it for me, but it's actually incredibly simple and easy to manage. There's a \"start\" menu, which allows you to look at your apps, search for anything on the laptop including OS settings, or do web searches. There's a taskbar, where you can \"pin\" apps, similar to Mac OS, the home bar of an iOS device, or even the windows task bar. On the bottom right, there's a visual indicator for notifications, wifi signal strength, battery life, and the time. Clicking on this brings up an additional menu where you can software turn off, lock, or log out of the laptop, access the settings, turn the wifi\/bluetooth on or off, access the nightlight, brightness etc... The settings of the OS is like an expanded version of the settings you would use in a Chrome browser, that is to say it's very easy to manage even for someone not computer-savvy. The ease of use with this makes Chromebooks ideal for a child's first computer, given that it is much more secure from a virus\/malware perspective and a lot easier to use, yet for someone as fluent with computers as myself, it's also a great tool for me as it's become my go-to notebook for work, especially when traveling due to how lightweight it is (2.9 lbs!). Since it has the ability to use Microsoft RDP or VPNs, I can easily remote into my work computer or connect to my work network to do work-related tasks. The speaker quality is sub-par, but usable. For some reason they put the speakers underneath the laptop (I've attached a picture for the location), whereas they would have been much better placed on top. This does have bluetooth though, so I recommend headphones for any kind of task where audio is important; but for simple video watching in bed or something the speakers do a sufficient job. One of the great things about Chromebooks in general, specifically this one, is how incredibly snappy and responsive this is. Aside from using flash storage, the Chrome OS is incredibly lightweight and doesn't have a lot of the overhead that a Windows OS does, so you don't need a ton of powerful hardware to have a fast computer. However, this notebook has a core m3 8th gen processor (comparable to an 8th gen i3 processor in terms of performance) and 8 gigs of RAM. To me, this is overkill, but it also allows for having a lot of tabs of Chrome open and applications running in the background without slowing the laptop down. The processor is so quick in Chrome OS that clicking on Chrome opens the web browser in a literal blink of an eye--and I'm not being hyperbolic. It opens Chrome faster than my gaming laptop does which has an i7 processor and 16 gigs of RAM. Booting up and shutting down takes only a matter of seconds. I use this for work, but it's also a good entertainment machine. It runs youtube videos flawlessly, has apps for video streaming platforms like Netflix and social media like Facebook, and can run anything in a web-based mode that Chrome could do on a windows machine. Documents and apps can be stored locally, but it's recommended that you utilize the Google cloud feature as this comes with a 100gig 1 year trial. If local storage is your thing, and you start to run out of space on the internal flash storage, it does have an SD slot to expand storage. Speaking of the ports, there is one USB-A port and two USB-C ports, which are highly versatile ports which can be used for a multitude of features when compared to USB-A. Besides the one USB-A, two USB-C, there is also one micro SD storage slot and a multi-purpose headphone\/mic 3.5mm port if you desire to plug in some headphones and\/or a mic and don't want to use bluetooth. USB-C has a much faster transfer rate and can even output to monitors. USB-C is also how the notebook charges. The USB-C ports are located on each side of the notebook which is a very thoughtful placement. The charger itself can separate. This is either good or bad for you. Typical laptop and even Chromebook chargers have the brick with the 3 prongs sticking out. This makes it a bit harder to fit inside a standard power strip especially if you have other things plugged into it. With this design, it has the usual small 3 prong end which can easily fit and not interfere with other devices plugged into the strip while the other end connects into the brick. See the picture for reference. Besides just being a web browser \/ word processor \/ application device, current versions of Chrome OS let you install a Linux virtual machine onto it, though it is currently in Beta as of this review (9\/19\/19). Having Linux, thus terminal, greatly expands the functionality of this notebook as now you can run Linux applications directly on the notebook using virtualization technology. I was able to install and use the Linux version of Visual Studio Code with no issues, though I haven't tested more applications. Note that you do need some basic knowledge of terminal commands in order to install the applications, but if you do a quick YouTube search can take care of this for you as it's incredibly easy and only takes a few minutes. In summation, I'm very satisfied with this notebook. There are some flaws that keep it from being great, such as a lack of a touch screen, lack of a 360 degree hinge to fold it all the way back, and a plastic base, but it makes up for it by being a good price point (anything $399 and under is a good deal) with very good hardware for a Chromebook. If these flaws are a deal-breaker for you, I'd recommend looking at the C434 or the upcoming C433. They are more expensive when you compare hardware-to-hardware, as the base 434 only comes with 4GB of RAM, although you can pay extra for an 8GB version; but for those who can't live without a touch screen or a 360 degree fold, I would hold off on getting this laptop and investing a little extra into one of the other models.","If that matters to you. It does offer double the RAM. I'm still thinking about it.","For what this is, its actually amazing. If you want basically a web access machine to use with websites and emails, this is the best type of system you can get. Lightweight, boots in seconds and fast. I could see myself going for this 90% to 95% of the time instead of my full laptop as 90%  give or take of the things I do Is web based. I occasionally make word documents, but I can use google docs for that. Ultimately this is also fantastic for an older person who just wants to go on the web and check emails. Showed it to my mom who is getting way up there in age and she loved it. She found it so easy to use and loved how quick it was. The only thing I wish this had was a larger main storage drive, but thats not a deal breaker. it has a micro sd slot if you need more. Screen is sharp and clear. not as bright as I am used to , but bright enough. Sound is good overall from the speakers. Great machine.","This was my first experience with a chrome book(think your phone but a laptop format).  While it cant replace my work laptop it is good for light duties or when everything i want to do can be accessed through the web or gmail interface, (it more replaces my phone when I need a larger screen or when a physical keyboard\/mouse could help) . I have a monster laptop for work 17+ inch feels like it weighs a ton and takes a large bag to carry  and was hoping this would be something that I could use to replace  it for when I travel unfortunately it can't. The weight is nice  feels light partially owing to the bottom of it is plastic the form is about half the size of my laptop the keys have nice give and don't feel cramped (do loose out on a number pad). It is a great computer when you have access to the internet as it syncs with the google  environment letting me use shared docs and sheets.  and run web applications but there are some thing I cant do as it is not a widows environment tried using an app to do a remote desktop and that did not provide the experience I was hoping for and some of the apps you download need that internet connection, while I can tether to my phone sometimes I am remote where cell service isn't an option either. so having some programs local would be nice. It does start extremely fast and the lay flat  hinge allows you to display to a hole table  which works for some drawings instead of having to crowd to one side of a laptop. (and has a nice mat finish on the screen to help with glare) If you know what a chromebook can and cant do and have a steady internet connection this could be a good computer for you that is good for personal use while looking clean and stylish enough to look professional.","First off this works perfectly for what I wanted it for... sitting on the couch, relaxing, while the TV is on. I do not use this for work or gaming, I have a desktop for that. I was using a tablet, but honestly I hate it. I just can't adjust to typing on a touch screen, I want a real keyboard. I also hate fingerprints on my screen. I deal with it on my phone, but for a larger screen it makes me crazy. So I figured this would be a good solution, when it popped up for review. It fits comfortably on my lap and the screen is small enough I can see over it to watch tv, but large enough it is easy on my eyes. So far its been great, although I miss the left and right mouse buttons built into the touch pad area of most laptops. Maybe its a Chromebook thing, but I will just have to adjust. I will say though it does feel a bit flimsy. I like the lightness, but in my lap typing I can feel the plastic body flexing. For the price I'd expect something a bit more durable, at least for the bottom half with the keyboard. The keys are responsive, although I'm use to my mechanical keyboard so switching to the thin chiclet style makes them feel mushier than they probably are. For a small laptop, they don't feel cramped and they are raised enough that I'm not miss-typing. It was incredibly easy to set up, just entered my google log-in info and poof I was up and running. This would be a 5 star product if they hadn't just made it a bit sturdier.","This is simply a beautiful machine that is now on sale, but even at $500 it is worth the price for its speed, features, display and top notch function! If you have another laptop that is on the more expensive side like I do, then this is the Chromebook that you want for business travel because it is capable in every way. The display is awesome and the construction is sturdy. I like how light it is and the way it lies flat for presentations and meetings. The best feature of this for me is the 8GB of RAM which means that it is as fast as my home laptop and I am not slowed down with any of the computing, streaming or tasks I need to complete on the road. It is awesome.","Only about 14 inches in size- laptop is small, portable and compact. It's lightweight and easy to carry. As far as appearance, it's silver streamlined and has a back lit keyboard. The light-up keyboard is helpful making it easier for typing. Screen has a great colors, very clear and crisp picture. The sound and screen quality are good. It was super easy to set up- just put your WI-FI password in, get a couple updates and you're connected. The updates took only a couple seconds to minutes. Literally, 2 minutes and the thing was ready to use. It's a Chromebook so it has your standard features plus a couple more. All the basics work well, has a couple small disadvantages you'd find with your typical Chromebook but the features you get in return make up for it. Overall- it's a good laptop with a clear sharp screen that works well at browsing the internet. If you're looking for a well made compact Chromebook i'd recommend it.","I like the color of the laptop... I received a silver one. It's shiny and smooth to the touch. It is slim and wide, and I mention this because the dimensions make that aspect very noticeable. I'm not sure why this is advertised as 14\" when I measured it, it came to 12.5 inches and 8 inches wide. The laptop does have some weight to it, but its not too heavy. The bottom of it is thicker than the top. The back of keyboard lights up and dims after sometime of no activity. It was easy to setup with my google account and took less than 10 minutes. The volum is loud. The computer runs fast and smooth. Startup takes a few seconds. I also used it to transfer a video file to a flash drive and it did that quickly. There is a micro sd card reader, 2 usb-c ports, a regular usb port, and a mic jack. The mouse on the keyboard is smooth and manuevers well. I have not had any problems with it lagging or freezing either.","As an experienced Chromebook user,  I like this chromebook. Has a good screen, very compact body for the screen size, large trackpad.  I like that is has 8 gig of memory so it is more future proof than a 4 gig memory module.  Nice port selection with usb-c and usa-a ports. I am taking off one star---the keyboard is good--but they should have picked a different color for the keys as they can be harder to read at times depending on the light and backlight.  Silver on silver was a bad idea! Also--price--Do not pay more than $400 for this, or wait a bit and it should drop further.  There are a lot of new chromebooks coming out and I imagine with a core m3 processor....it should be cheaper than units with a core I3 or I5 processor.","No touchscreen.  Having to learn a new browser\/language.  Wanted to learn linux now how the perfect vehicle to do so.  Compact and lightweight.  Do have lots of battery time.  Not a Windows laptop ... learning curve on this machine.  If you are looking for something that will run Windows games, programs this is not the machine.  There is tweaking or converting to linux.  But for what it's worth, it is a good laptop.  For echinical stuff -- read the page.  The techs have already supplied all that stuff.","As far as chromebooks go, this one is incredible. Super quick and full of features. The screen resolution is on point. The battery life is long. The structural integrity is solid! I've never thought i'd use a chromebook more than my computer, but here we are. I love it, and you might too.","I got this laptop on Black Friday when it was $320, and I think it was well worth the money. I am a student and  after doing A LOT of research, this was the best chromebook i could find for the money. The biggest pros for me are the screen size, the quality of the keyboard, and the battery life. The cons are that I wish it were a bit thinner and lighter, and the screen isn't the best quality. But for the price, I don't think it could be better.","I've had this for the weekend and it's nice to have a phone in computer style! This is much faster than my phone and super lightweight! Look forward to carrying this verses my heavy Macbook pro, and just leave that work horse in a stationary place.","Nice computer, came on as I opened it. It loaded fast and was fast online.

Tilt it slightly away and the screen gets dark and poor color representation, tilt it slightly toward you and the screen washes out bad. I would not have bought this if I saw it first. You need to stay directly in front of the screen for it to look ok. Even at its best its not great, or even good.","Trying to set it up the guys voice is clearly judgemental and mocking you ,and you suffer due to inadequacy.   Giving you the phrase\"that in not correct try again\" I. Hear the guy say your a putz and I feel small","I purchased this laptop for my fourteen year old daughter as a gift for her birthday to use for high school and for some light gaming. So far it has met my expectations and I must say for a lower end model I am impressed with the performance and usability. For a teenager or young adult it is a good starter laptop, my take on it is this: \u201cThis is your \u2018trial\u2019 machine. Show me that you can take care of this one and then we can talk about the i7, 8GB RAM and off board video for your next birthday.\u201d It runs Minecraft without issue and skypes... get a home\/student license for MS Office and they will have nothing to complain about.","Horrible  Sending it back. It will not allow my student to get on her network at school.

I immediately returned the laptop.","Really upset the display on this laptop is awful . I love the computer it's pretty fast and the sound is awesome. But, as you can see in the video you can't see the display well unless you are looking at the screen straight on, and even then if you move even the slightest display will fade . I've spent hours trying different graphics settings, the graphics are Intel UHD and the UHD settings are not there . I've concluded that it's the monitor I'm going to complain to Dell if I get no response from them I'll be returning to Amazon.","Bought on prime day for the wife, she loves it but only uses it for medial tasks, it would not stand up to my day to day requirements but for simple things and portable entertainment it works just fine","Great value for a 2-in-1 laptop from a reliable company, Dell.

I plugged in the power module and powered on the machine.  Set up was coordinated by Cortana and was so simple I had to laugh.  Once setup was completed I began looking at the already loaded apps.  Some I think will come in handy, others not so much.  Removing (uninstalling) those that I didn't want was easily done right in the windows menu. Adding apps from the windows store is easy, but if you want to add third party apps, you have to jump through a few hoops to turn on that feature.  Once that was accomplished, I was able to install Firefox.  I use other apps that will go on this week. I noticed several complaints from other commenters that the machine got too hot.  I didn't have that problem.  The laptop did get warm, but not overly so.  I have a lap table that I've used in the past eliminating the need for any laptop to sit directly on my legs.  Using it allows more airflow to the machine and provides a more comfortable \"table\" for the machine to sit on. The touch screen will take a bit to get use to.  I've used an iPad for years which has a completely different touch interface.  This is my first touch screen laptop.  I think I will enjoy that feature once I get my fingers to respond correctly. The one issue many might find cumbersome is the slow internet interface.  For some reason this machine doesn't communicate well with my router.  Ironically I challenged it against my iPad and found it took almost twice as long to load pages that the iPad had no problems with.  Thankfully this machine is a backup to my office desktop so I won't be on it all day long. I do wish it came bundled with a USB DVD player\/burner for loading software\/apps and playing movies as well as an rj45 jack for direct connection to the router. The hard drive is somewhat small compared to other machines on the market with only 128 meg of storage.  Most other machine have at least a half meg or more.  That fact may cause grief for other prospective buyers. For me, this is a good machine.  Hopefully it will remain so.","Why a 14 inch laptop? Why a touch screen? My kids have to take computers to school. Their school does not allow lockers, so they must carry all of their books all day. Space and weight in their back packs is a premium. Last year I sent my oldest with an 11 inch chrome book. This Dell 14 inch notebook is so much nicer. It has a touch screen, so the screen is glass like an iPad or tablet. It\u2019s resolution is much higher than the old chrome book, not 4K, but for a mid priced, all in one, hybrid tablet\/notebook, the resolution, weight, and features are fantastic. I\u2019ve heard it said, \u201cthe jack of all trades, but the master of none\u201d. It\u2019s a fair statement, and it holds true here. But a device does not need to be the master of all devices to meet your needs. For us, evaluating what we need, and finding it in a price that suits our budget is important. This computer, is very nice. It\u2019s battery seems to last a full work\/school day, so far. It has Bluetooth, and can pair to Apple airpods!! It\u2019s screen has a luxury feel, and it\u2019s streaming quality is great. It\u2019s ability to fold completely in half to become the largest tablet ever, or sit upright like a laptop, makes it infinitely more useful than either device separately, while keeping bulk and heft to a minimum. If I have any concern, it\u2019s going to be the durability of the glass screen, surviving the rigors of backpack life. Time will tell.","This laptop is for simple needs and probably best for those just looking for a tablet-like device. It doesn't have a CD drive(which probably won't matter to most, with streaming being more popular these days, but I like having this feature), nor does it have a side number panel on the keyboard. My husband has been mainly using it to turn in reports for work purposes. His needs are super simple, so he didn't need anything incredibly fancy. It's worked pretty well for him. That said, he really misses having the side number panel on the keyboard, since this is how he typically types in numbers. I've used it a bit for review purposes, but my needs are simple, like his. Other than it feeling awkward to type on the keyboard and moving slowly at times, I've been mostly pleased with it. While my children mostly use our larger family computer for school work, we like having this one around for that purpose if need be, too. That's where this one's touch screen comes in especially handy. With sites like ABCmouse, the touchscreen is easier for them and when they've used this one, they've did well with it. The battery life has been excellent so far, and we're happy about that. Overall, this isn't the best laptop if you have high level needs from it, but if your needs are super simple, it works well enough. We've all been mostly pleased with it.","My home computer is slowly dying and while I will eventually replace it, I was thrilled to have a chance to use and review this Dell Inspiron 14 inch 2 in 1 Laptop. For the most part, I am quite pleased with this laptop. It was incredibly easy to set up \u2013 the laptop basically \u201ctalked\u201d me through the setup. The laptop is very fast \u2013 it turns on and off quite quickly (and shuts itself off if idle for a period of time). This laptop is great for using to do simple everyday things like checking your email, going on Facebook, playing on-line games, surfing the internet, etc. The touchscreen feature is nice and makes the laptop easier to use (although my arm can get tired at times while using it). As much as I like this laptop and use it every day, it does have some limitations. I would have liked more than 4GB RAM. This laptop doesn\u2019t have a CD Drive \u2013 maybe not a necessity for many these days but a necessity for me as I do still occasionally install programs through a CD. When looking at the menu, it seems like the laptop is full of nice features but you soon find out that you have to pay to use many of them \u2013 for example, you would have to pay a yearly fee to use Microsoft Office which I refuse to do. This Dell Inspiron 14 inch 2 in 1 Laptop has some limitations but it is a good basic everyday laptop.","***UPDATED REVIEW**** 9\/28\/19 I have really enjoyed this computer but in the end, it's filled with misleading \"pay to play\"  options. You have this built in with \"S\" mode and you cannot switch out of this mode unless you BUY the Windows 10 program for $150. Disgusting! The price point is already enough to have Windows 10 built in, but instead, you are stuck with a limited computer that only allows \"approved\" downloads until you upgrade. NOT happy. This has gone from a 4 star review, to a 1 star. ORIGINAL REVIEW I have been using Mac for a realllly long time.  This took me a bit to get used to as the windows processor is not something we are familiar with. However, it's very intuitive and easy to learn. I really love the touch screen and the multi ability to use as a lap top as well as a tablet. It's easy to throw in my backpack and take with me on trips and on the go. The design is beautiful and it fires up fast. It would be great if it came with a tablet pen, but that's not always a given when you buy a tablet. My daughter loves it for research and I love it for everyday online activity. The speakers are great, the screen is bright and beautiful. Overall a very reasonably priced laptop\/tablet that serves our needs well. I would prefer a larger memory which would help with editing but for every day basic computer use this is a top of the line machine. Extremely pleased.","As others have noted, you can only use specific Microsoft apps, so for example, when trying to upload another browser that I prefer, I really got the runaround so much that I gave up and had to just go with the default setting. Also there\u2019s an irritating watermark about me needing to upgrade something or download some windows thing, and I really don\u2019t know how to make it go away. The usual abundance of pop-ups are also irritating, but it\u2019s not the end of the world. As far as speed goes, I recently had gotten another Dell computer that was quite a bit more expensive (about $400 more) than this one, and yet it was significantly slower. This one\u2019s not exactly fast either, especially if you\u2019re trying to do online classes, but it\u2019s ok. You have to sit there and wait for pages to load for the MyCourses platform, so I don\u2019t recommend this PC for that necessarily. Even so, given the low price tag of this computer, it\u2019s a great value for people on a budget who need to get basic things done. The touchscreen feature is a nice bonus, and overall, I like it.","This is not an amazing computer for anybody who wants to do serious computing, at least not for my needs. I need a bigger hard drive and more RAM. However, this computer is perfect for my daughter who plays some games and does basic word processing on Google Docs. I am not even bothering activating the Microsoft products, and instead will either install Libre Office or just stick with the browser versions of Google's apps. So far the battery life has been really good and everything has worked as stated. So, if you want something simple, and a touchscreen computer for a low price, then this is your computer. If you want something more than this, I would definitely look elsewhere. I have a computer from 2011 with better specs.","This is the first pc that I've owned that I could touch the screen.  It's a great nifty laptop.  You do need to activate windows when you get it, you'll see instructions in the box.  Without it, you're in a pickle. I love this  laptop, I can bend it backwards and prop it up to watching things, or to use as a personal tablet. It's fast, sleek and I just love it.  It has all of the latest apps and is so easy to use.","This laptop is awesome. This has 2 in 1 function as a laptop and a tablet.  The touchscreen is a nice added feature too. I am impressed with the speed of this laptop, it also comes with WINDOWS 10 installed.  It also has Cortana assistant which allows voice search for anything. The Gen Intel Core wonderful. The laptop has a nice design. The battery lasts a long time. The laptop is lightweight and has all the necessary USB outlets. The start up is easy and fast. I am satisfied with its working speed and screen picture quality. Could use a longer charger cord and does not have CD-Rom. I recommend it.","This computer is slower than any I've had for the past decade.  It takes at least 7 minutes just to get from turning it on to a browser, assuming it is completely up-to-date.  All other functions are super-slow as well.  It's worse, of course, if I have to install updates (which happens every week or so).  I just wish I could get my money back for this piece of garbage.","This laptop has been fairly good. Setup was easy and it runs pretty good, but it keeps logging me out and causing minor annoyances that I have never experienced with other computers. Not sure what the problem is, but overall happy with it.","I liked the touch screen, but after a few days it started to freeze. I waisted my money. I needed a laptop for studying but now I\u2019m suffering while I thought I was doing the right thing. I called support service multiple times but no one could find solutions to fix it until my eligibility will my service Program I paid for was expired. Now my laptop is on my table as an expo at museum.","Nice"],"6":["This is my first Chromebook and I love it. The simplicity of this thing is amazing, I have an expensive Windows 10 PC that drives me crazy, I find Windows has become a very intrusive and confusing computer, that bothers you with a load of notifications and pop ups. Trying to figure out how to disable all that stuff is a real pain, Windows seems to bury all those settings, making them hard to find.  This Chromebook is none of that, the ease of this is like using a smartphone. I have absolutely no problem with the screen resolution , it looks fine to me. I can't comment on the battery life because I've yet to unplug it, I use it strictly as a stay in one place computer (plugged in all the time). Google Docs and files take a little getting used to if you never used them, but once you get used to it you'll have no problem. It was not a problem for me because I was already use them on my iPhone . You can't download outside programs because its a closed system, to me , that's a good thing because I only use it to surf the web, shop, emails and files. And because you can't download programs your not gonna pick up any viruses. If you need to edit any photos you can always download a photo app from the Play store. I've found the storage and speed for this to be just fine, it doesn't seem to slow down with numerous tabs open. You have a load of apps to download from the Google play store that should keep you happy. I don't use it to stream movies or play games so I can't comment on that, I'll streams stuff from YouTube with no problems at all. If you want a laptop to do just the basics like I do, then you can't go wrong with this for the price. To me it's way better then one of those low cost Windows PC's. I had a low end Windows PC that I bought  as a extra computer for me to use when my wife is working on the expensive PC, I hated it so much I gave it away before it was a month old. Besides being intrusive and confusing, it was slow as crap. This Chromebook is like having a giant smartphone with a keyboard, (IT'S THAT EASY). The only reason I took away one star is because I think it could of used one more USB port, other then that I love it, and if you use a computer like I do, you will too. PS. Keep in mind that this model S330 comes in different specs. My review is based on the model with the higher resolution screen  (1920 x 1080) and more memory (64gb). They have a cheaper model called the S330 with less resolution and less memory.","The FHD (1920x1080p) version of the Lenovo S330 definitely does NOT have an IPS display. The panel is reminiscent of what you'd see on a Windows XP era laptop. No matter what angle you choose, it looks washed out. Some colors are so undersaturated that it's hard to see gradients. Lenovo's decision to put a non-IPS display on the S330 is baffling. It's a real shame too, because otherwise, the S330 is a very nice Chromebook for the price. The keyboard feels great, the trackpad has an amazing texture, and overall the build quality is quite good. However, without an IPS display, it's a new car with an engine from the 1970's. It'll work...but why?","This is a great Chromebook if you buy it with \"realistic\" expectations. It's not the fastest around but it's good enough for web browsing, editing docs, using android apps, and watching Netflix\/YouTube. Plus it comes with 64GB of storage which trumps the meager 16GB found on the average budget Chromebook. One thing that sucks about Chrome OS is that android apps can't see an SD card--so more internal storage is a must if you're like to download Netflix movies for offline viewing (through the official app). The screen could be a little better, though. It's 1080p and the viewing angles aren't the best, but it gets the job done. What more do you expect for this price?","... you receive a written promise from Lenovo quality control that they'll pay YOU for the time you'll need to spend doing their job for them. I've had this Lenovo Chromebook for just a few days, and already I've spent too much time restarting it. On the same day it arrived, it began to freeze and turn off. Repeatedly. I ran powerwash several times. Same issue. The value proposition for this Chromebook is that you can simply open the box, and get started working, hassle-free.  Value has not been delivered. If I wanted this much aggravation, I'd run one of my old Dell's with Vista. UPDATE: 4\/23. Ran powerwash two more times. Spoke with Amazon. Spoke with Lenovo. Ran complete recovery of Chrome OS. Still freezes and crashes. Just ordered a second one for arrival 4\/23, and am returning this one. Perhaps this one is just a lemon. If the second machine works as it should, I'll update here. If it doesn't, I'll return it also and post a second review. Total time wasted so far: 12 hours and counting.","I was nervous about ordering this Chromebook many months before arrival. It was a Christmas gift for my husband. However, it arrived as scheduled in great condition. We had been looking for an affordable Chromebook of good quality for watching videos, browsing the internet and using google documents. The battery life is awesome and the resolution is great. He's been using it since December and is very happy with it. Would recommend!","I purchased this Chromebook after my 4 year old Toshiba Chromebook 2 finally started having issues. I paid almost the same price back in 2015 for the Toshiba that I did for the Lenovo. I was hoping to find a similar quality machine and boy was I wrong. Here are the main issues with the Lenovo. Screen Quality - I have no idea what Lenovo was thinking with this screen. You have to have the perfect angle to see anything, and even once you find that angle, it still looks like garbage. The colors are always washed out, black text on a white background looks almost grey. This is embarrassing for a lcd screen made in the past 10 years. Speakers - I listen to a lot of videos and music on my chromebook. My old Toshiba had amazing sound for a chromebook, and I was not expecting to find the same quality without paying for it. But the \u201cspeakers\u201d that the Lenovo have are hilarious. I can\u2019t believe how bad they are. Not only are they very flat and hollow sounding, you can barely hear them at max volume. I even tried using the \u201cAudio EQ\u201d extension, that allows you to boost the preamp and increase volume. Even with that it truly sounds like you have headphones plugged in, sitting on the desk with the volume max. Terrible! Wifi - I have plenty of devices in my home running on a 5Ghz connection with 100+ mb\/s internet. Everything works fine...But the Lenovo. Sitting 5\u2019 away from the router shows a \u201cmedium\u201d connection strength. This translated when trying to watch videos and every new video had to \u201cload\u201d for a second, before dropping the quality down for a minute or two while the computer tried catch up. The battery seemed to hold up after a day of \"Using it\". Mainly trying to find if some setting was causing all of the issues and poor quality. The keyboard felt fine. Trackpad was fine. I ended up returning this and buying the Acer Chromebook 14. These two should not be within $300 of each other. If the Lenovo was a $150 chromebook, I could argue that for the price, at least it kind of works. But when they are asking the same price as some of the other brands that are much higher quality, I had to leave a review to warn others. I use a $2500+ Lenovo workstation laptop everyday as an engineer and I have nothing bad to say about it. But this Chromebook is garbage. Don\u2019t buy it. Find other options.","Its a good chromebook. I love the keyboard(very clicky) 4gb of ram is def enough to run Spotify, 4tabs on chrome and run my homework app at the same time. The screen is a lil meh... But I don't expect much from device of this price. I've been enjoying it as a college students.","I've wanted a Chromebook for years, but could never really justify the purchase...until recently. I've been taking some trips out of town, and needed to be available for work, just in case, but I didn't want to risk taking my work laptop with me on the trips. So, I bought this Chromebook. I use Chrome Remote Desktop to control my work laptop, which is sitting at home, and it's been a great experience. With a good WIFI connection, It feels just like I'm working on the remoted machine. The keyboard feels good, and I'm able to type just fine. I thought I'd be missing having function keys, but there's a system setting to treat the top row of icon keys as if they were F1 - F10, and it works great. If I want to use whatever the icon for that key is supposed to do, I just press the search key (just above the shift key) to use those keys. Apart from needing this for work, most of what I use the computer for is web-related stuff; looking things up, email, watching videos, etc. This works great for that. I'm amazed that a machine for just over $200 can do everything I need to do. The screen is a little washed out, color-wise, but after a couple of days, I don't even notice that any more. The battery life is amazing. I've been working on it now for a couple of hours, and it says I've still got 9 hours of battery left.","The ad title says the display has a 1920x1080 HD display, however the best the chromebook I got can do is 1518x853. It also says there is 64 GB of storage, yet after starting the computer Im left with 22 GB of storage. What the heck is it with lenovo laptops having this resolution issue? I wish I got what I paid for because otherwise this would be a great laptop for my schooling.","This is very much a case where if you are realistic in your expectations, you will be quite happy with the product. Chromebooks serve a rather specific purpose, and are built at a pretty low price point. They are basically just really low end laptops, so low in spec that they only run well on a web-browser-based operating system. Most have low resolution screens of varying quality. If you need something with full HD 1920x1080 resolution, this Lenovo is one of the very few options. And for the price, this is a great laptop. Yes, the display has a pretty narrow viewing angle. But you shouldn't expect a Retina or MS Surface quality display at this price point. It gets the job done, it is bright and clear (at the right angle) and it has better resolution than anything else at this price. The wifi is a little weak, but again, it does the job. Everything else about it is quite solid. Battery life is superb. The keys have just the right amount of travel and resistance to make typing very comfortable. The touchpad works as it should. It has just enough weight to feel like a real laptop, but without feeling heavy. So again, be realistic in your expectations. Next to a $1300 Surface, this Lenovo comes up way short. But against anything else in the sub $350 market, it is a great buy. At the current Amazon Warehouse price of $200, it is a steal. I bought the refurb\/warehouse version. It came in the original box with all of the packaging. I couldn't even tell it had ever been opened. Not a scratch, dent, or mark on it.","Lenovo Chromebook 330S:  Excellent value for the money, wanted to replace a capable but heavy Lenovo Thinkpad that I was carrying from school to home.  I use an ipad daily in classroom teaching, but was limited by compatibility issues with school's Smartboard and other equipment.  For creating and editing documents, compatibility issues abounded with the loathsome Word for ios and Google Docs can't come close to the flexibility of creating documents in standard-version Word.  I worried that there is little-to-no storage on Chromebooks, but adding a micro SSD card allows for onboard, sleekly integrated storage, which can supplement cloud storage or an external drive if desired.  Solid feel to keyboard, bright crisp picture, very fast internet and processing speed.  USB-C can charges in both directions, adapters (to USB-A or other port types) allow charging of other devices without their dedicated chargers.  This model came with HDMI.  I would add a dedicated 'delete' key and touchscreen capability.","I needed a laptop for college, and this Chromebook has been really useful in class. It's really nice to have most of my textbooks on my laptop, and taking notes is very convenient with this Chromebook. Since none of the courses that I plan on taking require me to download programs that for a Windows 10 computer, this Laptop was perfect for me. Even if you don't plan on using it for work-related things, this laptop is very great for entertainment because of its amazing battery life which is something that most Windows Laptops lack since they require more processing power. But this Lenovo laptop is perfect for youtube, Netflix and many other streaming sites. It's truly an amazing Chromebook for all of your basic needs","I purchased this chromebook to replace a 2017 13\" Mackbook Air that was bricked by spilled beer, so I am sort of judging the Lenovo by Apple hardware and software standards. The Lenovo FHD screen is as good as the Mac, adequately bright indoors. The Lenovo recognizes SD cards, thumb drives, and external HHDs I formatted as exFAT on the Mac, although Chrome does not support encryption of external drives. The keyboard isn't backlit and the touchpad could be more spacious but both are OK otherwise. Chrome OS seems to be as usable as Mac OS for everyday use for web, mail, watching video, etc. I find Chrome a lot better experience than Windows 10. Understatement. I really have not missed the Macbook and saved $900 with the Lenovo over buying the new Air. $900! When my 2009 Mac Mini dies will I get a Chromebox desktop? We shall see.","This thing is trash. Broke in less than 6 months with minimal use and ran like crap beforehand. Looked great on paper but it can barely do anything. Screen resolution was terrible and cannot be seen when looking from off to the side. Constantly running slow doing the most simplest of things. Forget multitasking, it can't handle it. It basically delivered the quality of an internet appliance in 2002 with the durability of a Happy Meal toy. Screen is now completely broken simply from opening and closing it.","This is amazing.  Highly recommend.  The idea for me was to stop using a laptop and move entirely online.  I tried to do that with my phone about 5 years ago, but that was just too new.  This is also the way to go for aging parents who need email, and online banking, cloud storage photos, etc.  So fast and easy to use, with a good screen (although you do need to be at the right angle to see the screen clearly...depending on your situation that can be a good thing for privacy).  It is not featherweight, but it is very portable and great to presentations and zooming through the cloud.","Received this product the other day and so far it has been great. I have used google chrome exclusively for years but I have always owned a windows laptop. I never use any of the windows products and I would rather be completely ignorant than ever use Bing so it seemed smart to just buy a Chromebook, also my phone is an android so syncing was easy. Having none of the windows crap to bog me down this laptop is very fast. It starts up where I left off almost immediately and if not for my crappy HughesNet it would be blazing. For roughly 250.00 it was a great deal. Gave it 4stars because of no touchscreen and the screen quality could be slightly better but for the price I am very satified.","My middle-schoolers do a lot of work at school on Chromebooks through Google Classroom.  I wanted to give them a similar experience at home while keeping the cost reasonable and support overhead very low.  The Lenovo Chromebook S330 was just the trick.  This thing is fast, the screen is clear and bright and the battery life is awesome with an estimated life of 13 hours.  Is it really 13 hours?  Who knows, but it last through 6 hours of constant and showed a little over half battery remaining, so it seems reasonable. For perspective, \"best\" in terms of computer hardware and operating system really comes down to your intended use.  You'll get the best value and have the best experience when you buy for that intended use.  For what I've  described above, this Chromebook is perfect.  I could have spent a lot more on a high-performance gaming rig or something with a touchscreen and all the extras, but that's not what was needed. We haven't had it very long, so I'll post back if any of my initial impressions and observations change.","Item was Bought in August 31st 2019 and as at October, 20days after the return period closes (September30) the Keyboard goes bad and needs to be replaced. Now, as at November 14, 2019 the computer has stopped charging. Calling Customer service won\u2019t make a difference as they won\u2019t help you either...","I purchased this so my wife could have her PC back. I'm writing the next great trilogy of magic realism, The Memory Tapes of John I. Pearl, using a process of drafting manuscripts in Google Docs, transferring to Microsoft Word on a Mac, and then fine-tuning prior to export to Kindle Direct Publishing. For the price, this can't be beat. Some suggestions for improvement: better screen resolution and contrast adjustment. And the power cord should be pin rather than a mini - plug . I'm concerned that the interior connection may get loosened over time as the computer gets moved about....bumping the cord will unseat that interior connection and possibly diminish performance. So I try not to bump that little baby. All in all, this does everything I had hoped it would do. Basically, a plug in and play device. EASY PEASY.","Simple and easy to use. Chromebooks have become way better compared to 3 yrs ago. It's not a speed demon but for your average college student\/internet oriented tasks, this is for you. Super affordable and better than a pc at this price.","This replaces an Asus chromebook which I really liked.  I like this one better though.  Nice screen, good keyboard, fast enough for my purposes, just works great.  I find nothing not to like about it.","Many problems encountered starting with you can only have a few windows open at the same time or everything freezes (had to reboot to get it to close windows and work properly), no ability to copy\/save screen shots or even to copy\/paste from anything, I am still unable to get the computer to work on my scanner or printer (it wants to send everything to the Google Cloud ... these are confidential tax reports that I can not allow someone else to get hold of), and finally I was watching a program in a public place with my noise cancelling earbuds which should have shut off the exterior sound but it didn't ... talk about pissed when I learned that everyone around me also heard everything I was listening to.  I purchased this after reading multiple on-line reports touting that the Levono lines were made for business professionals and the \"non-gamers\".  Do wish I could just return the unit (Amazon doesn't allow unless it is \"dead on arrival\") - it is a very expensive waste for just being able to read emails and view web pages.","This is a good value for a budget machine.  Its austere plastic body probably wouldn't survive much abuse but it does have a mat texture that wards off finger prints.  It's nice to have the 14\" 1920 x 1080 mat screen and thin bezel.  On a full charge I can go eight hours editing text while streaming music from wi-fi to bluetooth headphones and leave a good third of the battery remaining.  It comes with Google Drive of course but I easily synced Dropbox as well using a free third party app.  What I like most is that now you can install Linux apps.  No need for Crouton.  You just open a terminal in Chrome OS and type something like \"sudo apt install libreoffice\" say, and you end up with a new shortcut that you can pin to the \"shelf\" (taskbar) and from there said app can be launched, all while never leaving the Chrome OS desktop.  You can keep a separate storage space for your Linux data or \"share\" your Google Drive data with Linux.  So you can for example use Linux's Libre Office Write to open and save a file directly from\/to the cloud, preserving the Chrome OS thin-client motif.","I guess I didn't realize how limited a chromebook is.  You can only print wirelessly,  no label printers, only one usb port. Also miss the number pad.  Works good to go online,  very lightweight, very cheap do I'll keep it but it did not fit the small business spot I needed it.  Make sure you know what you get with a chromebook.","I've had this laptop for about a week or so now. I'm a 32 year old IT professional who mostly just browses the web and pays bills on my personal laptop. But I'm studying more now and going to coffee shops with my wife. This laptop is perfect for that kind of thing. I've gotten 10 plus hours of battery life. I love that it uses USB-C to charge. It's surprisingly fast. The screen is good if your looking directly at it. My only gripe is that it has poor viewing at angles. But for the price, who cares. I would recommend this laptop to anyone.","The atmosphere is similar to Lenovo ThinkPad 13 Chromebook, The case size and weight are almost the same. The color of the liquid crystal is not good, but the visibility of the character is good. The keyboard feels like Lenovo, and it has a hard click. Of course, it supports Android application and Linux application. I think it is a good ChromeBook with no particular problems. The sound of the speaker is so small. It's OK with Skype etc, but I think you need an external speaker to listen to music.","The criticism of the screen is warranted- it's not that great compared with other chromebook screens of similar price. Performance was OK but not really that great. It's usable but similar to an older Win8 laptop that's 3-4 yrs old. WiFi is fast- lagging performance seems to be processor or graphics. Battery life is strong point though-  >8 hrs with normal browser\/video use can be expected. It's lightweight and the outer surface doesn't show fingerprints etc. I'm looking for a faster chromebook.","For the price, it's hard to complain about this machine, which runs Chrome OS great. The screen, however, is hard to look at. The trackpad is as bad as you would expect for the price. At the end of the day, it's up to your own tolerances for these things, and I got this machine for a teenager, not myself, so it fits the bill fine.","This chromebook has a lot of storage, 14 inch was perfect for me, it runs very fast. Very fast shipping. I am very happy with the product .","I purchased this as a gift, and I am impressed with the quality of Laptop we got for under $250. Sure, it's not a top of the line device, but for someone who just wants it to Google things, Watch Netflix and Disney+, Check facebook, and listen to music while checking emails, this laptop is a great deal! Very pleased, will update if anything changes.","This Lenovo Chromebook just came in today and everything seemed fine at first. I was able to sign in my main Google account but when I signed out to add my 2nd Google account, this weird image was shown in the login screen and kept flickering. I thought I had my hand on a wrong place but I didn't. I decided to do a full reset and it still showed the flickering image. I was able to take some pics but does anyone know what this is? I most likely will have to return this...","Works great, easy to work with.","This is my 3rd Chromebook and the best. Wakes almost immediately, battery is great, screen and sound are good (neither make you feel like you are in a movie theater but I don't see\/hear any issues I want to change), and it is not slow. Size is right. Highly recommended.","big miss on the screen.  The rest of the laptop is solid...but seriously with this screen?  I had a Lenovo Chromebook before this, and it was great,so I'm not sure why they put this washed out mistake on here.  Imean, other than the screen it's pretty good, but this was a huge miss for how they pitched it.","Specifically bought this for video streaming. I've been trying to stick with it, but I give up. Stalls out, pixelated video. And no, it's not my connection. For online work, googledocs etc... it's fine, but really, this is an absolute piece of crap. Zero stars if I could!","I use this to remote into my main workstation with Google Remote Desktop. If it gets lost or stolen I don't care! That's how cheap it is! But still very usable. Battery life is crazy on these things, don't get a Chromebook with anything bigger than an i3","Alright for a VERY BASIC computer. Hassle to type up documents on because Microsoft office can only be run on an app and it is almost impossible to format papers and powerpoints. Wish I had known this when buying it. Want to sell it, but won\u2019t get even close to what I paid for. Disposable computers.","Wife needed a new laptop for work, she decided to try a chromebook and instantly fell in love with it. Does everything and more than she expected.","The screen went out on this piece of garbage in less than a month but too close the return window. My daughter was doing a Study Abroad in Puerto Rico so returning it before the return window closed was an impossibility.  I'm going to try and repair it with a new screen if the price is reasonable for the screen.  Stay away from this model.","I bought this Chromebook from Lenovo on Amazon. I was really excited when I received it. It's nice looking machine.  Now the screen flickers and poor, if any video playback. A waste of money and very disappointing. Now I'm back to using my Acer Chromebook c720. Best Chromebook I ever bought. But no longer has support, due to end of life. My Acer still works like the day I got it. I am on a fixed income and cannot afford to replace it. Not happy!","Nice HD display.  Fast startup and long battery life.  Sometimes has trouble with buffering on streaming video.  A concerning thing is that a message popped up from the OS today that said in 2020 Flash Player would no longer be supported.","I have to return this computer because Norton Security (which I have) does not work with Chromebook.  Most frustrating since I am not a very computer savvy person and it took me a while to put in and now delete information.","The LCD panels looks faded like back in the days when they first came out, but if you're looking for a cheap Chromebook to just brows the web...then this is for you, as long as you don't mind the faded looking screen.","This was supposed to be an upgrade from my old hand-me-down 10yr laptop but it's slow, laggy and well below average. Sometimes it feels like I'm using a computer from the early 2000s. Hopefully, it's just mine that sucks. Happy shopping","Product as Expected","It would be a lot better if it was touch screen. My mistake for not ordering a touch screen. Other than that it is fine, dose everything I wanted it to do.","laptop works great and no trouble as of now.....","it is a decent book, nothing to impress about","A bland laptop: no real weaknesses, no real strengths.

Perfect for my needs!!","Just started using it but it looks nice and it's fast","It's very simple and that's what I love about it.","Perfect for school","Works great","Cons: Weight - it\u2019s not as light as I was expecting it to be. I realize that\u2019s a pretty subjective statement. Screen Not super sharp and not high contrast. I compared it to a very similar screen, but in a top-of-the-line Lenovo model: A Thinkpad T460s, same size and resolution. Text on the T460s is visibly sharper at the same size, and has better blacks and richer colors. I tested this by viewing the same websites and pages. Colors are off from nearly any angle except straight-on, as another viewer mentioned. It\u2019s pretty obvious with a white screen when Night Mode is enabled. The lower half will be blueish but the top half more yellow-ish with the night mode. Speed - I\u2019m on a computer ALL DAY LONG, and so I notice things like the speed to open up a site, and what\u2019s typical. For sure, launching something like YouTube or Gmail takes 50-75% longer than on a 2-generation old laptop (my T460s). It\u2019s also slower than my Macbook Air. Mouse - In my opinion it inherits Linux\u2019s poor mouse support. The one issue: scroll wheel speed. It\u2019s better than desktop Linux, because there\u2019s some acceleration added. But scrolling with the wheel is still too slow to be comfortable for me. Pros: Nice grippy texture Nice full keyboard size Keyboard is pretty decent to type on as well. Good trackpad --- pretty great, in fact. Better than my Thinkpad running Linux. Three-prong A\/C adapter cord is better than the typical polarized two-prong, in my opinion. Summary: this is a decent entry-level Chromebook, which would make sense at the $100-$150 price point. But close to $300 doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me because of all the compromises. Also note that it doesn\u2019t have the deluxe Chromebook\/laptop features of lit keyboard or touch screen. Those are excellent to have on a device like this that\u2019s mainly used for web access.","I'd only recommend this if you absolutely love Chrome and have to have it on your laptop. For this price range, *in my opinion*, there are much better options. For example, I recently had the opportunity to try Lenevo's Flex 11: https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/aw\/d\/B07GM2J244\/ . That unit does have Windows (a pro for me) but has so much more to offer: 4 gb ddr4 ram vs the 4gb of lpddr3 here, full 2 in 1 (tablet, tent, and laptop modes) vs standard laptop here, and touch screen vs non touch here, and a cpu that can clock at 2.7gb vs 2.4 max here. So quicker, stronger, and more versatile...and, dare I say, more fun machine all around for a very similar price. So again, unless you're all in on Chrome OS, downloading apps from the Playstore, and have everything hardwired into the Google ecosystem, I can't see why this is your best option. Ranting aside, this unit isn't inherently bad. Its snappy and responsive enough, mirrors my Samsung phone in the android sense, and has plently of port connections (usb-c, sd card, usb, and hdmi). It's very functional and budget friendly. I will say the screen is a bit of a con, however. It's generally too dark and dull. I'd try to test drive in store somewhere or at least a comparable model before choosing this one.","I really wanted to love this Lenovo Chromebook S330.  I want to believe that you can get a good Chromebook on a budget, and because I've had previous good experiences with the durability of Lenovo laptops. While the S330 does feel durable, there's a lot of small drawbacks that add up to an uncomfortable experience, especially for users accustomed to a higher-end experience. The size 14-inch display is a good size, but it feels too muted and matte. The colors don't pop and edges of letters etc. are not super sharp because of its low resolution. If you look at it at any angle other than head on, these issues intensify. The build feels solid but also a little cumbersome and heavy compared to slimmer or lighter competitors. On the same note, the keyboard and side buttons feel durable but they also felt too much on the rigid and resistant side, like I had to use just a little too much force to type.  The keyboard doesn't have backlighting. Like all Chromebooks, it was very easy to set up and the Chrome OS naturally avoids bloatware.  It boots super-quickly, but when browsing on the internet, it felt slower than my other regular laptop that was running on the same internet connection. The \"business black\" color is acceptable though not elegant-looking, and the textured surface is easy to clean. Battery life was good, and the trackpad works well.  I like that it has both a USB 3.0 port, USB-C port, an SD slot for storage expansion, and an HDMI out port. Overall, the S330 checks off all the boxes of what a Chromebook needs to do, but it made me itch for more luxurious features and a more elegant design.  It's worth taking on a test drive to see if you feel the same, or are satisfied with what it can deliver.","I am new to Chromebooks, but I needed something that I could hold and surf the Internet with and just watch videos, so I thought it might fit the bill.  I really don't mind the screen at all - it's not the best, but it's perfectly fine for me.  I've watched a few videos with it and never thought twice about the video display quality. I don't really like the keyboard.  It requires a lot of use of hotkeys to use the way I use one.  For instance, I am constantly using my pageUP\/pageDOWN buttons\/End\/Home - but it doesn't have those.  Also, often it is hard to right click to copy and paste, so I have to use Control C &V a lot.  I didn't do this review for a while in order to give myself time to get used to the keyboard, and I did, but I still prefer a regular keyboard with more keys.  It feels ok to type on though.  The hardware works just fine. My main problem with this has been the wifi drops all the time.  I have a very fast Internet connection and I'm used to opening at least 5-6 pages at a time.  FORGET THAT.  I can open about 3 pages then the Internet just ups and disconnects.  IN 10 seconds I can open some more.  That's fine when I am reading forums or social media, but it is NOT good for entering sweepstakes if that's a hobby.  It's also hard to order groceries with - For instance, I can put 3 things in my cart, but I have to wait 10 seconds or so to put anything else in it. I have tried disabling all extensions, re syncing everything, checking time, restarting MY ENTIRE NETWORK, changing to Google's DNS servers, changing power options - and nothing works.  I don't have many running apps so I don't think it's lack of memory causing it.  It's just weird.  It's Fast and responsive- dies - fast and responsive- dies.  The wifi will show good strength the entire time, but diagnostics will show a disconnect during it's 'resting phases.'  It gets tired easily I guess.  I would appreciate it if anyone who has a fix for it would share in a comment. I can't recommend it like this, unless you primarily intend to use it to compose on, or to read on - like E-Books.  It is FINE for reading long documents or web pages on. Now, I LOVE the battery life.  It's a light laptop, so it floors me that a 2 hour charge can keep me reading for 3 days! You can enable a beta version of LINUX on this Chromebook.  It runs in a virtual machine and there is a toggle switch in settings to enable that or disable it.","This is my first Chromebook and so far I'm impressed. For the price, you get a good machine for general web surfing, Google Docs and watching videos. This Chromebook is quick to setup, you just sign in with your Google account. It also syncs well with my Android phone. The computer is a lightweight as my regular laptop and at 14 inches it's a good size to combine portability and comfort. Using the Chromebook, I'm impressed with the speed. It also tells me that I still have 10+ hours of battery life, which is really great for on-the-go. Since it's a Chromebook, you can't download any software to the laptop, only Android apps. So this may be a limiting factor for some people who expect a full-blown laptop. I also appreciate the lack of any bloatware\/spam software on this computer, like you get with most regular laptops. The hardware leave some room for improvement. The doesn't have many function keys (page up\/page down, home, end). I've figured out that if you use Alt+arrow up or Alt+arrow down you can page up or page down, but I'd prefer a dedicated keyboard key for it. The computer also only has one regular USB port, one USB-C port (used for charging) and an HDMI port. If you're planning to plug in a few devices to the laptop, you'll need to have use a port expander to give you more USB slots. Overall, this seems like a great Chromebook for people looking for a simple Chromebook.","Edit: ***Avoid at all cost!*** Original: It's fine if you just need something to browse the web. Netflix, google docs (my initial reason for purchasing) etc. But other than that it's just so useless. Maybe it's my fault for overestimating what I could do with it. But once I found out that I can't even use it for work because chrome no longer supports silverlight, this thing just became a giant paperweight for me. I wanted a simple laptop for minor work and school stuff- and I sure got it. It's so simple you can't even do anything on it. Edit: it actually got worse. I can't even access basic parts of my online classes anymore. This laptop is officially worthless to me. I'm going to give it to a techy friend to play around with the Linux beta and hopefully find a fun use for it. Things I am currently capable of using it for: Making my schedules for with in Google docs, YouTube, Netflix, Spotify, Reddit, signing up for classes,  and porn. Things I attempted to use it for and failed. This doesn't mean it's impossible, but that they weren't available by default: aspects of work I can do on my phone with a Mozilla browser, karaoke off my external (not windows so can't run the program), movies off my external (no built in media player), taking my online classes (unable to view power point by default- sometimes links just don't load), unable to open random file types, unable to play Android apps (tried getting it to work through Linux beta but was unable. I'm not super savvy though), unable to download Steam for Linux to attempt other simple games. Google basically thought it was useful to create a machine with a fraction of the capabilities of any phone or tablet and give it a full size keyboard and long battery life. They are realizing that this is actually not a good idea and are trying to add in Android market place and Linux to put those features back in. By that point- why not just have a laptop and not invent this useless item at all? My biggest regret about buying this product is I had to buy a laptop anyways, so the money spent on this product could have gone towards just having a nicer laptop overall. Newer Chromebooks are adding in more functionality, but their cost is increasing accordingly. This product has a nice low price and non existent functionality to match. ***Avoid at all cost!***","My husband is not that PC proficient and he has been complaining about Windows since the last update.  I finally got him a Chromebook that makes it easy for him to use Google's apps, such as Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Drive.  This is a huge plus since it is easy to set up and he doesn't have to learn anything else to use it.  The screen quality is great, and the battery life is pretty impressive.  It performs smoothly even when you have multiple tabs open and you're streaming video or playing games. Unfortunately, it isn't for office files because you're limited to Microsoft Office Online, the free cloud version of Office via the Chrome browser. You should also keep in mind that Chromebooks are designed to rely heavily on the Internet, which means that many apps simply won't work if you're not connected to the internet.  But if your main concern is surfing the internet, this is a great, less expensive alternative to a tablet.","This was our first Chromebook.  I\u2019ve always been a PC laptop person.  Chromebooks are similar but not laptops.  This is paraphrased from Wikipedia.  A Chromebook is a laptop or tablet running the Linux-based Chrome OS as its operating system. They are mostly used with the Google Chrome Browser.  Most application and data are in the cloud and not on the machine itself.  Hence you need to make sure you have great connectivity.  The first Chromebooks for sale began shipping in 2011.  One of their largest market segments is education. It\u2019s easy to use.  Upon receiving it, it was up and running right away.  I just had to put my gmail in and I was going, it walks you through a setup, that at the most is a minute long.  It has guest internet access, that I used to test it at first. The outlook app isn\u2019t very compatible to phone\/desktop version, it\u2019s kind of clunky.  It\u2019s harder to use. Mousepad works fine, no issues.  There\u2019s no right click. It\u2019s was easy to get used to the keypad, which was similar but not the same as my pc. Yahoo email isn\u2019t that compatible.  Salesforce is different but easy enough to use. Streaming is a bit choppy on action scenes or anything with lots of motion.  With the same wifi I don\u2019t have those issues with the PC laptop and my smart phone. No touch screen is part of what makes it a bit clunkier for the apps. It all depends on what your need is or not if this will work for you or not.  One way to think about a Chromebook is as an overgrown smart phone with a real keyboard and a bigger screen. I found I\u2019ve been using it more and more, almost every day.","This is my son's review: I currently use this as my college laptop. I also have an Asus ROG GL702VI that I used to use but it is a little heavy and bulky to pack and transport everyday (absolutely great gaming laptop if you're looking for one). This Lenovo Chromebook though is very convenient to carry and lasts all day. The FHD screen makes creating presentations and related activities easy since its easier to tell if something looks wrong. The chassis is much firmer feeling than other Chromebooks I've used. Some other ones I've tried feel cheaply built and feel like they will break if I breathe on them too hard. The only real complaint I have is with the amount of USB ports. You get one USB type-c and one \"regular\" USB port. Now for most people this may not be an issue, but in my college career it has caused a number of inconveniences in transferring data and the like, I work as a GRA so the data that I have to work with is different than what most students would be working with since I have to go out and gather it in some cases from many people. I would really like to give this five stars but the USB issues push it out of the five star range for me; HOWEVER, if all you're going to do is browse the web, make google docs, and maybe the occasional spreadsheet I would say that it is definitely a five star product.","Considering the price, it's really quite a good deal.  I wouldn't use it as my primary computer for heavy duty tasks or if I needed to multi-task.  But it works well as a secondary laptop.  I use it primarily for web browsing.  It seems to perform just fine when i watch YouTube or Amazon Prime videos.  I can keep multiple tabs open in the browser and it doesn't lag at all.  It boots up super fast and the battery life is quite good (roughly 7-10 hours, didn't really time it precisely).  The screen quality is not great but it's pretty good considering the cost. The biggest drawback of course is that you're tightly integrated with Google's ecosystem.  As a longtime Windows user, I find that to be rather limiting, which is why I still have a Window laptop as my primary computer.  There are too many things you can't do on a Chromebook, or can only do in a much more limited fashion.  But for many everyday tasks like web-surfing or online shopping it's perfectly capable.  It's big enough to not feel like the screen is cramped but also small and light enough to throw into a bag and not feel bulky or heavy.","If you want a sub par computer experience, here you go.  This seems something you'd buy for your child in school. Had to buy a mouse to even start using it because the track pad is a nightmare trying to scroll. Your limited to what you can download onto it. Left my computer closed and the battery died for the first time owning it for two months, after it turns on you must set things up all over again. It redownloads all apps you had but after but there not working. Also after it erased all my saved info for logging into amazon prime and amazon prime thinking logging into my google account where they were saved would recover them(nope). Battery dies expect recovering alot not sure if youll have the same problems but its only two months old. You have a extra level of security but it seems to lose value in every other aspect. Even on sale i would not buy this again unless for a child.","Screen is low-end - good resolution, but not very deep blacks, bad angle viewing. Case itself is nice, I like the slight dimples for grip. WIFI for some reason seems very slow, or could be the processor.  Seems to struggle to first start video streams, occasionally disconnects from paired Chromecast.  However, love how Chromecast support is a prominent feature. User switching not super quick. I like the pairing with your phone to unlock the Chromebook, but you still need to type in your Google acct password the first time after boot. Battery recharges fairly quickly.","The pointer and pull down tab on the side is very unresponsive and hard to control. Sometimes it takes many hovering attempts to get the tab to appear. Also when you try to copy a sentence it's inaccurate and again not crisp. This is the poorest designed laptop I have owned. Will definitely buy Acer or Asus in the future. Way better.","I can't connect to my wireless . Why?","It is a very S L O W laptop. The only uptight was the battery. I returned it."],"7":["Brand new right out of the box the computer is slower than the 10 year old computer I was replacing it with.

Spend a little more and get something better.","Easy set-up and touchscreen is a good feature.  Con:  processor is rather slow.","I was nervous to buy a computer off of amazon but it has worked out.

HP customer service was awful and said my day old computer was out of warranty.

Good size, light weight and key touch makes typing a breeze. Touch screen response is good too. Great value for the money. Screen quality is crisp and clear. I have owned many HP laptops and this one makes me very happy!","This product did not arrive in working condition. The unopened, seemingly new box included a stick-on label saying \"Professionally Upgraded from Brand New Unit,\" which leads me to believe it is not a true OEM product. Turning on the computer for the first time opened the Startup Repair screen. I used it to reset the computer but when that process completed I could not log in. It did not give me the opportunity to establish a user name or password. It did not take me through the familiar Windows 10 first steps at all (select time zone, etc.). Additionally, it arrived with an expired warranty. Per the HP Support Assistant, the warranty started on 8\/31\/19 and ended 10\/4\/19. But I purchased this \"new\" computer on 11\/25\/19. I feel misled and cheated by the seller. I next used the HP software included in the computer to install (reinstall) Windows 10. This process and the previous reset took hours to complete but it got the machine running as one would expect a new one to run. A chat with the advertised Amazon technical support was useless. All he wanted to do was have me return the product. I don't know what experience others have had with this model but mine was less than ideal.","Very SLOW right out of the box with nothing installed.  Sometimes this thing is unusable.  Goes dead every few hours even plugged in.","The first time it was turned on again after setup, it starting blaring a klaxon sound and essentially shouting out warnings about data loss, identity theft, and not turning it off.  Contacted HP who informed me that actual laptop had been purchased long ago. This product was NOT new, potentially not truly from HP, and could not even be turned off. Sound effects only ended after the battery was removed.  Amazon rep was great, but this product was horrible.","Returned. Terrible!","Slow to boot,sold out of the box in selective startup.

This time the repair included the removal of the installed SSD and replaced it with a 500gb HDD, the same configuration that was initially installed on this model.  I asked NEXIPC if they would at least  refund The $100 I paid for the SSD  and they refused.  I will also add that company will not answer their phone's, recording always says that their system is down for repair's and says to use their email to contact them.

After winning your prize, you went home and realized that it was still not a good deal.  This laptop is almost in that category, though the build quality keeps it above water. It is important to start by discussing Windows 10 S.  It is a very restricted version of Windows 10 that allows only official apps to be installed, like the Edge web browser and Microsoft Office, plus restricts some multitasking.  There are different reasons for it to exist, including corporate\/business use, to prevent unauthorized apps and avoid viruses.  It is also reportedly aimed at low end devices, being a lightweight version of the operating system more in line with a Chromebook.  This was my first experience with it, so I went in with an open mind... Everything seemed laggy and slow.  Isn't Windows 10 S supposed to be fast?  Sometimes a new computer is downloading and installing updates in the background, which makes it feel slow.  I checked and the computer was up to date.  The internet on my home Wifi, which works fine for everything else, was spotty.  The web browser would sometimes work slowly and other times not at all.  I quickly realized, also, that nearly everything I do on a computer is not accessible in Windows 10 S.  I browse the web in the Brave browser, which I couldn't install.  I watch movies in VLC.  So, I decided to \"upgrade\" to standard Windows 10 home, which is free, but the page for that kept stalling out. After giving the laptop a day off and taking it to work to try a different network on the older band (802.11g), Windows successfully switched off of S mode.  Annoyingly, I was required to use a Microsoft account to do that.  I checked and suddenly there were a ton of updates that I could install.  After doing so, the laptop was 500% faster, even if it was still on the slower side.  It also worked fine on my home network.  Do not believe the warnings that pop up about it slowing the computer down to switch.  I also went into power settings and turned off GPU throttling, which is a trick hardware makers play to give better battery life estimates at the cost of performance.  After downloading my preferred browser and software, I was able to browse the web and stream video fine.  I tried using the HDMI port, but it would not allow me to use the monitor.  Some glitch seems to happen, which may be related to the monitor having HDR support.  Normally, a computer that does not support HDR will just output non-HDR and it will work fine, but something strange was happening with the settings vanishing.  When that failed after a lot of tinkering, I tried Miracast (wireless display casting) and that actually worked with just a little lag, but it cuts out after maybe 20 minutes each time. The screen is very outdated.  Apart from the lower resolution, which I can live with, the viewing angles require very direct aiming of the screen at the viewer.  If I try to look at the screen when I am standing up, it looks all washed out.  Coming out in 2019, this is not acceptable on even a cheap laptop. Overall build quality, for the low price, is not bad at all.  It has a business laptop look that is not offensive and is more sturdy than some in this price range.  The charger is the traditional block type rather than the handy USB-C.  There are no USB-C ports at all. As many faults as this laptop has, it could be worth purchasing at a very low price, rather than the current pretty low price.  If you just need some light browsing (not on a monitor or a good screen) and can deal with the headaches of the OS, I could see it having merit.","ORDERED THIS ITEM 10NOV2019  ARRIVED NEXT DAY SET IT UP SHORTLY AFTER ... STOPPED WORKING 23NOV2019 .... TOTAL FAILURE RETURNING FOR FULL REFUND. I WORK FROM HOME AND NEED EQUIPMENT I CAN TRUST","Bought it for my 19yr son for school. havent had any complaints from him, so it must be fine.","It's small enough to fit where we need it....good speed, sound and clear screen quality.","Grand Daughter loves it","Bought as a gift","Just what i needed","A great laptop computer. I like the wight and the size.","When I started using this laptop, I was really looking for a laptop for school and work.  I wanted a no-frills, cheapish machine that would be able to run Microsoft Word, a few tabs in a browser, and some very light programming and CAD work. This laptop is able to do so, but only by the skin of its teeth.  It must be noted that it comes with Windows S, a locked operating system somewhat reminiscent of Chrome OS, where non-certified apps are restricted, and the laptop's performance is thus protected from strain.  The moment I had the laptop set up, I reverted it to normal Windows 10 Home and that is when the seams started to show. From startup to shut down, no matter what I am asking of the CPU, the Intel Celeron N4000 remains at 100% load.  It is chugging\u2026one hundred percent of the time.  RAM usage sits at around 80%, regardless of task or program in use.  There are noticeable delays when trying to open programs or browser tabs, forget CAD work.  This may be partially my fault, since the laptop is designed for a Windows S environment, but an outdated CPU tied to 4 GB of RAM will always struggle, regardless of the environment.  HP may have tried to alleviate this by giving the laptop a very low-quality screen, where even normal text is often slightly pixelated. The 64 eMMC storage is fine\u2026if you are using some cloud service for the majority of your storage (the laptop comes with one year of 1 TB of OneDrive storage).  Don\u2019t expect to store movies or install many programs on this laptop. A mark in this laptop's favor is the three USB-A ports, one of which is USB 2.0 and the other two of which are 3.1 Gen 1.  It also has a full-sized HDMI port, which I have already used many times in the office.  It has no USB-C port, unlike most modern laptops, but, somewhat hilariously, neither does a single projector or TV in my office.  For better or for worse, they all still have HDMI cords and I have been asked many times to use my underpowered laptop over co-workers modern workhorses simply because of that HDMI port! I don\u2019t mind this laptop, with its huge bezels, bad camera, and outdated Wi-Fi antenna.  I have had to drastically change my expectations, but I never worry about it getting beat up on my commute or damaged when I drop my backpack to the ground. It does what I ask of it, barely, and that is just fine.  Oh, and it will be the laptop I take with me on my next overseas project.  If it gets destroyed or lost... I won't cry too hard.","First of all, I LOVE HP products and have stuck with them over the past 10 years, as I\u2019ve had many of the other big brands which have seriously disappointed. Last year, I purchased a similarly priced HP laptop for a friend who had never used a computer and wanted to learn. For the price it was adequate, but looked childish and was housed in aqua blue plastic. It worked fine, not a huge amount of power, and was fairly slow, but I figured for the low price, was good enough to start out with it. The difference between that model and this one is immense. This one, looks like a business laptop, it\u2019s super lightweight and even though it has only 4GB of Ram, it\u2019s fast enough. This is also the perfect Laptop for my retired Husband who really doesn\u2019t do much computing. He sends the odd Email, checks sports scores, may stream a rare Netflix show, and plays solitaire. He also spills drinks into expensive laptop keyboards, and renders them \u201cfried\u201d. This is not a workhorse like my current HP Envy, but as a 1st Laptop for a child, inexperienced user, messy Husband, or more Elderly person who wants to learn, it\u2019s a perfect stepping stone.","Love it","Super lightweight, fast and I love the design of it. Camera could have clearer picture but regardless this computer is great for everything else and it Bluetooth connects to anything!","great computer the only dislike I have with is that its a lot of apps they you cant get with this computer.","I asked if this was touch screen they said it was got it and not touch screen very disappointed","I'm kind of frustrated, here.  The hardware aspect of the laptop is good and it's comfortable to use.  Frankly I think it reflects well on HP!  But my big issue with this machine is the operating system that comes with it.  Windows 10 S is TERRIBLE.  This laptop arrived just before I went on a trip and I wasn't able to bring it along because it required an active internet connection to set it up.  (I didn't know if the hotel would have wifi)  That is just infuriating, you should NEVER require an internet connection just to start a device like this.  Seriously, you HAVE TO REGISTER AN ACCOUNT WITH MICROSOFT JUST TO LOG IN TO THIS THING. Another issue I have with this operating system is that I use Chrome.  I mean I really use Chrome as in I log in to it and it manages my bookmarks.  A machine like this is not likely to be the primary machine, so picking a browser like Chrome makes sense, all the syncing etc is automatic.  I went to go get Chrome and Windows 10 S was like \"NOPE.  You can use Edge, though!\" Seriously, it reminded me of that time AT&T told me I can avoid a data-overage if I just don't use the service.  If that's not frustrating enough, I used Edge to log into Gmail where I was met with lotsa \"you should download Chrome!\"... meaning even the sites I visit aren't aware I'm on a different OS than Windows 10 and... just yuck yuck yuck.  I got this machine to replace a Chromebook and frankly I regret it.  I thought it would be more versatile but the limitations they put on what can be run is, for me, insurmountable.  I can use it, but I'm having to compromise a good deal more than I had expected to.  I mean, the specs suggest it'll be slow,  and that's okay!  I just didn't expect it to flat out deny software installations. One would expect that a Chromebook would have more limitations than this machine, after owning one for a while I'm not inclined to agree, however your mileage may vary. I hate giving this machine a bad review because I think HP did a very nice job with it's design and construction.  None of my criticisms at ALL are due to any shortcomings HP has.  My complaints are 100% about Microsoft.  Seriously, if I could put Windows 7 on this machine it'd be FAR better!!! I would advise steering in the direction of a Chromebook over this machine.  I mean unless you know that Windows 10 S will be fine for your web usage (like.. if you use Edge already) this machine will be quite satisfactory to you.  But if you've never heard of Windows 10 S before there's a very good chance you'd be happier if just kept looking","The good: comes with access to office for a year. The bad: the rest of it. While I understand that this is a cheap laptop and in no ways was I looking to be blown away by its performance in any category, I did expect it to run \u201cwell\u201d out of the box. Not fast, not great, not good, just \u201cwell\u201d and it fell short of that. If I wanted to boot into safe mode I would, however this version of windows does it for you at the expense of using any application that\u2019s not in the Microsoft store. It\u2019s easy enough to get out of, but how is that a feature. From the get go loading web pages was painfully slow which made this always connected laptop an even bigger joke because I can\u2019t imagine trying to wait for a large file to load as it took too long for a web page to load. Save the money and get something decent instead","This little machine is pretty quick on the uptake. I don't need for it to be a gaming machine, or to replace my regular computer. What I want it for is to take with me on travels, because it doesn't weigh a fraction of the MacBook Pro, and is way more functional than the iPad. When I'm lying in bed, it's nice to pull up a comic or a book or a YouTube video on the iPad. When I'm at home, and I have a desk, the MacBook is comfortable and easy to use. However, when I travel, I don't want to take either one with me. The MacBook is too heavy, and the iPad is extremely limited in scope to what it can do. This little guy lets me connect a drive to the USB port, and watch my movies. I have a full sized keyboard to chat with my friends when I watch a Twitch stream. I can remote into my office machine reasonably well. The battery lasts a good long time. If I'm just watching movies or something, I'll turn off the WiFi, and let the movies roll. Otherwise, even with the WiFi and Bluetooth turned on, I can get some good long battery life out of this guy. One more benefit: the power cable plugs into the right side of the machine. I'm left handed, and this is very nice to have. The volume of the speakers is plenty loud for me to listen to audio at home. The screen resolution is nice, and it shows up a Netflix stream with no trouble at all, and nice crisp resolution. Again, I don't have a ton of software installed. I threw on VLC player to play my movies, and the Chrome browser for web browsing. Aside from that, I keep things pretty dumbed down. In fact, I went through and \/removed\/ a bunch of the software that came pre-installed. That's the one gripe I had. Unlike my Mac, this machine came with a bunch of garbage that I'll never use. I don't need an antivirus, because I'm using Windows Defender and not going onto dodgy websites. I don't need a trial version of other random stuff either, because whatever software I need, I already own, and I don't expect this one to try and replace that. It's my one and only gripe, that it took me a \/while\/ to set this up to my liking, because I had to remove so much garbage, and turn off so many things that auto start with the machine.","This laptop is made to be a small, lightweight portable, \u201ccloud\u201d computer. It has solid hp quality, so it feels and looks professional. The actual computing power is limited, only 4GB RAM and a limited version of Windows 10. With the limited version of Windows you can\u2019t download lots of add on apps, so be prepared to use this for very minimal activities. If all you want to use is Microsoft Office products (word, excel, PowerPoint); surf Facebook, write a few emails, and maybe watch Netflix on the road, then this computer works. Just understand that you can\u2019t add a bunch of software or other features to it. The battery life seemed reasonable 6-8 hours (although I didn\u2019t really test it fully).  The screen is ok for basic simple use but don\u2019t expect high resolution. I would buy this as a second travel laptop or maybe for a very young child junior high or less. For the price and simplicity, it is does the job.","Nice laptop for school or surfing the web, its kinda basic. The 14-inch body is thin and it's light at about 3 pounds . The only drawback is it  Does not have a C-D rom , so I am unable to put my games on it.  The screen has realistic colors, but it isn't super bright.  It doesn't get  hot but doesn't have a fan and the battery lasts a long time.  Keyboard isn't back-lit so no in the dark typing.  It features plenty of ports for various inputs.Powering the computer up was ok and only took a few moments to load up to the start screens. After a month It does not turn on at all.  I left it plugged up for hours and will not turn on.  total letdown.  I would not purchase anymore products from this suppler.","I have had several laptops over the years and this laptop is by far the fastest bootup I have ever seen. I was expexting a lower quality laptop due to the price point but, very impressed with the capabilities it can perform. I use this in my work truck on a daily basis now and can perform all the duties that I require of it. I am a tradesman and basically run my business on this laptop. I don't think I would try using for hardcore gaming but as a good business laptop YES all day long! I may even say that I run my Fantasy football league from it as well. You cant go wrong with the price point. This computer would also be good for college.","I gave this to my son who is in college and this lightweight notebook is perfect for him because it is inexpensive yet works very well. 64 GB is the perfect amount of space for someone who mainly uses word processing and other programs that don't gobble up storage and memory and the display is sharp and clear. I like that it comes with 365 but with the price you pay (so low!) for this notebook, it is worth purchasing the student edition so there are no mishaps with papers not being saved, etc. This notebook is incredibly light and he really likes the cool black color that makes it stand out from the typical drab gray that notebooks usually come in. Because it is only 4 GB of RAM, it isn't the fastest machine in the world but for simple computing it is more than sufficient. A student would love this, so would a frequent traveler who can work from a cloud, etc that doesn't need all the bells and whistles. I am considering purchasing another for my nephew depending on how that first report card looks because it is that great of a deal!","Pros: The battery life is good-- if you are watching Netflix or videos you this laptop battery survived a 10 hour airplane trip of pretty constant use. It's so  small at 13\" and light weight at 3.17 lbs, it's the perfect choice for taking with you. The price is affordable and beats a lot of the competition for this size range. 3  usb ports and a HDMI port as well a memory card reader port Good homework computer for tweens to teens Cons: 4 GB memory is half of what I have on my Macbook, but in the age of cloud it\u2019s workable. Poor screen resolution Slow processing speed S (security) mode prevents you from using anything other than official apps.","Is  A Great Kids, Travel or Media Laptop As Long As..... you understand what you purchased...you can not expect this to be a gamers laptop nor you will be using this to stream 4K and HD is pushing it.... (By the way, while technically is HD, is 720 not full HD) BUT... if you want a very light travel laptop... want some that you can hand to your kid to work not as a toy...this is it. Battery life, well...to get the max 14 or 11 hours claimed...you better have all off and in low power mode...I managed to get about 8hrs top watching netflix SD resolution.","I received this HP laptop for my son to use for school he is a junior in high school and it works well enough for his school work and he says he can watch a movie or things like that but of course it\u2019s nothing like his gaming pc for speed or space. But it Is lightweight and perfect for business use (school, travel, etc.) as with anything it is always good to remember what your buying the product for and this laptop is not super fast or won\u2019t hold large amounts of games, apps but it will work well enough for school work, emails,etc","If you are looking for the cheapest and lightest new laptop you can buy, this is an alright option. It uses an Intel celeron, which means that there are many modern programs that wont work on it because it's incompatible with the processor. Also the screen was very washed out upon arrival and took a lot of fiddling to get it looking reasonable. When closed, the screen half doesn't line up 100% with the keyboard half on the one I recieved. As a basic word processor and internet access, its good. Its very light to carry."],"9":["Why did I buy this? I was looking for a laptop that I can use for work, travels easy, but can afford me some game time when I am on the road.  Budget wasn\u2019t really an issue, but I wanted to make sure I was getting the most value for what I spent.  I do not do intensive work applications on it just email, excel, general surfing etc.  I am not a competitive gamer, so getting that extra millisecond of response time was not a concern but I wanted something that could handle current games and most games that will come out over the next couple of years. What I considered \/ compared it too? GPU \u2013 GTX 1650 \u2013 this thing rocks, most comparisons were to the older (but still capable) 1050i and other variations.  I wanted the newest I could get for the cost.  So this was the bench mark of my search. Processor \u2013 9th gen i5 \u2013 I really wanted to get a 9th gen i7 but, most of the ones that had it only had the 1050 series of graphics card, and as I stated above that\u2019s what I really valued most. NOTE: Lenovo DOES make a version of this with a gen 9 i7, it is not available (at the time of writing this) on Amazon. It IS available on Lenovo\u2019s website for about $180 more than this unit (on sale for $270 off ATM), but it comes with a smaller SSD.  I know its easier to replace an SSD than a GPU (basically impossible on a laptop like this) but between the cost difference and not having to hassle with adding an SSD right when I received it, that\u2019s why I decided against that route. NOTE: the benchmark testing on a gen 9 i5 vs i7 were very close in most tests, while future proofing your purchase is a good idea, it didn\u2019t look like a big enough difference (4 cores 8 threads on the 5 vs 6 cores 12 threads on the 7) to move me to spend more. NOTE: This laptop model might be an Amazon exclusive because I could not locate it on the Lenovo web site. Monitor refresh \u2013 60Hz \u2013 this was a tough one for me, there are some laptops that have the 9th gen i7, 16gb ram and the 1650 graphics card with 144Hz monitor (and there is a difference, just watch some youtube videos on it) but that cost difference was about $450.  For the games I play (will get to that in a second), the look, and the weight of the product, I just couldn\u2019t pull the trigger on the extra costs. RAM \u2013 8GB \u2013 documents state that you can upgrade the single 8GB stick to 16GB. 16GB DDR4 is about 70 bucks, if I get into a game that is giving me performance issues, I am ok with that upgrade cost. NOTE: Lenovo says you should use an authorized tech to upgrade your RAM\/SSD or you might void the warranty.  I am not sure of the legality of that due to the right to self-repair, but I have done enough that it doesn\u2019t concern me, your views\/value my differ from mine in this respect. 512gig SSD \u2013 I definitely wanted an SSD, boot speeds etc are totally worth it. 512 means I can fit about 6+ of today\u2019s modern games on it comfortably.  I am ok with that for now.  It does have an extra 2.5\u201d bay for another SSD (I have a 1TB from my old laptop so if I get to the point where I need it, it won\u2019t cost me anything extra, obviously your experience will differ from mine in that additional cost).  The extra bay is nice because you do not have to reload the OS etc, you can add the drive and increase your storage easily.  The NOTE above on the RAM upgrade applies here too. The Look \u2013 As I mentioned I will be using this for work too, this is as discrete of a \u201cgaming\u201d laptop as I have seen.  I did not want flashy lights or gaming brand logos on the cover.  I have the power to game; I don\u2019t need or want to flaunt it in my day job interacting with customers. Keyboard backlight \u2013 has 3 settings, off, low, high.  I play in a pretty dark room and the low setting was perfect to let me see while not blinding my peripheral vision. Heat \u2013 this is not a loud laptop (fans); I have been gaming on laptops for 10 years an have had my fair share of jet engines.  This doesn\u2019t appear to be one of those.  It does get warm, but nothing of concern or that would burn to the touch. Battery life \u2013 I haven\u2019t tested it yet completely (will update when I do) but in \u201ceconomy\u201d mode (not using the 1650 graphics card) it looks to last 5+ hours, the description says 9 hours but I doubt that, still its more than enough for when I can\u2019t plug in.  Running with the 1650 turned on and gaming I would get around 2 hours. Bloat \u2013 amazingly it didn\u2019t come with much on it that I had to remove.  MacAfee and a Lenovo thing, that\u2019s about it. What games do I play on it? No Man\u2019s Sky Beyond \u2013 Played on high settings with no issues\/lag\/clipping at all WoW \u2013 Ultra settings with no issues (obviously its an older games graphics wise) Overwatch \u2013 Ultra Settings with no issues As I play and test more games ill update this\u2026.. 9\/29\/19 EDIT - Borderlands 3 - 30 FPS on Ultra, dialed back to medium and was more than great for my average gamer needs. 11\/30\/19 EDIT - Thrown a ton of games at this over the past few months.  Basically anything made before 2018 you can run at max with no issues.  Most newer games (2019 releases) will run just fine at med\/high settings. What about the backlight\/bleeding reports? Ill knock on wood, I have not seen bleeding on the edges for darker games, or I might just not be noticing it.  backlight\/monitor darkness, again, I have not experienced this, and I hope I don\u2019t.  I get that everyone has defects and a % of DOA product.  Everyone\u2019s mileage will differ on this I guess.","Unboxed earlier today and about 3 hours into use the backlight suddenly went out and unable to turn back on. Went through all the typical fixes such as restarting, adjusting brightness, adjust refresh rate, replace battery. Props to Lenovo for making me pay for shipping to repair my three hour old laptop. Guess i'll stay clear away from Lenovo products moving forward.","Because this computer, was seriously great while I had it up and operational. I thought it was my dream laptop like the other users have said. Unfortunately, barely a week into use, my laptop froze up on me while I was browsing the internet, I forced shut it down, and it never turned back on. Did every fix in the book for hours on end but nothing worked. Now, I have to return it. I'm very disappointed, I've never had a laptop cut out on me so fast in all the years I've had laptops.","Overall decent laptop for the $700 range, you get what you paid for. Battery life is ok if you put everything to lowest. The single channel RAM is a turn off, if this was a double RAM channel then it would be a 5\/5.","This laptop has very nice specs for the price however there are things that bothered me.  The first being the trackpad and the second being the image quality.  The trackpad does not use windows precision which is far superior to what is being offered here.  Regarding image quality, the colors feel very washed out and regardless of how hard I tried I was unable to replicate the image quality of my pc monitor and previous laptop.  In addition to this, the laptop I received has an issue with the backlight showing through the top of the screen which is very unappealing.  Aside from these stumbles, the laptop does an excellent job running music programs such as Digital Performer, Finale, and so on which is very nice, but again the track pad and the image quality really both me with this product.,","First off, performance on this laptop is great. The i5-9300h will pretty much be able to do anything except for the heaviest tasks, while the GTX 1650 can handle a large variety of games, though the most graphics intense games will need medium to low settings. While there are only 8 GB of RAM, in my usage (internet browsing, college work, occasional gaming) that has never been a problem. Again, this isn't the absolute most powerful laptop, but it is probably far above average in performance. Battery life is surprisingly good for a gaming laptop, especially if you undervolt (which I did by -125 mV if you're interested), and it runs relatively cool as well, rarely going over 80 C. I personally really like the minimalist design, with blue accents instead of the \"gamer\" red, so this won't turn too many heads in a professional meeting. The screen bezels are relatively small too, and while apparently the color gamut is not the best, that either doesn't matter or isn't even apparent to me (in case you saw reviews criticizing this). Maybe if you're in graphic design, this might matter, though. The hinge is strong, and can bend all the way to 180 degrees. It's not a touchscreen laptop, but there are some uses, such as watching a video in bed or something. The system is also really slim for a gaming laptop, and easy to carry around, which is an excellent design choice. The build quality isn't the best, being mostly plastic, but it is still smooth to feel, so there is at least that. The keyboard isn't very clicky, and the travel distance is a little small. It takes a while to get used to, but eventually you may get used to it. The backlit keyboard is nice, though. The trackpad unfortunately uses garbage Synaptics drivers. I played around with the registry a bit to add a couple gestures, but coming from Windows Precision, the trackpad is definitely a massive downgrade from Precision for me. I tried installing Precision drivers, and they worked (excellently, I might add) temporarily, because I guess Windows update has something in place to really latch you on to Synaptics drivers. Although there are definitely some sacrifices made (including some that I haven't mentioned, such as needing to buy a separate cable if you want to add a hard drive or having only one slot for RAM), I think that on balance this laptop provides fantastic value for $680. In some areas you get what you pay for, but for $680 this laptop can do a lot more than others.","I wanted a lightning fast laptop. Boot time is super fast (I'd never go back to a mechanical hard drive). I can have so many windows open without it slowing down whatsoever. Backlit keyboard is bright and can be dimmed and turned off entirely. A few annoyances, bleeding\/blooming white light on top left edge of screen, quality control? -No optical drive and some would say who uses those anymore....well it's nice to be able to throw in a DVD if you're offline, but it's a gaming laptop, so that's probably not a concern for most. -No touch screen, but since it's for an elderly impatient recipient, that would add more confusion. Longevity may be a concern, since I've seen some reviews about quality. All in all decent for the price.","Though this is a \"gaming\" laptop, I bought it for work as a developer. The large amount of RAM and relatively powerful mobile processor allow me to run multiple docker instances or virtual machines without slowing down my work. Given the specs, the battery life is expectedly low - but honestly fairly decent for what you get. If you're not doing anything intensive it can easily last 3-4 hours. Linux compatibility is great as well - The hardware is all supported by current open source drivers as well - save for the dual head mode on the GPU, you will need to install the proprietary nvidia-driver-430 or newer if you'd like to use a secondary display along with the built in panel. My only major complaint is that the USB-C connection does NOT support HDMI over USB. It's only a Gen 1 USB 3.1 controller and outputs just 5Gbit\/s - far short of what's needed to drive a monitor or two. The built-in HDMI connection works just fine, but I'd have preferred the ability to use an all-in-one dock so it's a bit disappointing for a newer generation laptop to have such an old USB controller. All-in-all, a good budget buy if you need a powerful mobile workstation.","Is amazing laptop and performance gaming machine. Olso the design is very good build. I have owned, customized, and built a lot of computers over the past 30 years, and one trend is clear: laptops have become much more desirable for consumers today than desktop PCs. Today's computers all handle work and casual consumption very well and come in all sorts of forms and functions. Where power is still needed are hardcore gaming and professional work, such as photography, videography, and architectural drawings. SUMMARY: this Lenovo IdeaPad is a mid-range gaming laptop with the speedy power to perform heavy work, packaged in a sturdy, clean chassis. It presents a very good value for the money and is a nice upgrade over last year's model.","This laptop is not working! i bought this and want to power on but laptop no reaction. The charger get loudly signal and charging light not working! i live in Azerbaijan and return it with airfright shipping company to pay 90$. this seller send me deffective product which is not working! i dont recommend this seller and Laptop! Nobody buy this product!","Runs overwatch at epic settings at 100 fps, ultra league of legends settings at 120 really like it","This is the best laptop your gonna find for thd price..  Best Buy and places like that will sell this for $900. This computer is perfect for anything you need to do including gaming with fast high graphic Xbox games.. Also you can always add for RAM if needed but i don't see it.. Since its got the 9th gen processor I5 it is as fast as a 8th gen i7..  Its got incredible graphics and its a speedy laptop that seems to function like the speed of a good Mac!!!  A++++++ Ps.  I have laptops with 12 and 16gb ram that don't operate as fast as this with 8gb ddr4.","I never give bad reviews, but I probably used the computer for an hr. The screen will not turn on. Junk","The layout of the keyboard is irregular which leads to mistyping at least half the time.  Also, the touchpad is on the left side instead of the middle which causes issues with general usability (ie right clicking when you want to left click, but all the time).  I didn't bother trying to use it much before returning, but the battery did not last as long as I'd expect for a laptop of that size with minimal usage.  Also just a generally unattractive look and giant battery pack, which seems standard with all Lenovo laptops.","Best computer I've ever owned, except that the screen died in two months during the middle of graduate school and Amazon refused to help with my situation. I wouldn't buy this product again, or a computer from Amazon at all.","I've been using this machine for a little over two months and I must say this machine delivers excellent performance as advertised. The only thing I don't like about this is the display. It seems blury in my opinion and that may or may not be a hardware issue, however the display is not a complete killer as it works fairly well. I resolved by using the machine as a desktop and hooking up my ultrawide monitor via HDMI best move I ever made. All in all great buy with a few tweaks.","So far, Very silent. Extremely fast. Battery lasts at least 5 hours for average use. I have played GTA 5 and PUBG in medium-high settings with over 60 fps easy. I work on engineering programs, so far autocad, solidworks, matlab etc.. Not a single lag or problem. Runs so smooth. I am very pleased to have this laptop. It is the right choice for students, business and home users who wants to play high-end games on side without bad battery life.","Fit my price budget. Definitely able to run games well and on high settings. Compared this to my friend's Acer Nitro 5 and this definitely beats it. You will need a USB C hub if you want to connect your CD's and whatnot. Bought at $707, it dips here and there","about a week into ownership and very pleased.  Great price point with large SSD, Nvidia GTX card plenty potent for this old school gamer (single player Half-life, Bioshock, COH, Portal 2).  Great size, elegant looking machine, doesn't look like a \"boy racer\" laptop.  I like the plastic bottom tray as it's not too cold, and not too hot when on bare legs.  couldn't be happier.","I bought this for my daughter for doing graphic design \/ animation and for gaming.  Overall, she's very happy with the system.  It does occasionally lag when loading up software, but runs well once it's ready.  (She also runs multiple, intensive programs at one time, so part of it is her style of use.)","after less than two months it's just stuck with black screen and loud vent noise","Superb performance for its price, good screen quality, decent battery and the laptop is quite lightweight. The only problem is that the USB port is on the left, and it is a bit annoying when you have a wired, portable mouse.","Guys your not going to get a high quality gaming laptop at only about 800 dollars that can play the newest games at mas settings and 144 hz. Instead you should get this and be happy that you didn't have to spend so much. I think you should get this is your a student that's something powerful and would just like to have some gaming other times.","Me agrafo el funcionamiento y la velocidad de funcionamiento wl audio es bueno y con altaboses decentes y lo que no me agrada es el ruido que es al jugar juegos de alto rendimiento pero poniendo los audifionos se arregla","Plays everything you can think of at decent settings. Not the monster laptop you might want, but great for college life if you require a lot of memory for software applications, or have multiple projects open; it's good as well as just an overall gaming experience if you can't afford something mainstream like an ASUSROG.","I'm happy I bought this notebook, after installing all updated drivers and BIOS updates I can recommend this Notebook. I use it for work and occasionally playing a game.","Ive just started using this laptop and I give it a 100% in terms of value for your money, solid build, nice black colour, extremely fast charging and thermals are super cool for now.. not tested any games on it yet..but I give it a 100%","Great value. Handles light gaming with ease and is a better than average laptop.","It works good. It's only one problem for me that the fans are loud sometimes","Very fast and stylish and great quality","Perfect laptop for light\/medium gaming and general use, very happy with the purchase.","I like it, PERIOD....","Great Performance, Good Battery Life. Gets bit hot when playing games","Held higher than my expectations. Worth the price.","Very happy with this purchase!","Fast delivery, Great price.","Great laptop","Pros: 1) Extremely powerful. Nvidia 1650 graphics card and 8GB of RAM make for fast processing. Was able to simultaneously download 2 50GB games while watching Netflix. Was then able to play those games at 45-60FPS on high settings with no lag (Overwatch and Battlefield V). 2) Elegant. Design is discreet and simple; good for the professional adult who loves to game. No need to embarrass yourself by lugging around a machine that throws up green and red lights with its brand and logo plastered on the chassis. This is a laptop you wouldn\u2019t mind taking into the meeting room. 3) Privacy Shutter. A simple design add-in, but an appreciated one nonetheless. It is a physical piece of plastic that slides shut over your webcam, so no gimmicks there. 4) Connectivity. Offers an ethernet port, HDMI port, 2 USB ports, headphone jack, and USB-C. More than enough for my needs. If you need more, you can easily get adapters. 5) Matte screen. By this I mean that the screen is not glossy or prone to glares like OLED or LCD screens are. It\u2019s much softer on the eyes, and your screen won\u2019t be blocked out by the sun or if you are next to a light source. Cons: 1) Storage. This only offers 500gb, which is very small compared to the standard of 1TB that most laptops offer now. However, this is easily fixed with an external hard drive that can be bought from $20-$45. 2) Matte Screen. I realize that I listed this in my pros; that is because due to its anti-glare properties, the colors have suffered a bit when compared to OLED or LCD screens. However, the amount of color diminishment is very low; I\u2019d say this would matter much only if you are a serious content creator. Otherwise, it makes no difference to the average PC user. 3) Mousepad sensitivity. It is low compared to other laptops, such as the Microsoft Surface Pro or the MacBook Series, so that may throw some users off. This is easily fixed by downloading a free program called Windows Precision Tracker. Otherwise, a wireless mouse is just fine. Conclusion: Overall, this is a very attractive laptop that certainly delivers on its power and speed. It is perfectly balanced between being a work and gaming laptop. Lenovo has really poured their efforts into this laptop, and I am a lifelong Lenovo customer after experiencing this machine.","First AC adapter input was 100-240 volt so you can use it out in USA. I am using it in Mongolia 220 volt AC. Laptop was really liked smooth fast and light weigth. On lowest brigthness display light complatly turn off and you can listen music in darkness by dolby atmos. Now i will test games on this nice thing. Single channel ram slot is 1 weakness but for me 8 gb is enough","Great Laptop. JK I haven't even bought it. For some reason, Amazon let me put a customer review without me having bought it haha, makes no sense but oh well.","I've used Lenovo devices for a long time, I was exited to buy this one, and let me tell you I'm not dissapointed at all, it is a great computer, really light weight and with a powerful hardware, it's probably the best computer i've ever owned. Also it's price is great, you get a top hardware device for really low price. I recomend it if you're looking for an upgrade or just want to play some games somewhere besides your house.","Great laptop in its price range."],"10":["This laptop has one of the worst TFT panel I have ever seen, there is literally no proper viewing angles. You will get distortion looking straight on. The monitor was poorly calibrated with WAY too much gamma, luckily adjusting this with Windows is trivial, I will get back to 'S Mode' later on. You will not be able to use this monitor for watching movies with a lot of dark scenes. If you are looking at the screen dead on the outer regions of black will be distorted to LIGHT grey. The keyboard is decent, the 10-key is a bit difficult with the keys not being the right size on the side. The button press is tactile and usable and the feel is fine enough for typing blind, which you shouldn't have to do since the keyboard is back-lit. The touch pad is okay, it's actually a bit too sensitive, the lower corners can be used as buttons but I would greatly prefer physical buttons like on the current Lenovo brand laptops. The touch pad has a fingerprint reader in the top right corner which interferes with the operation of the touch pad but at least the fingerprint reader is fast! The speakers are complete garbage, they have no semblance to actual sounds and it sounds like you are listening to a cellphone speaker through a wooden door. They are completely unusable for anything at all, do not buy this laptop if you enjoy playing anything on your speakers. The webcam is usable, but it's nothing to write home about, capping out at 720p\/30fps it will feel like a power-point presentation more than a video feed on any video chat. The sound is about the same as phone quality. If you do video chats frequently, find another laptop. Back to windows and 'S Mode'. Windows is pre-installed, it had some of the latest updates already so it was recently installed. It doesn't have much bloatware, but having Skype installed is too much already. The \"type\" of Windows that is installed is called 'S Mode' which is basically a locked down completely restrictive version of Windows. You can't even download Chrome from the web you have to get it from the Microsoft store - Chrome being the first app I install on any Windows computer -. I removed 'S Mode' almost immediately. The laptop has 4Gb of non-removable memory and 4Gb of replaceable memory which is nice even though it's only single channel. The laptop is made from a plastic frame which I actually don't mind, it makes the laptop reasonably light, but it gives it a cheap experience. Opening the lid for example requires two hands or a technique, both of which is actually mildly inconvenient. Summary: The good: Decent keyboard and touch pad, fast loading web pages If you like a want a PC for viewing Netflix\/media at home with no headphones, look somewhere else. If you want a PC for viewing Wikipedia\/news then this will be decent but there are cheaper laptops that can do that better. If you have a fancy IPS monitor, you will hate this laptop. If you are even thinking about gaming, the answer is no. Seeing as this laptop has such limited uses with the horrible screen and speakers, I cannot give this laptop a better review that 3 stars. It's only purpose is to view webpages and basic coffee-shop work.","The SSD and RAM  are upgradeable but it does not have any empty slots for anything. When opening the case there are no hidden screws. It has a single stick of DDR4 RAM It uses a PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD Pictured are the upgraded SSD and RAM","Honestly, the laptop is great! I did buy a 1x8GB kit of ddr4 sodimm 2400mhz cl16 ram to upgrade the memory on the laptop from the original 8GB, and I made a quick discovery that the laptop comes with 4GB of RAM soldered onto the motherboard, thus you can only replace the other stick of RAM in the populated RAM slot that has a 4GB stick in it. So I now have 12GB of RAM on my f512d ryzen model. Furthermore, the SSD that came included with my model used a Kingston 256GB SSD, leaving one open slot for a 2.5 inch Sata SSD or HDD. The battery life lasts about 2-3 hours on a near-full charge, and since my college classes require atleast a 1.5 hours of charge per class, I could dim down the display for less battery usage and possibly the keyboard backlights, but I'd say it's a win either way. Overall, the screen is IPS and beautiful, the entire system  feels snappy and responsive, and I can actually run 3D applications on it without it bugging out like my last Samsung i3 laptop from 2013. Love AMD's new product lineup and I hope this helps anyone else looking to buy this laptop. UPDATE: Sadly, my unit didn't last long. I just began using my 3-d softwares and new code IDE's for C++ and this thing blue-screened every 5 minutes or so. Sometimes I was lucky and it'd work nicely but just today, the drive slowed down to a near halt and as windows tried to repair or reset it, it just died. I now boot into the bios everytime with no storage or boot-detection of the ssd. What a brilliant time for it to die. Also for battery life, turning off the keyboard backlighting litterally gave me 9+ hours of battery-life. Sad to see it go.","looking for a great affordable laptop that can be used for school and personal use? This is the one.  It took like like 4 days to settle on what laptop to buy but I finally figured out this one would be it. There's not much youtube video reviews about this laptop but it is worth buying. Even if you aren't going to college, this is a great laptop for personal use. The backlit keyboards are a life saver for late night usage. The only problem (not the laptop itself) is windows 10, it took a while to install chrome because it was only allowing me to use Microsoft Edge browser but I figured it out it got chrome. If you need any help with this, just reply to me.","The screen quality ruins this. Washed out and gray at every angle. Absolutely terrible","Bought this laptop for my wife, to replace her old Core I5 desktop. This is a superb laptop, very fast with its 5-core Ryzen processor. Swapped SSD with a 500GB and bumped memory to 16M and this thing is considerably faster. Also, this thing isn't loaded up with bloatware, so it runs very well right out of the box. I reimaged it with Win10 Pro instead of Home, for more security. Bought a USB-C dock station to clean up the cables, discovered that the USB-C port doesn't push external video. Be aware of that if you intend to use the USB port for external video.","very good laptop , very stylish and lightweight","Overall review is that this laptop is good however I do have some issues with it. I will be using this more or less for school and web surfing here and there. Not good if you would like to have some games. When I bought this I also bought a extra 8 gb ram. Looking at the reviews and pictures, most do say that it has an extra slot for another ram. This particular model did not. If you search in the reviews, there are some question that is answered by ASUS Support and one that says \"this unit can support a max of 16 GB of RAM. It has 2 slots, 1 installed with 8 GB of RAM and 1 slot left open for an additional 8 GB.\" Mine did not. Looking at the ASUS website, the specs  says \"4 GB DDR4 2400MHz SDRAM Onboard memory, 1 x SO-DIMM socket for expansion, up to 12 GB SDRAM\". Here is the address : asus(dot)com\/us\/Laptops\/ASUS-VivoBook-15-F512DA\/specifications\/ Don't fully trust the review answers. Take it with a grain of salt and look on the actual website for the model specs. Screen brightness could be better. On the brightest setting while plugged in, I rate it a 6. Was expecting a 8 at most. Battery life as of writing this, 8-17-2019 12:00pm, says 7.5 hrs at 83% battery. Probably not accurate but seems to be doing well so far and as said earlier will more or less be used for school and web surfing.","Received this and after using it for 2 days, was overheating and had to turn on the very loud emergency fan, screen kept blinking black throughout use from day 1, websites like linkedIn were working soo slowly...Not sure what it was but had to return it and very unsatisfied with this.","Disappointed that after much research and questions asked, the 256gb SSD model version comes much different than the 128GB 1TB HDD model. Reason being only having 1 dual rank slot for RAM in the 256GB SSD Model capping this device to only 16GB of Ram max capacity where as others say its upgradable to 32GB with open Dual slots. Wished more information was provided about this product for the consumer by ASUS and seller. Although it is similar, they are not identical. The F512DA seems to be less upgradable friendly than the  F510ua model. If Asus will take back their 8gb Memory stick and provide me at 16GB at half the cost I will happily give 5 stars, otherwise if one wants to upgrade their ram memory, you'll be left with an extra stick of ram as a paper weight.","Screen is not the best but still workable and understandable at this price point. But this laptop gets filtered up in search while looking for USB-C connectivity, which in my opinion is a great way to reduce cable clutter and inconvenience associated with keeping chargers and display cables. But this laptop does not offer any of those functions through USB-C. Then what's the point of advertising and having USB-C.","Good computer for the money. However l sent an email to ASUS asking about maximum upgrade for ram and if there was a spot for an added hard drive. I was told it could be upgraded to 12GB and there is a slot to install an additional 4GB. If l wanted a larger hard drive l would have to replace the one currently installed. As you can see by the photos there is no slot to add RAM but there is a space for an additional hard drive. Even looking up the specs yourself online you are given incorrect information. I had it delivered to the Philippines and am not going to pay to send it back. It is a good computer for the price, my real issue was with ASUS not even being able to provide accurate information to upgrade. Something tells me it can probably be upgraded to 16 but have to replace the currently installed RAM.","Laptop works fine, but the keyboard light is turning on for mine!","Bought this as a gift for my niece. My only complaint is the keyboard. The keys are not great, but everything else about this laptop is dope. I like it so much that I'll consider it for my next replacement laptop.","the F512DA (specifying this, because Amazon tends to randomly group this product with other laptops) is a decent laptop for $550. Nice for productivity and can run non-demanding games. The processor seems to run slightly hotter than intels i5 (8250), as I can usually hear the fan noise during workloads on which i5 remains quiet. Graphics wise vega 8 is a bit better than comparable intel UHD620. You can upgrade the RAM and the HD on this one, but since it donsn't have an extra slot for either of those, you'd have to just replace the existing one. Also, something I find weird about amazon is that this product was grouped with F510UA, when I bought it (an it is definitely not a slightly different version of that laptop) and now is grouped with some other laptop that definitely isn't the same, so pay attention to which model each review is talking about.","Excellent product. Works fine. But there is an issue. There missing some parts for connecting 2nd HDD\/SSD. Asked help from Amazon and they redirected me to Asus. But Asus didn't help.","While Asus isn't as user friendly as some other big names, they have always delivered performance for me. I just upgraded from an old vivobook, roughly 3 years old, and I've got to say it was well worth the wait. First for the bad.  I encountered some update issues and a few conflicts, but after a bit of research was able to fix all of these with no further issue. This process took me maybe a couple hours. Afterwards ,this machine has truly become a budget beast. This machine is more than capable or some mid range gaming or video editing. I'll be using this beauty to get my blog off the ground and use it as a portable desktop. I can't speak on the battery life as I do intend to keep it plugged at most times. The screen for the money is bright, vivid and engaging. Sound is clear and precise. Nothing special, but certainly not a negative. I'd highly suggest this computer over anything in its price range, as well as many above.","Terrible purchase. Not usually this critical but I\u2019m very surprised that this is even a real product and that a manufacturer can even pass this as able to sell. Took 3 times to just get past the set up, kept getting frozen and had to reset it. Screen was blurry and had a strange glare. Seemed like it was going to break at anytime. Poor product.","Screen was beautiful, but had flickering. Also, updates weren't possible for some reason.","I ordered this laptop on a Friday morning and selected the free shipping option. I was originally told it would take a week for the package to arrive but instead, it arrived on Monday afternoon. So far, I am happy with the performance of the laptop. I haven\u2019t done anything really hardcore on it, just basically web browsing, writing papers, and even some Minecraft. The computer itself is pretty well built. I mean, it\u2019s no MacBook, but then again, you\u2019re also paying $1000 less for this computer. My one minor issue is the battery life. It\u2019s not that great. I get around 4hr out of a complete charge. However, it\u2019s not that big of an issue as I use it at home most of the time and I always have access to an outlet. Overall, I\u2019m happy with the laptop and would recommend it to other people who are looking for a good budget laptop.","I like Asus, but this low-class model is not the case. It is already a year I use Asus vivobook 150 s530 Although the screen is Full HD, it is not IPS, which is very bad. The sound has a buzz above 60%. The sound of cooling fan is very loud. It is definitely impossible to open the laptop with one hand. Its edge2edge screen is very beautiful, it is lightweight. the keyboard and touchpad is quite good.","My son and I agreed to purchase a laptop for his use in his online classes.  After some significant research we decided on this laptop.  My son loves it. He says it is fast, clear screen, and he loves the backlit keyboard! He started his classes a few weeks ago, and enjoys its quick speed as he searches the internet for the information that he needs to find.  If we needed another smaller laptop we would certainly buy the newest model of this computer!","Everything is okay the only downside is its screen quality. The viewing angle is below average and the color is not that good. But if you buy this laptop for day to day tasks like web browsing, watching videos, doing homework or some office tasks then it's okay. build quality and design is awesome and stylish. Battery life is enough for me and it takes a very small amount of time for charging. After all, I'm satisfied.","256g SSD model says it comes with 8gb RAM but upon opening it there was only 4gb and no option to add a second set. Not sure why you would list 8gb but only include 4gb. Pretty shoddy. Good laptop so far otherwise, works well and screen looks nice.","The Reviews and Question Section is not very clear and even the ASUS tech support on this product is not very clear on what can or can't be added.  If you get the 256 SSD version, there are no places to connect additional storage.  Although there is room inside the case, there are no open connection to plug it into.  Other Customers that bought the 1T Hard Drive version did find that they could add extra storage.","Ever since I unboxed the laptop, the speakers sound blown out and it's absolute crap. I don't know if they're supposed to sound better, but I feel like for a BRAND NEW Laptop you should not get blown out speakers. I'm outraged.","The perfect laptop for my needs, that includes number pad included.  I returned a 14'' Asus with number pad built into trackpad because it never worked.  This one, while a bit less powerful, more than meets my needs - primarily financial software.  It's also lightweight.  Love the nano bezel for maximum viewing.  I rarely use the battery.","I\u2019m not sure what everyone is complaining about, the screen view is perfectly clear from a wide angle, the battery does good, lasting me about 4 hours with normal use, and I haven\u2019t had any slow issues. In fact, it is one of the smoothest laptops I have worked on.","Very satisfied with this laptop.  I needed a cheap quality laptop to check emails and browse the web.  Here lately I've been recruited to play Minecraft with my kids and this laptop is more than capable of handling a hour or so long session.  Sure there are faster laptops, but this works for me and the price was right.","Muy buena y excelente precio con esta laptop pagas lo que ocupas solo tiene dos puntos en contra el primero es la bater\u00eda que a mi gusto dura muy poco aunque depende bastante del uso que se le d\u00e9 el otro es el poco almacenamiento en el disco duro por lo tanto no se puede instalar muchas cosas en ese caso yo recomiendo que se le complemente con uno externo... pero para mi es un laptop muy buena","I don't like Microsoft's Edge browser, and I have used the Chrome browser (or Firefox) instead. with previous versions of Windows 10. But I cannot do this with this machine, and I have tried many times. Also, the Date and Time are incorrect, and I cannot correct that either.","There is no SATA slot in the notebook. No after-sales service from Amazon is provided, I have been told that I need to find the manufacturer directly for repair.","I like the design of the product. Has a very nice thin look. I enjoy how light the laptop actually is. It\u2019s easy to transport and fun to use. It runs games and gets the job done. Absolutely awesome! And, I love the backlit keys on the keyboard too!","I have had it less than a month and the webcam works on and off in video calls for work, and they screen randomly shows static white, pink, and black lines like it is broken. When I refresh the page it goes away but should I be worried??? I am pretty disappointed with this buy and I'm not sure what to do about it because I live in Mexico and I wont be in the states for a while if I wanted to replace it.","A lot of bang for the buck, this machine has a very fast NVMe SSD and the new Ryzen chip is very quick while being efficient too.  Good screen quality and an attractive chassis makes this laptop look and act like one in the $750-800 price bracket.","A well working for everyday use but not as good for graphic design the colors are a bit dull","Intel is not everything. AMD is also a great processor plus it is cheaper. This laptop is great for school and light gaming.","For $400 this laptop is not worth it.  I can\u2019t go 5 minutes without it crashing and I need this for school and work.  I can never get anything done with it and I\u2019ve barely had it a couple months.  If there was a way I could fix the crashing issue without spending any for money this would be a 5 star laptop for me but it isn\u2019t.  I thought if I were to wait it out it would get better but it hasn\u2019t and now I\u2019m stuck with this piece of junk and out $400.  And for a college student that is a lot of money to be throwing away.","Very nice little notebook for the price. Lightweight, small but with adequate screen size. Screen quality is crystal clear and vivid colors. Processer seems plenty fast enough for the applications I use. Very pleased with purchase so far.","OK, I knew I wasn't buying a fancy laptop when I bought this. It's OK. It's fast-ish. The main issue is the screen which is good-ish looking head-on but sucks from any angle. Even head-on it's super obvious that the screen is only lit from the center. I just wish the screen was better.","This was a cool laptop. It was good for simple school work. Nothing major. It could run light games like league of legends and overwatch on high settings. It was very loud though. Kind of started turning heads in classes because it would become loud for no reason while just chilling in class.","Whoever designed the keyboard layout does not use a computer. There is no button to turn on\/off Wi-Fi radio. There is no  indication that the numlock is on or off. The fan is underneath, so if you are using it on your bed for instance it will get hot. Besides the quirky keyboard layout, overall performance is good.","I love the feeling of their keyboard. It also doesn't burn my legs after I sit with it for a few hours. The battery is good. My only issue is that dust\/dirt got in my fan and it makes a slight whine but you can only hear it if you listen very closely. Besides that, It's one of the best laptops I found at this price point.","It's a nice laptop. Screen is good, ports on this are good. USB -C is good to use with phones that use it. Battery life is good. Haven't had a full run on it with all the updates. Hard drive is small only at 128 GB. Can be upgraded and can use NVMe. (I have tested and confirmed that it will run a NVMe) No Optical drive if looking for one. Overall it's a good day to day laptop.","Nice screen resolution, pretty quick response, lightweight which is great and the sound isn't too bad.  Would recommend this laptop.","well I liked the old one so much I  became a repeat offender, yep I just love it and if you are in a dimly lit room, the keyboard lights up","Nice perfect for travel and i love nano edge screen for movies","What I like the design light weight and the cool system. What I dislike is the volume in the speakers, its so low. I would give it a 5\/10. But besides this is a wonderful machine.","I got the ASUS VivoBook 15 Thin and Light Laptop, 15.6\u201d Full HD, AMD Quad Core R5-3500U CPU, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB PCIe SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, Windows 10 Home, F512DA-EB51, Slate Gray It's a very solid quick machine especially for the price I would highly recommend it","I got the 256gb its very light and thin, the only problem is that it's only 8gb ram with no extra ram slot. Screen quality is great, i'm not sure if it's ips panel or what but it's great enough. Fans gets loud when using heavy apps. I'm not sure yet about the battery life but so far is good. This laptop is worth the money.","Product was as described it is a nice fast machine for what my son needs.","Great screen quality! Light weight! Long battery life!","I love this thing. Works perfectly for a novelist.","Great laptop. Traveled with it and watched videos on the plane. The picture is bright and clear.","This little laptop is a great value.  Really fast SSD hard drive loads programs and pages really fast.

Awesome for coding","When it comes to computers it is fair to say that, in economic terms, I am a true consumer. having in the past 10 years purchased 9 that I can remember: 3 x tower, 6 x lap top.  (I also presently own and use an ASUS brand, model F556U.) Granted, none of these have been top of the line models, except for a jumbo-sized Dell laptop that was excellent but way too large and heavy to use comfortably anywhere but on a desk.  The rest have been a mix of Apple, and Windows-based machines that get used on a daily or regular basis, primarily for internet stuff, streaming music, and looking up formulas\/pricing on installed software.  In other words, my usage is constant but not technically demanding. On that basis, I rate this computer FIVE STARS.  Here is what I like about the machine: 1) Fast and reliable boot up from either a cold start or waking up from sleep; 2) Excellent and fast wifi AND Bluetooth connectivity; 3) Clarity and vividness of screen; 4) Suprisingly good speaker function; 5) Beautiful finger feel of keyboard both from an ergonomic and functionality standpoint; 6) Overall look and feel. The ASUS I had been using on a daily basis was cursed with an irritating and fidgety touchpad that made it a chore to use with accuracy, and was a commented upon flaw with the model.  It also took forever to boot up, especially from sleep and often lost wifi reception when it would mysteriously switch to airplane mode or turn off wifi, sometimes more than once in a session.  It is also had poor sound reproduction.  I would have rated it 3 stars. As to this computer, it looks great, it works great, it sounds good, and it feels great to operate and type on.  There is nothing I can think of to criticize it.  It just works GREAT! One thing I do miss is a CD drive, which my old ASUS has, but I realize that new laptops are all web-based and don't typically come with them.  Really, apart from that I have nothing but praise for this computer which, like its title is both Thin and Light, yet has a huge screen and is very fast and reliable.  In sum it is a pleasure to use. I can't comment upon battery life because I rarely ever have no access to an electrical outlet when using any computer.  If I do begin to use this unplugged I will update this review. I recommend this machine.","This computer was the fastest start-up I've ever had with a new computer. I think I spent no more than 2 hours getting myself oriented and  online. I like that the screen has no frame.  I like that it is so light weight.  I'm not a techie so I really want my computer to be user friendly and this ASUS is ideal for me. I'm in love.","The screen is incredible it has a 88% of ratio and it is very light. It does classical office works like excel and surfing. I remooend this item!","I wanted a nice tablet to go into retirement.  This one works well for me.","Me encanta!","The laptop is amazing for its price, but Asus really did me dirty. They have space for an additional hard drive. They decided to skip out a couple of dollars to reduce upgradability. There is another model of this laptop that is 128gb ssd, 1tb hard drive. If u want more storage, I recommend getting that model.","This computer is excellent for basic tasks. It boots up fairly quickly. It is very compact. It's overall pretty light. The fingerprint sensor is also nice to log in with. The screen is 1080P which is sufficient for most for a basic laptop. The 8GB of Ram is sufficient for basic computer. I3 processor is sufficient as well. I got 128GB of hard drive space. I can always expand with a flash drive. I personally took this out of S mode. I like the full windows experience. It has a backlight keyboard with dark rooms. The charging speed is pretty quick as well. It has multiple ports including USB C. No disc drive which is a trend in most computers of today. For the price I paid this is a great unit. It was in my price range. So it's the perfect fit. But definitely keep an eye out for the best price on this. Case in point, I'm very happy with this machine."],"11":["In 2015 I bought an 11\" Acer Chromebook to use as a tablet.  During the last year a key came off; figured to buy the same basic machine with better specs\/performance. Decided to buy this machine to get 4 GB of RAM, 32 MG of flash memory, a better display, better\/quicker network connectivity, & a quicker processor.  I've had this computer for a couple of weeks; it performs very modestly better than the model I bought in 2015.  The display is slightly better.  The computer seems \"military build quality\", but has an annoyingly designed (mini-USB?) power plug that tends to fall out of the computer (leaving the user with minimal juice for the next use); can't imagine the computer could be used with the power plug in place -- it would fall out constantly.  Network connectivity still seems seems balky. It is servicable, but don't buy this thing believing the screen \"pops\" & that this RAM, processor, memory, & wi-ri connectivity combo will really hop from site to site. I wonder why there are no reviews of this computer on Amazon.","I've had Chromebook books before. I like that it is military grade to protect from falls. And everything else is as expected with this device. My only complaint is that the screen appears matte, it looks very dark to me. Reminds me of a Kindle paperbook reader. I will decide if I keep this or not.","So far - very pleased.  Had to do a reset to improve wifi - but no further issues.  Good workhorse.  Does the job without the thrills.","Super quick shipping, does everything I need it to do. Very sturdy and lightweight. Long battery life. If you're looking for a basic laptop without all the bells, whistles and bloatware this one is perfect.","Lightweight, fast, great price","Use it to homeschool my granddaughter when she is at my house. Loads very quickly","Size is small but just right for internet use.  Price was great.  I\u2019m still learning to use it and set up with my preferences.  So far so good.","Delivered next day and product was perfect and worked flawlessly","I bought this basically for basic word processing and spreadsheets, and occasional web browsing, email, etc.  for the price, I\u2019m really happy with the purchase. It boots up and runs fast and was super fast and easy to set up using my Google account.","I'm giving this laptop 3 starts because it's only been used for about 2 weeks and we've already had to manually reboot it after it randomly turned off while still being half charged. It's working now, but I'm a little concerned on how long this laptop is actually going to last. On the positive side, it's a great looking laptop. It's light and compact, and seems to be durable.","Perfect for my daughters schooling! Great first Chromebook! Runs fast! Perfect size!","perfect for my 63 year old mom who just uses it to play games and browse Facebook.

I am using it mainly for my school work, I do full time classes at university and some are online. I needed something light and fast that I could travel with. If you are looking for something that is a powerhouse laptop at this price point you are fooling yourself. I am surprised I got this good of a deal on a laptop with a SSD in it. I bought this laptop with the mindset that I wanted something that was fast and could do a light work load because I have a powerhouse gaming Desktop PC at home, so I did not need something over the top in a laptop. I also wanted it to be light for travel. If you are looking for something that will run High FPS Games or Adobe products smoothly I 100% don't recommend this PC. This computer can handle simple games, I like to play My Time at Portia and it can run League of Legends, but most potatoes can, so it's not a gaming PC by any means, but you need to check the Games themselves and see the lowest setting you can run them on (Like you should if you are a gamer and wanting a new laptop). The size of the SSD is not the greatest, so if you do not use things like Google doc's that save to the cloud you will be wanting to get an external drive or an SD card. I believe you can install a HDD on here, but am unsure and do not plan to myself. I have a 1TB external drive for if I need to move files between computers and as a general rule of just having my files backed up to several places. Pros: - Boots up in seconds - Runs smooth for everyday light use, Internet Browsing, Watching Youtube, Hulu, Netflix - Plays some games that don't need high graphics cards or processors - SD card slot so I can extend storage if need be - Has an Ethernet Port and a HDMI port if you travel and want to put something on the bad hotel TV's Cons: - The Bloatware, so dumb and useless - No others right now Again my review is based on this product at this price point. I didn't expect this PC to run a graphics intensive Game, I would never expect a 400$ laptop to do so. I love that it came with an SSD, the storage is fine for my needs as I mainly use Google Docs for school and have an external drive. I have had no issues with the Wi-fi on the laptop as of yet, I do not expect to. If you are looking for a laptop that will offer you speed and be a great travel companion if you are in college or travel for work, you should get this one. Last thing I do recommend installing a fresh version of Windows 10 so you don't get the bloatware, or you can just uninstall the bloatware through Programs and Features. Up to you, but the bloatware you will get with almost any new Laptop.","I bought this CF0014DX computer because it seemed an acceptable package at (relatively) affordable price.  I returned it because the network adapter is terrible in my environment.  After finding better options for the buck, I realize this computer is a poor investment for most people. Spending $400 for a computer with an I3 processor is not great.  I know it is fast enough for most tasks. The network adapter here is only single band, 2.4 Ghz, 802.11bgn.  This old, over-used standard is a foolish corner-cut by HP.  Even $100 android tablets now include 5 GHZ, 802.11ac WIFI.  With the older technology you are poorly equipped to fight for bandwidth in the increasingly congested WIFI environment.  In my neighborhood I got single digit MHz downloads with the CF0014DX:  OK for most web surfing, lousy for video streaming.  With an 802.11ac adapter I get 150 MHz to 200 MHz downloads \u2013 an astonishing improvement. The good news if you already own a laptop with 2.4 Ghz WIFI is you can easily upgrade with a USB WIFI dongle costing less than $15.  There are many options, I recently had success with this one:  https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B07LFXN1SJ\/ The CF0014DX computer only has two USB ports.  Having to buy a WIFI dongle for a new computer and fill up a precious USB port is unacceptable. The other impractical aspect of this package is that the SSD is only 128 GB.  It may seem passable for you today, but 256 GB is a realistic longer term minimum for most. I bought a better version of this computer for just $70 more: model  HP 14-cf0051od with 256 GB SSD.  Some listings show it having the older WIFI standard, but it certainly has an 802.11ac network adapter.  The processor is noticeably much faster; it will seem fast for several years longer than the CF0014DX. I see the Lenovo IdeaPad 530S 14\u201d, similar in specs to my HP 14-cf0051od,  on sale at big box for lower price.  It has advantage over the two HPs of higher res graphics and ability to upgrade RAM.  But no buyer\u2019s remorse here, I have long history with HP computers and am thrilled with my cf0051od. Buying a refurbished HP Elitebook or Dell Latitude on Amazon would also be a better value than the CF0014DX.  I am a big fan of buying refurbished desktop computers (sans monitor) because they can be upgraded easily.  I\u2019m shyer about refurbished laptops because they are more delicate; you can\u2019t just swap in new keyboard, mouse or monitor; many things can be wrong with them.  Take a risk on a refurbished laptop if you are fine with evaluating and potentially returning.","I'm really only using this laptop for three things -Internet browsing -word processing via (google docs) -emails *possibly light gaming such as hearthstone or solitaire\/suduko For it's three main uses it functions very well. I mainly use this laptop for school. The 8gb of ram are plenty for my needs and the hard is ok which I'll get into. Connections -2 usb ports (one of them is a 2.0 and one of them is 3.0) however when you at the side of the laptop you cant tell which one is which cause they both look the same and the small guide that come with the laptop does not show you which is which, but that's ok for me. -1 headphone\/mic combo jack -1 HDMI port (this is particularly good if you plan to mirror you screen to a television) -1 ethernet connection (RJ-45) this is the basic ethernet connector most people use -1 power adaptor port -1 usb C port -1 card reader (which I haven't used yet) -1 connector to hook up a locking cable for you laptop (I probably will never use this but cool feature anyways) After opening the box -I like that it is a very light weight laptop which is great for traveling and school -the keyboard feels fantastic (much better than my previous lenovo) -the track pad works well and if you look at one of my photos it has some special features that allow you to zoom in on the screen and use in a way similar to a smart phone (these features also apply to the touch screen version of this laptop but the laptop I am reviewing is not a touch screen) I personally prefer a laptop with out the touch screen feature -The description says that the hard drive is a 128 GB SSD. It is indeed a SSD but they maximum capacity is 118 GB and after OS installation, windows updates, and some basic apps, the storage left over is about 80 GB. This is ok for me. When you think about it 80 GB is still a lot of storage space, and I have a 1TB external hard drive that im using to store most of my files. Also If you prefer there are many ways to get free cloud storage such as dropbox or google drive. If you plan to store large videos and\/or massive amounts of photos I would recommend getting and external hard drive. (keep in mind this laptop does have a card reader so you could also get yourself a some kind of sd card for storage space as well) Also this laptop comes in a 256 GB storage capacity, I'm guessing after the formalities it's closer to 225 GB. -The screen looks good. Its clear and bright (adjustable). great definition -The sound is ok. It really the same as you would expect for any laptop. I will be using my song headphone if I feel like getting better sound -There is a little fan that runs, but you will hardly notice it. -The laptop top does come with some bloat ware but you can sort that for your self or just keep. ( you might not even notice the difference) -The cold start time is about 8 seconds (that's really fast!) Things to Note -Don't buy the expert setup. Save yourself the 80 dollars and buy some accessories. The setup is simple and the laptop will walk you through the process (nothing major to do). All I did was plug in the laptop to an outlet, turned it on, and cortana walks you through the process. It only take about five minutes. Add another five minutes to run windows update and download\/install the newest updates. It really is easy. -This laptop does not have a CD drive. It says so in the description on amazon. I'm just pointing it out for those who skipped straight to the review section. -If gaming is your biggest concern I would not suggest this laptop. It does have a decent processor and amount of ram, but it's more for general use and apps that consume less of your cpu power. -Amazon offers a warranty. You can get it if you want; that part is really up to you, and depends on how much abuse you think you might put your laptop through. If you're on the fence about the warranty, HP themselves offer a warranty that you can purchase after the fact when you setup the laptop for the first time. I believe it cost 80 dollars for three years. In conclusion If you feel like you identify with the student\/worker\/average person who needs a laptop for travel and general use, you can purchase this laptop knowing it will perform well for you. HP is a great brand and makes reliable computers. I would highly recommend this laptop for anyone who plans to use it for school.","I bought this laptop knowing it wouldn't be a powerhouse. This is a basic laptop that functions well for a great budget price. I bought this for the online classes I am taking and some light internet browsing, aka Pinterest, Facebook, etc. I wouldn't recommend it for gaming or for if you need any software like AutoCad, photo editing software or for work purposes. This is a great personal use computer and for school depending on your degree.  I immediately uninstalled the game pack that came with it. I wish you could uninstall the other bloatware that comes with it, unfortunately I am having a hard time finding it to uninstall. There are so many \"trials\" for games, dropbox, etc. that I don't want popping up all the time hence the 4 stars.","I bought this in a rush when my Dell died suddenly.  I basically looked at price and the reviews.  I was interested in a home laptop to use for emails, surfing, and Office applications.  I'm very impressed with what I've seen so far.  Good battery life, nice size (14\" seemed a lot smaller than my 17\" Dell, but as noted in other reviews, the design of the keyboard gives me the same keyboard area as my Dell) and it's very lightweight.  No complaints at all.  For the money I think this is a very nice laptop.","I've only had this for a day, but it looks great in terms of speed and ease. Looks like a good laptop for the price. I will be using it basically for writing and browsing the internet. There was a lot of MS bloatware though, that I got rid of. Only thing, description says Ash Silver, I got Gold. Other than that- looks good. Seller: TechFamily.","I bought this with on a tight budget. Even though I was kinda doubtful about it having an i3 processor, I am very satisfied with it. I'm currently using it in a nursing program, where I take exams online. It hasn't lagged or frozen during my exams, yet. Hopefully it'll stay like this for the next 2 years. I don't do anything else on it except for school related stuff, and it is runs good enough for my needs.","Some reviews compared to a Macbook, which is unfair. This computer costs 1\/3 price and you should expect some trade offs for saving that $1000. I am using it only for internet access and simple word processing, spreadsheet tasks. Does those jobs admirably. It is a bit slow to start up and needs a nudge to connect \"automatically\" to my trusted wifi networks. But nothing a couple of seconds patience won't overcome.","I'm a college student so I needed a laptop that was lightweight, portable, good battery life, and can run multiple programs at once (i.e. Excel, Word, Chrome). I've had this laptop for almost four months now and it has met all of my needs and then some! Battery lasts all day, laptop is extremely light, and I can easily run many programs at once. I got this to replace an older Mac Book Pro, and this is an upgrade in my opinion.","Just received today and so far I love it!  Super fast. Love that the keyboard doesn\u2019t have the number keypad. Keys are large and easy to type on.  Screen is super clear","I'm a college student without a whole lot of money, so I saved up for a while to afford this. It worked AMAZINGLY for a month, never ran slow, and had minimal problems. I had set it down at one point on a table, and the screen jostled due to how I put it down, causing it to take on the appearance of a glitchy checkerboard-- But it was fixed by turning it off and then back on. But I booted up my laptop today, and suddenly, there's a black blob on the screen. From VERY casual use, the screen has burned out, it appears. When not in use, I keep my laptop ontop of a plastic tote under my bed. It's never on the floor, it's never been dropped, it just lived under my bed until I needed it. Yes, the computer still works, but I can't believe that I have to deal with a giant blob on the bottom of my screen now! I would've bought the warranty, but I couldn't afford it.","I am not going to lie, with decent SSD memory, 8 gigs of Ram and the i3 processors (not the high dollar i5 or i7), I am pretty happy with my less than $400 purchase.  If you are looking for a \"Chromebook\", this machine is a little deceiving at first.  It comes with Microsoft Windows 10 operating system in \"S\" mode.  If you want to keep it in \"S mode\" that's fine; however, I think that \"S mode\" simply makes it impossible to utilize Google and other apps on a device that has the capability to do more.  I turned it off on day two and I have been happy with my machine.  If you aren't willing to fart with Microsoft monopoly \"s mode\" crap, I would recommend buying a Chrome book for about $100 more.  I think this is a good machine with a lot of potential, but I also think \"S mode\" is stupid.  It isn't safety and security that they are marketing with \"S-mode\", it's creating division and preventing free market apps unless you turn it off or elect to change operating systems. I have owned this machine for less than two weeks and I like it.  I had to change mouse setting and play with that \"S Mode\"  stuff, but overall I am satisfied with my replacement computer after using the same machine for 10 years (MacBook Pro).  With a large family and a tight budget, I am happy with my purchase so far.","Ordered August 16, 2019 for school. The computer was meeting my needs and working great until September 26, 2019. It would not turn on, then I plugged in and the charge light was on, but only momentarily, the light no longer indicates a charge, the battery is hot despite being charged. I tried several outlets, unplugging to let the battery cool, but nothing seems to be working. Just over 30 days and it's dead :( I have contacted seller through Amazon to see how we can fix the problem. I will say that before it stopped working, the screen was great, battery life was good lasting a day of use at school, keys were easy to use, and the speed of the operating system was sufficient for my needs as a law student. I hope there's a remedy for my laptop, I need it back asap.","I didn't get to use it. I received it damaged. What ever it hit went through 2 boxes and an air gap of about an inch.  Still put a dent in the bottom of the computer 1\/8\" deep. Not happy about that. Plus nothing was done for me but putting the amount on a gift card. Because they were out of the computer I ordered. Locking me into buying from Amazon.  Even though I needed the computer asap. Not to happy about the whole ordeal.","A Very mediocre machine, you are paying 400 dollars for it. I bought it for my niece for school. No gaming, no advanced editing or engineering work. Streaming online, writting essays\/ powerpoint, and watching movies is what this laptop will be good for. I understood this going in, so please don't expect a supercomputer. The people bashing this computer as slow? It's 400 dollars, what are you expecting? This is the Corolla of laptops, if you want a Porsche shell out 800 minimum.","I bought this computer after returning a cheaper HP laptop.  But this low end laptop is still to low for me to recommend it.  It appears to start up quickly, but it takes forever to be ready to display anything complicated (like a photo accompanying an email).  It basically is very dim-witted.  It responds slowly.  It drops entire web pages.  It does not reach the level of a sturdy simple computer, which is what I need.  The battery life is much better than my old Dell laptop, and it is light weight.  Those are the only reasons I ever carry this laptop.  For anything serious, I use my ancient Dell.","Ive had it for about a month. I was tryibg to find a decent laptop for around 400$ that i would be able to work off and stay mobile with. It does everything I need to run my buisness and has pretty good battary life. One thing I really like is how fast it boots up it comes on in seconds and loads programs fast. Browsing speed is really good too and im able to multitask without slowdowns. The screen is good but is subject to glare pretty easily at times. Touchpad is solid as well as the keyboard. Its not incredible in any department but if youre looking for something that can keep up with a fast paced lifestyle it works great. A solid laptop at a great price point. 7\/10 in my book.","I wanted to like this laptop, and initially I was excited to use it. Immediately upon opening the shipping box I noticed that it was labeled on the physical laptop that it ran windows 10 in S mode. What this means is that any function, download, or App that is not curated from the Microsoft Store will not run in the computer. One can turn off S mode pretty easily but it negatively impacts the speed and performance of the laptop. The specs that the laptop advertises are generated when using S mode, so when turning off S mode, the qualifications the laptop sold you on, can be incorrect. I do not want this feature, and my problem is that this feature was not displayed accurately or, well, even at all on this store page. Had it been mentioned and accurately advertised that this computer ran in S mode, I would not have purchased it. That by itself wouldn't have warranted a review, but this laptop at the time of me writing this, is less than 24 hours old and I'm being notified during the boot sequence that a broken fan (90B) is being detected and continued use of the laptop will result in possible system failure (it will break the system). The fact that this laptop shipped broken, with an obvious fan issue, pushes me to attempt to get a refund. I didn't want to spend time on this, I have enough already in my day but I can't waste money on faulty products and can't spend more to fix something that should have been 100% functional when it was shipped to me. This is probably an unusual event for these laptops, and honestly if it wasn't for the broken fan I would have been content, but again, can't throw money at things that should have worked on reception.","Start up is wonderfully fast even with the large amount of easy-to-remove bloatware that came pre-installed. I\u2019ve written several papers on this laptop now and haven\u2019t had any problems. The machine performs exactly as I expected. If I had to pick one negative, it would be wishing that the keyboard were backlit and had a numeric keypad. But alas, I went for a more affordable model and am happier for the money I saved making that choice.","Buen desempe\u00f1o por el precio. El ventilador hace un poco de ruido. El espacio del disco duro un poco limitado. Y no es adecuada para procesos de edici\u00f3n complejos. En general muy bien","Bought this arrived on time screen was pitch black brightness was 100% talked to Amazon agent sent me to hp not dealing with this crap got my money back don't buy hp laptops","Lleg\u00f3 antes de tiempo . A\u00fan no la he usado. No trae el programa de office 365 solo trial y comprar luego.","First one had severe screen distortion. Replacement has just a black screen. Would not but this product again. Spent $50 to FedEx the 2nd laptop to the person that needed it immediately and 2nd one didn't work either. Going to buy a Mac book","I\u2019ve been an Apple user up until now. I use an HP at work and needed to replace my old MacBook. Instead of a $2000 computer, I decided to try something cheaper.. I was really nervous but it has paid off. I was pleasantly surprised by this hp laptop. It runs smoothly, it\u2019s light, the battery lasts forever! I was easily able to download my adobe and drawing programs to it. So far no issues! It\u2019s perfect for writing, engineer work and drawing \/ design programs. I\u2019d recommend a case for the laptop, but other than that it\u2019s 5\/5!","I bought this product for my wife and she is happy with the laptop.","I love the look, size and feel of my new HP. It is super fast with the solid state hard drive. It shipped fast and arrived un damaged. Would recommend for the price point and quality computer that you can throw in a bag and go.","Laptop does what is expected. Make sure to at least upgrade to the 8MB RAM, otherwise expect a slower processing. Otherwise this is a solid low prices machine. I use it for web surfing, word, excel, and powerpoint. Not sure I would expect more from it.","I use this laptop as a platform that runs to a hub.  The hub operates two monitors, two printers, a backup external drive and a host of other items.  It's fast and efficient.  Plus if I want to unplug to take it with me, it is so portable.  Cool.","I went to a local retail store to see what size screen would fit my needs best. The 13\u201d too small, 15.6\u201d too big.  14\u201d just right. Very light, great for travel. I\u2019m a teacher and use it to do basic school work and internet functions. Set up was easy enough and thus far I\u2019m very happy with the performance. Start up time is fairly quick, no complaints. Get a SSD drive instead of a spinning hard drive because you\u2019ll get longer battery life. I\u2019m a mouse person, so I got a wireless one and it works great.","I have used this laptop as my main computer for several months. It was convenient to carry to the medical facilities, where I spent most of my time with my aged Mom for 3 months. I use it mostly plugged in, so really haven't tested the battery life. It came with a small crack in the left side frame, which has gradually become more prominent. I need to glue that down. Not sure it has anything to do with this laptop, but typing, etc. is a real learning curb for me, especially on Facebook posts. The cursor seems to fly away sometimes. Not sure if it's all laptops, but Microsoft frequently prevents Firefox from accessing their graphics hardware and the FB feed stalls and the next 3 post photos or images disappear from the screen. But, I am a HP fan and wouldn't trade this laptop for any other. It's also just the right size for my needs. I'm giving it 5 stars because I'm sure these grievances have more to do with Microsoft and my own learning curb.","Bought this laptop for a friend who goes to college. Upon using it for a couple weeks they said they liked it and it was super fast. They had no issues or hiccups since then. Laptop is great for simple work like homework browsing the web checking emails. I wouldn't recommend this laptop for any type of heavy gaming. All in all this laptop is great for everyday light use.","Light and fast even with the 3 level processor. It has a solid state drive that speeds it up, lengthens battery life and lightens it up. The touch pad is too large however and I am inadvertently selecting items I don\u2019t want. Be careful to keep your palms off the touch pad when typing","first off.... the screen res is absolutely horrible.... second.....IT'S SO SLOW......I just wanted a computer to do basic things for work....multiple windows opened....Skype calls.....etc.....this computer can't do any of that....well, not the one I got atleast. It has froze up on me multiple times when I try to make a Skype call......& I know for a fact it's not my wifi. I never have issues when using my tablets...phones.....friends laptops...etc....just this one.... do not buy this laptop. I know the price may seem good to you....but just spend a bit more for better quality...","Overall I am satisfied with my purchase. The audio is great in my opinion, and the laptop is sleek and a good weight and size. The screen is clear and bright as well. The battery life is also great; I have been using it on and off for a few days on a single charge. Since I needed a laptop for college, battery life was my priority. The only downside is that it does seem a tad bit slow consistently, especially if there are more than a few tabs open.","Just what we needed it. We shopped around and decided on this one, and so happy we did. We travel a lot, that's we need a lightweight laptop. And this one has it all. Buy it!","I had to purchase this laptop more out of haste because my previous laptop had complications, but I can say I'm actually quite happy with this one. It worked as expected for me and has a quick running speed for the applications I need as a university student. The smaller size makes it much lighter and easier to carry around in a smaller backpack, which is helpful when you have to walk around and switch to different parts of campus nearly every day. So far there hasn't been any major issues that would have made me give a lower rating, so sverall I'd say that the purchase was 100% worth it and I got the product as expected.","Bought this for work; I need it for MS-Word, excel, and gmail. The keyboard is fantastic; great key action, not mushy like so many other laptop keyboards. Boots up super fast b\/c of the SSD. Runs cool. It's very lightweight and thin. Battery life is average. I'm extremely pleased with this purchase.","I would recommend this laptop for any buyers just looking for a very basic laptop.  It is very quick to boot up so no wait time to get started on things like paying bills, surfing the net or checking emails.  This would be a great laptop for an older adult or student who just needs one for the essential things because it is a very easy-to-use system.  Also love the fact that is has so many port types (hdmi, SD Card Slot, 2 USB, and even an ethernet port for those every now and then moments) - no special adapters needed :)!!!","On-line description did not mention that the computer could only be used with Microsoft approved sites and aps. It did not have a DVD drive and could not be connected to network printer. This  computer may be just perfect for a student or younger user, it did not fill my needs. I could not give it a higher rating because of the limitations.","This computer is a lightweight computer. It runs very well. The keyboard is easy to type on. It does not have a VGA port and only has one HDMI port. Very happy with it. Came pre-installed with a bunch of software that took time to delete.","I bought this laptop for my wife for basic needs.  She loves the size and weight of the laptop.  It performs well so far, no issues.","My old Hp laptop went out and I'm a college student so I needed something right away .  This laptop came and it is so lightweight and sleek and feels so good. I love it, the design is good, the keyboard has a wonderful feel to it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs a laptop in a pinch. This is such an upgrade from my previous laptop and I love it !!","Bought this for my husband.  He really likes it.  Much faster than his old computer and it doesn't freeze like the old one did.  He is very pleased with it.","Bought this laptop for work and so far I am very happy with it. Blown away with everything it does, especially for the price, even though the screen is a little too small but I am going to use a monitor to help with it. No complaints whatsoever so far. Will update review later on.","Laptop is great for the purpose for which I purchased it. Starts up quickly. Battery life seems adequate so far. Don't set your expectations high on screen quality with this machine. Resolution makes a difference, so just keep this in mind when evaluating your options.  Overall, nice machine for the price.","Great first laptop for my seven year old neice. Quick enough and very good looking. Battery life seems good for her for one day.","I knew a 14\" laptop was going to be small, but dang. Wasn't prepared for how small the screen and the keyboard would be.","Quick ship. Nice notebook. Hate Win10 and Apps, but use Win7 desktop and menu converter. Screen didn\u2019t seem sharp, but appears to have self adjusted. Besides Win10, very happy. Follow-up after month of use.  No issues perfect for my travel and desktop need.  Processor fine, but needs more Ram.  Recommend buying.","Idk anything about laptops. This one stays at home, mostly plugged in, and I just surf the web with a million tabs open. Doesnt lack speed or anything, good for typical college papers n stuff","Right of the box I had a windows error and couldn\u2019t even get onto it the first prompt. I had to spend over an hour on the phone with tech support to totally factor reset the computer. A software issue.  It is currently resetting itself. I willbe returning if this didn\u2019t fix it. I shouldn\u2019t of even had to work on it fresh out of the box. Zero stars if I could.","EDIT looks like you can switch out of S mode. Will update after using laptop.

Daughter loved the speed and how light it was.","Don't care for s mode can't do anything other than what Microsoft wants you to. Turned it off. Good speed. Just getting to know it at this time.","I haven't had it long enough to really rate it. My last one only lasted one year. I will give a better review after one year with this one.

However I am happy with the laptop","todo perfecto, llego lo que encargue a tiempo .","Very good laptop for the money. For just surfing and basic activities this is a reasonable one.","It's a decent budget laptop but I've only used it for a few days. My big disappointment is that the hard drive cable (part # L23187-001) is not currently available so I don't see a way to upgrade the M.2 to a higher-capacity \"regular\" and more affordable SSD.","Best feature is that with a 14\" display it's not as big and bulky as the more common 16\" laptops, but still a good size keyboard and overall features. Shines compared to the new large cell phones on the low end and the big and bulkier laptops above it. Very convenient and highly recommended.","I used the computer once following set up. It seems to work well. I was looking for a specific system, combining a i3 processor, SSD drive (128 Go in this case) and 8Go of RAM. Set up was easy, all done using voice activated system.

New, this is around $300, mine is \"Refurbished\" for $188.  And if it holds up which I think it will, I am walking away from Microsoft with their never ending PROBLEMS and BUGGY PRODUCTS.  One thing, Chromebooks don't have DVD\/CD Drives or Hard Drives (a Negative and a Positive) but they offer abundant Cloud Storage (a Positive and a Negative).  No Drives means very few moving parts to break and very little heat to dissipate...I don't think they even have fans!  Well, I am willing to spend $188 to test out this alternative path from MS which I have been searching for for years, Chromebooks have no Operating System other than the Chrome Browser.  Google provides lifetime Free Virus Protection, An Entire Suite of Office Apps called Google Docs (no Outlook or MS Works needed...YAY!) plus Hundreds more Apps at No Charge!  Try it, You'll Like it.","This was a replacement for another Chromebook so the performance was as expected eg. excellent. What pleasantly surprised me , because I hadn't given it any thought , was that all my sites were there complete with remembered passwords. Chromebooks are the best buy for the buck.","I bought these, specifically, for my 4 kids whom I homeschool. I didn't want anything outlandishly expensive; just very basic. Something they can do their schoolwork on, typing courses, etc. This computer totally fits the bill. The screen is big, the keyboard is great, and even though it doesn't have too many bells and whistles, this is perfect for our needs. And the price?! YOU BETCHA. Totally satisfied with our purchase.","I\u2019m highly impressed with this laptop! The price is unbeatable and the computer itself works flawlessly considering it is Certified Refurbished","I have to start off by saying that I'm a Chromebook fan. I've tested several and owned a few. There are still apps (when I was growing up, we called them \"programs\" and \"software\") that will only run on a PC, but I try when possible to take a Chromebook with me wherever I go because they are just so damn handy. Why is this important? Because this review is not here to hate on Chromebooks. They are great little machines. Many reviews hate the OS, and don't focus on the hardware when writing their reviews. Unfortunately, this 2017 Acer Flagship CB3-532 15.6\" HD \"Premium Chromebook\" is not really \"premium.\" For two Benjamins, it's still a better computer than NASA had for all the Apollo missions-- in the space crafts and on the ground combined. But I was expecting more. I have a 2015 Asus 10\" Chromebook which outperforms this 2017 15\" Chromebook, and they were both the same price. I was hoping to \"trade-up\" but it looks like I'll keep the mini Chromebook and just use this 15\" Chromebook as a spare at the office. My Chromebook arrived refurbished, and I knew that going in when I purchased it. But sadly, mine arrived with schmutz all over the case (mainly on the bottom, and along the sides). The screen and keyboard were (thankfully) clean. But the rest of the case was honestly gross. We're talking about dirt, skin oils, and maybe food stains. I don't know what. Someone should have wiped this down with a rag before shipping it. It was absolutely disgusting to receive it with visible stains and foreign material on it. The screen quality is decent-enough. Technically, it may be \"HD,\" but it doesn't pop with color and brightness like many other HD screens. Reading emails, the text is kind of soft and fuzzy compared to my Asus PC latpop screen and Asus 10\" Chromebook. I'd give the Acer 15\" screen a 7\/10 in the visual department. Again, not bad for the price, but certainly not up-to-par with other laptop screens we're now seeing. The speakers are awesome. Not only are they of good quality, but they face up! Frankly, it should be international law that all laptops have upward facing speakers so that we can actually hear them. The keyboard is excellent. Feels pro-quality, and it's not too loud (some cheap laptops have a clickity-clack problem). Could use this on a plane in first class and not disturb the blue-blood next to you with his poodle and monocle. Where this Chromebook really fails is in power. Now, I'm not expecting Cray Supercomputer here (have I dated myself yet?), but I was disappointed when I tried to run 4k video from YouTube. It was a complete no-go. Not entirely unexpected, but I was hoping a \"premium\" Chromebook could handle it. What's more disappointing is that it hiccuped a bit even on 1080 HD video from YouTube. That's no bueno. I tried watching a couple videos on this Chromebook and compared it to my PC, and the Chromebook just didn't have the mojo or gusto or eye of the tiger. In summary, this Chromebook is a good value overall, but it's far from premium. For the price, it's a worthy contended, But if you like to watch HD Netflix or other streaming film, I think I'd look for another laptop of Chromebook with better video capabilities. UPDATE: The day this refurbished model was delivered, I noticed that Walmart had brand new ones for less money. I'll be returning this used model.","I purchased this for my wife to use in the Master's program she has started. She was frustrated by our old computer, and this works like a breeze. The Chromebook OS lets her have immediate start-up, while our Office 365 account allows her to use a full host of Microsoft products online, if she needs something outside the Google products. She had been extremely pleased and wished she would have purchased a Chromebook years ago.","i have had about 4 laptops int he past 10 years -after my last one i decided to get a chromebook simply because i do not like windows i got this today and really expected to spend the night trying to figure this out-much to my surprise it took me less than 2 minutes to get it set up and running it doesnt take long to power up and get online like my hp and i love it only problem i wouldsay is it has no dvd drive but i am ok with that i wanted a basic computer that is simple to use and i got one -couldnt be happier","I will tell you this is a great buy.I can not believe the price and the product is great.I am so happy with my decision on this purchase.It moves very fast and adding external usb drive works fine . Thanks for a good deal.","At first, I loved this laptop. It was easy to set up. Loved the big screen and ease of use. Unfortunately a few days ago I started to notice it glitching. It would black out and turn off in the middle of using it. It blacked out yesterday and now it won't come back on. It's only 6 weeks old so this  is a huge disappointment. The even bigger disappointment is we are past the 30 day return policy. Now we are stuck with a laptop that doesn't work. There are risks to buying refurbished items.","After not even 6 months of light to medium use my computer no longer works. The screen is all messed up. I would not reccomend.","Refurbished, really. Can't tell, looks great, sounds great and works perfect.  I have to admit this is my first Chrome book, alittle different.  Not like my android phone and not like my Microsoft Surface, so there will be a learning curve.  So far so good. Update:  damm, the price went $50.00.  Goto walmart you can get a brand new one for $179.00","The charging port is broken.  Just like that, the chromebook doesn't charge at all.  This happened the third week of use, I'm happy I can still return.  Be wary of refurbished, it's basically saying that it is either broken or will break shortly.","Screen is okay for price point latpop is big for the price keys feel good touch pad tracks good and clicks aubile but not to loud it has 2 big speakers grate sound beyond suprised wirh sound  quality and love the sumilted metal finish. I  Recommend A Egiant 15.6 laptop sleeve with pocket fits your laptop is tuff and holds charger and laptop and some writting pens and penclias and maybe a small not pad","I wanted to get a laptop for my stepdad because his was infected with so many different things that it didn't work properly anymore. So, when I saw this I couldn't believe my luck at the amazing price! I got it in the mail yesterday and set it up for him so it would be ready when he got home from work. It runs so smooth;y that I couldn't believe it! It answers commands immediately, the display color is fantastic, it has great speakers, he can use a regular mouse on it, and SO many other things! I'm EXTREMELY happy with this purchase, and my stepdad was even happier. THANKS GUYS!","Great deal - Great Chromebook!  Arrived today and booted up instantly with great performance. I was up and running in minutes.  For the price its perfect for my school classes and budget.  The display is HUGE and clear for my needs.  Its a NON-GLOSS display and perfect for all the basics.  Good keyboard and soft touch keys. It also has plenty of room to rest your palm so thats nice but I always use an external mouse.  I never had a Chromebook and was surprised there is NO Delete Key. I looked over and over and NO delete key.  I find that when you Right Click you can delete stuff.  I thought it was listed as Black its really a Dark Charcoal Grey which I love even more!  Professional packing and all.","Ok.  I've had this for several months now, and it is a great value.  First off, there are some suspect reviews that say it does not stream video.  That is absurd.  Streaming is what it is designed to do, and it does it very well.  Considering what you are paying, the top mounted speakers are great.  Then the reviewer told of dried-on food and other nonsense (while giving it a 5 star review).  Come on, man. Looking at the reviews, there are a lot of people who order a Chromebook who have no idea what it is.  They get it, start looking for Windows or whatever, and when they do not find it (duh) they write a nasty review and return it.  So . . . there are a lot of brand spanking new returned \"reconditioned\" Chromebooks.  For $144, I got one.  No signs of wear whatever.  The foot pads were pristine.  I have a MacBook and a big iMac, and they have their uses, but this Chromebook is my everyday knockabout go-to machine for internet access, movies, whatever.  A great value.  Enjoy.","Our second Acer, loved the first for almost 3 years. This was its replacement, but has a high pitched whine when operating. Can\u2019t deal with the noise!  This seller should be avoided at all cost. Poor response, returned the defective device, in their possession for three days and no word from seller!  I will never do business with them again!","The Chromebook was much  heavier than the specs listed in Amazon.com said it would be (2.6 lbs), more than twice as heavy (around 6 lbs)! It worked fine for the first two weeks. Then it went dark and would not turn back on even though it was fully charged. I returned it to the Acer store that I purchased it from using the Amazon instructions and return labels. I was surprised that I had to pay return postage to UPS ($21).  UPS reported delivering it on 10-29-18 and as of today 11-8-18 I have not heard back from Amazon or the Acer Store about my refund. I've written to them twice and have heard nothing! This is terrible customer service from both the Acer Store and Amazon.com! Beware!","This is a good computer for what it is, and what it is is a Chromebook. That means it is a laptop running Google\u2019s Chrome OS. The operating system is fast and very user friendly. One thing that people will complain about is the amount of space that the laptop comes with. It\u2019s about 15gb. Before you freak out about that, let me explain WHY the storage is so small. Chromebooks use what are called web apps. That means you don\u2019t need to (or more accurately, can\u2019t) download programs. That being said, don\u2019t expect to be downloading games and movies. The battery life is about 12 hours (unless you use the computer the way I do. I\u2019ll explain later) The camera looks good, albeit slightly grainy. Well, when it\u2019s not skipping frames. With the main focus being on web apps, that would mean that you have to be online constantly to make the most use of the laptop. There are of course, a few offline comparable apps that you can find in the Chrome Web Store if you ever find yourself without connection. If you want to unlock the full potential (and very quickly run up your memory) you can take advantage of the fact that ChromeOS is Linux based and install Ubuntu. I won\u2019t get into that, just simply explain that it\u2019s possible. For your money, it is a good machine and I actually enjoy using it.","I purchased this for a friend and now I'm jealous.  I love the Chrome platform and I would get one myself if I could get one equipped with a much larger hard drive.  I currently use the Chrome browser in my Windows 10 laptop.  It's super quick and a lot more reliable. Update: 2 weeks later.  Still running like a champ.  My friend went to this from a 7\" tablet because, well, we're all getting older and the eyes don't see as good as before.  Bigger screen, easy to see.  This is more or less a large tablet with a keyboard.  I like the fact that we didn't need to get any security software to protect it, Google seems to have that under control","As a student, im not exactly rolling in money but needed a laptop for school so a Chromebook was a given. This product shipped on time, had no visible scratches and the cheapest i have found and has had no problems in these first few weeks. The only thing thats not quite as good as i wanted (given the price isn't a big deal at all) is just the track pad is a bit finicky. all being said is a solid product and i wasn't even able to tell it was refurbished.","The laptop came in good condition (as expected because it was refurbished). But the charger was defective. I plugged it in and the charging light wouldn\u2019t show. I called Acer support line and they said either the laptop or the charger might be defective. However, I went to Best Buy and purchased a new charger because I needed to use the laptop immediately. Now, the laptop is working perfectly and the new charger is great. The photo below shows the defective charger (in white) and the functional charger I purchased (in black).","First time using chrome wanted windows 10 but haven't had to use my phone anymore and I no longer charge then since this helps me do everything I need at light speed! Been playing games on it non stop while streaming videos and it just blends if u multi tasking and are addicted to YouTube like myself....it's a powerful laptop for a Chromebook I've run multiple pages in HD videos streaming with very minimal lag (due to area of internet). But what I love the most is the charger which is very important as to how long ur laptop will last, not only is it super fast at charging but it is delicate and easy to plug in and it pops off as a safety mechanism I believe...either way it never overheats it charges really fast even during heavy use and it has options to really dim down the screen to save energy. It's like a tablet but you can do way more and run apps with easy... A must have if you like to entertain your family or others as the speakers on this babe are crisp and clear. It's also light and it comes with this cool bubble wrapping packaging that I've been using in between my lap and the laptop and for storage . My fav thing about this is it's taken over my use or cravings to even use a mobile or smartphone\/iPhone which is only explained by how easy it is to get everything social media done on a Chromebook while I do plan to get a Dell that runs windows 10 this is really good to save ur other devices from the load social media and YouTube can out on a device built to run more complex programs.  So get one for sure and forget about charging ur phone and looking like a boy who can out down his Gameboy lol jk","this equipment I bought from you cant be used.  I cant even install office on it. this Laptop has field me.  If you have a better one in stock I can choose from and seed this one back will be of help.  please hep I am losing my customers.","2 weeks ago I started having problem using my earphones ...they would  intermittently stop working.... now they will not work at all...Saturday it stopped charging....... all started 95 days after I received... not happy....also sticky keys. They responded to my e-mail  over 30 days after I sent notice to them...do not recommend. UPDATE  Nov 14 2018....stopped working altogether this AM..... Very disappointed in this piece of junk","I was in the market for a Chromebook to do my school work on as an educator and not break my pocketbook purchasing it. This one fit the bill. So far so good. I have been using it daily, numerous times a day for over a month now. It is a great laptop for my educational classroom needs.","If I could give this laptop a 0 star I would unfortunately I\u2019m stuck having to give it a 1 star. Please people don\u2019t be fooled by the price because I had this laptop just for half an hour and it began to start static and we weren\u2019t able to download windows and sketchup. I definitely would not recommend this to anyone trust me. So you\u2019ve been warned, to each is own!!!!!!","Laptop is fair. It's slightly slow but is good enough speed if you use it to just surf the internet like I do. However, on day 92 after I bought it the laptop stopped charging. Local repair shop said it was a hardware malfunction and would cost $154.99 to fix, which is the cost of a new computer. Thought since it was only 2 days outside the warranty the seller gives (90 days), they might work with me. I could understand if they didn't but then they went out of their way to say I bought it 129 days ago and is far outside the warranty. That just isn't true and I don't feel this seller is honest or the laptop is built for long term use.","The Chromebook is basically a glorified tablet in the shape of a lappy.  I don't mean that in a bad way; that's just what the product is.  I wanted something for lite to medium duty, basic everyday online activity and my work as an online tutor.  I write a lot, so a lot of online research, and watch a lot of videos I've downloaded else where.  I figured this would be good for all that, and I think I was right.  You basically have functionality like a tablet:  Everything is done by, on or through the web, including storage.  You can't install programs, this thing has no hard drive.  You CAN download apps from the Google Play Store, and you will find most of what you want for free.  I was worried that I wouldn't be able to watch videos that I downloaded elsewhere on a USB drive, but it works fine.  Haven't tried music like that yet, or ebooks....the latter of which I doubt if there is any way to open unless they were purchased on this machine. This Chromebook is light, but I wouldn't say it feels durable; I wouldn't recommend you give it the slam test to see how it holds up.  Doesn't seem fragile...but it's plasticy, and that's to be expected. The one thing I DON'T like about it is the power adapter plug.  As we all know, this is the most blatant, in-your-face, ongoing scam on laptop users and has been since the beginning:  The whole machine depends on an unsupported, usually not well insulated, it's gonna break from stress not how but when plug in the side of the computer.  The plug always sticks out just BEGGING to take a hit from something, or be the point of impact in a drop.  Just plugging this one in feels like an act of senseless optimism; it is seriously a dainty little mini-plug in a plastic housed plug in the traditional back left side of the machine.  Sooner or later, the ground will come loose inside, and that's that.  It is total BS the manufacturers don't design this better.  But, that's what they want:  When it fails, and it will, the consumer gets the blame for it, and then you gotta buy a new machine.  Can they do better?  Ever see a Mac?  The magnetic connector they use solves all those problems; anything pulls on it, it just magnetically disconnects.  Anything pulls on one of these, and you suck up your seat pants until you see if the plug or the connection has been ruined.  It's just a matter of time before I'm propping the plug up with something to make it work, then one day....bzzt.  Gotta get a new machine because replacing the charger input port is more time and trouble and money than it's worth. But, that said, virtually all laptops have that issue.  The manufacturers see it as a built in way to keep selling new machines, and the consumer can't do anything about it.  So is it fair to criticize this machine for a systemic flaw in ALL laptops (except Macs)?  Eh, you decide. Overall, I'm perfectly happy with this thing.  I did some research and knew exactly what I was getting, and it's what I expected.  So I'm perfectly down with that.  But if you're expecting the full functionality of a full laptop computer (which most people waste 90 percent of the potential of, anyway), you may be frustrated or underwhelmed.  If you're expecting a cheap, functioning Chromebook with no obvious design flaws or inherent shortcomings, you'll probably be like me:  I'm not thrilled to the point of squealing and clapping my hands like a six year old girl that just got a newest Barbie for Christmas, but I didn't expect I would be.  This thing is cheap, a good value, gets exactly the job done that I bought it for, and should last long enough to be a solid value.  Nothing magical here, just a good value, if tablet functionality with a focus on online features if what you need. Except that GD power plug.  But we're all stuck in that slowly sinking ship.  (God, I miss my Mac...)","9\/29\/17 Update:  After using this for awhile I wish the keyboard had a \"Delete\" key. No issues though. This was my first chromebook and I am pleased.  Exactly what I need for a great price.  Setup was easy.","I've been curious about chromebooks since I've sent two kids off to college. I bought this one because the price was ideal for me to try it out! Overall, I've been extremely pleased. It's only got 2 gigabytes of RAM, so I wondered if it would be a bit sluggish. So far, I haven't seen that at all! It actually seems to be snappier than Chrome on my Windows PC! Now, I don't keep a lot of tabs open at once, so I may not have really tested that. I like the placement of the speakers right on top. They are loud enough and clear enough for me and they really do a good job. The sound quality out of them is very tinny though. That's not too surprising and it's really what I expect out of a device this price. The screen is a good size! I don't have the best eyesight so it's really helpful to have a larger screen. I think I'd have trouble with an 11 or 13 inch screen but this one seems fine. It is however, pretty washed out. Just not enough contrast in the screen, and no way to alter such settings through the operating system Overall, it's a great machine for my needs and I highly recommend it if you need a low cost, simple machine for light tasks","It was a gift for senior citizens. They had it working in minutes from unboxing. Looks like good value 5 stars. Delivery was as advertised even when hurricanes raging last week. Much easier to start up than typical pc.","WARNING: my package came without the charging cord. When I asked Amazon to issue a credit so that I could buy a cord on its own they would not offer any solution other than return and refund of the entire item.","So far, very happy with this Chromebook. For my daughter, for college. Very different than a Windows-based computer,  but not too hard to figure out (And there is LOTS off online help and tutorials!)  Would certainly recommend!","I bought this as soon as I got my taxes back because I needed something if I were to keep writing. I got a Chromebook because I only needed something with basic stuff. I did not need anything extra. My accounts are linked to Chrome so the set up was SUPER easy. Sometimes it lags but I don't know if that is because of my network or the laptop itself. Either way, it is not bad at all. I know it's not a touch screen but I had one before this and I kept wanting to select options by touching the screen haha. So it was an adjustment for sure but it works for everything I use it for and I have no real complaints!","Excellent! Use it daily for my remote job. Functions fast and efficiently! Screen is large 15\" with great graphics. In general \"Love it!! \"","Got this for my mom, who surfs the internet, reads emails, watches videos. Her old windows 7 computer had slowed down no matter what I did. Lots of issues with tracking and bad links she had clicked on which loaded it with too much junk. She also has issues understanding all of the pop ups for updating and anti virus messages. This computer solved all of these issues. Pros: - FAST. very fast. Solid State Drive is what makes this scream. No sound or anything. Just speed-wise. - Screen is not reflective. The mat anti-reflective screen is just stunning. - No nonsense. No anti virus. It does not need it!!! wow. What a breath of fresh air. - I powered it up, entered her gmail email address, and that was it. - It updated stuff in seconds, not hours. - Battery life is GREAT. - Pages load instantly. - Huge screen. - Very easy to understand settings. Cons - Really none, unless you want MS word and things like that loaded in. Otherwise, this is not a con at all.","Bought refurbished, had my worries and doubt as I have never bought refurbished before, but read good reviews on the laptop Acer Flagship CB3-532 15.6\" HD Premium Chromebook, so decided to take the dive and buy it.  So far so good the computer arrived as expected not in the original packaging, but the laptop was clean and free of any visible damage, there was no scratches and upon starting it, it booted up rather quickly, is fast and the battery life is amazing.  In general very happy with the purchase and it fits my needs without having breaking bank.","This is exactly what I was looking for! It\u2019s ridiculously easy to set up and use! If you have a GMAIL account it seriously does all the work for you,just put in your email address adjust some settings and there ya go all done lol I didn\u2019t need a laptop for anything too extreme or specific,just wanted to have a place to type papers,listen to music and download pictures so this was perfect for all of that! The price was perfect for me right now too! It came packaged with bubble wrap and a secure box! Everything works on it and it did come with a charging cord \ud83d\ude0a","Start: 3 star I did the setup and had problems setting up my wifi. Everything else connects but this laptop wanted to fight about it. I disconnected the wifi from the laptop and did it again it took the third time. After this I did the set up. I was stuck at the Gmail screen the next wouldn't work then it did. It took at 2 minutes to process before it came up. The finger pad to click seem to not respond to good. It does take a while to load no matter what you are doing. I bought this refurbished so I was at least expecting they cleaned the operating system. It seems to get stuck loading or on an app. I needed a laptop that was affordable which this was but the basics like speed and loading time should be faster then this. Being I NEED the laptop I will work with it. If needed for multi tasking and speed you should probably spend the $60 more for a better one. This is just set up and looking around. I will update later and hopefully it was worth it. I took pictures beginning to end. Also when I took out of box and opened the laptop was on and charged. If you just need for here and there and I think it would work. For travel or business I would just shell out more money. UPDATE: Down to 1 star I can't get into anything or on the internet anymore. I have youtubed and googled nothing is working. My mistake for wishing for more. PLEASE don't waste your time. I can't enjoy my laptop or do anything on it.","My first and probably last chromebook. 1)  Computer arrived in pretty much brand new looking finished.  I easily could have mistook this for a new computer, except that it was still configured as a meeting chromebox and required Acer tech support troubleshoot the issue with me for an hour before being able to login to the computer. 2) OS update allows me to use android apps on the computer.  However, the two apps I use most crash every time i open them.  So I'm back to accessing on them on the browser.  I like my apps better, but apps don't work on this thing, despite what the OS description said.  If you want to access an app or service, its done through your Chrome browser, not the androidapp. 3)  My biggest complaint about this computer is the keyboard.  The genius who designed the keyboard put the SEARCH button directly to the left of the A key.  Since there is no number pad, any experienced typer will have to reorient their typing stance from a center-left position to a dead-center position.  Its extremely cumbersome using the keyboard despite its full size.  Additionally putting the search button directly to the left of the A key is so annoying I'm actually considering prying the key off so I stop accidentally pressing it.  If that search button wasnt in such a stupidly designed location, this would be a 3 star review. The main redeeming value of this computer, and only reason its not a 1 star review is the ease of use in terms of the Chrome OS.  If you know chrome, you already know the computer.  It would have been nice if the seller would have set the puter back to factory stats prior to mailing it.  1 hour of my life wasted troubleshooting that little mix up.","For what I bought it for, it serves its purpose perfectly. I am very happy after using it for a week now. We had a Macbook Air and one of my humans spilled water on it. Game over. Couldn't afford another one so after doing some research this is a perfect band aid for a little picture management and Netflix watching. My daughter uses a Chromebook for her class so this was also a plus. Very budget friendly and we have a laptop again in the household. Update: About 2 weeks into computer , the charger went out. Charger would not charge computer. Uuuugh. Seller had no replacement for it. Remember this is a refurbished item. Be careful. Bought a new charger and is back to good. So computer works great, the process was the bummer.","I wasn't too sure about the reviews on this refurbed Acer Chromebook...... but I am soooo glad I bought it ..... It was shipped free from Acer for $133 and I can't tell it from new !  It boots up very fast and searches the internet with super fast speed. My kids use the smaller screen versions of this at school and love to use this at home. I bought a $700 Dell laptop at the same time as this Chromebook and I have to say I much rather use the Acer Chrome for surfing the net..... It has no dvd drive or hard drive to eat power and make things run hot and slow.....  Battery life is awesome at about 3x longer surfing time than a laptop....and it doesn't get hot.... Has a small solid state drive on the motherboard to save small files like passwords and screensavers.... This is perfect for kids and adults to surf the net, watch Youtube, and access Google online games and software without the complications of running a laptop..... ( great for seniors ) It is not for someone looking to save gigabytes of pictures and files or run windows\/firefox  programs. A+++  The Chromebook is about 1000 x better than I thought it would be......and with the Acer warantee ....a 15\" screen chromebook for $133.......whats not to like","The laptop is great but if you have it closed sometimes it shuts off unexpectedly, so when you turn it back on you have to restore the tabs you had open.","So I ordered this Acer Flagship CB3-532 15.6\" Chromebook that I am currently writing this review on. I placed the order on October 14 and it arrived on October 17, which is AMAZINGLY fast shipping that I did not pay extra for! I bought this laptop for $169, two days after i bought it the price dropped to $133, so pretty disappointed that I didn't even wait longer or no one offered me a discount or something......but anyways.......The laptop is sleek and pretty, no signs of being used. So far I've had no problems but let's be honest, I've only been on it for less than two hours. BUT when I first turned on my new computer it was running very slow (I'm blaming it on the fact that the battery was completely dead when i got it) and sat frozen on third set up screen for almost 30 minutes I was worried my laptop was no good...but it's been fine since then. This isn't my first Chromebook but my old one was smaller so this 15.6\" screen is way better, I just wish it was touch screen.","Wow! This refurbished Acer\/Chromebook is nice! There is no clue it isn't brand new from the factory! It has a simple layout set up for Chrome web browsing, once it's turned on it already has a full charge and welcomes you (the new owner) to easily navigate getting started with step by step instructions. Which is very important when it's a gift for someone not so tech savvy as my 60yr old mother. Moves thru each step quickly, no lag, and provides continued instruction even after set up. Speakers and volume level is loud enough in a quiet place but you may need head phones in a louder atmosphere. Durability may not survive dropping or slamming it around because Amazon originally sent one that somehow was damaged in delivery and had to contact me to send out another. It does come in a bubble case that is pretty darn impressive but clearly still took damage in shipping process soo judgement call would be too not slam it around... i would hope. Battery life is good for now, she charged it over a 4 hour period on Dec 27th two days after Christmas, and has said she hasn't charged it since, today is the 31st! Granted most of us would be streaming video & such which takes a lot of battery life. So you make that judgement call.  And she's played hours of spider solitaire laying in bed. She loves it so I'm happy.","Finally, something easy to get around on! After 13 years my MacBook Pro reached the end of the support line. I thought I would save a few bucks so tried Windows 10. I hated it, gave that laptop away. For many years I have worked with both PC and Mac. This Chrome\/book feels like my old pal Mac. I got the refurbished Chromebook 15 just in case I hated it too. Mine arrived looking brand new, charged and all I needed to do was sign in with my gmail. Finally no more hair-pulling trying to find things. But What? No power cord? WT! Budget friendly, but what an inconvenience.","My'bad' here. This laptop was refurbished, so I tried to save$$$. I did not see the need to add a two year 31$ extended warrenty, as this item was recently 'serviced'. It arrived quickly and in great shape, for being used. It worked just cherry from 5\/15\/2019 until 11\/22\/2019,,,,exactly 6 mo. The 30 day and 90 day return times have expired and I'm screwed. Seller and Amazon were prompt and polite with my inquiry to return this for service or attempt a refund anyway.  My issue is plain and simple,.... I find no reason why a 6 mo. old, newly serviced laptop only lasted 6 mo!!!! All I did was surf the web for information and to shop on Amazon. Never dropped it. Never spilled anything on it. Never slammed it shut. Always kept a good charge on it. One evening I was gathering thanksgiving recipes, shut it down for only about a half hour, went to finish my recipe searches and BAM the sob is DEAD. I used my reliable kindle fire 5 to find possible troubleshooting steps to follow. Yes sir,,,I screwed myself by not buying the extended warranty, but 30\/90 day return warranties are geared for this situation. To force another purchase!!!!!! I will not purchase or recommend an acer product nor use Amazon for the future replacement of this laptop. Again, I see NO REASON why our technologies could turn out such a short lived product.","I was pleasantly surprised by the size and quality of this Acer . the size is perfect and the screen is clear. I will purchase \u00a0another for picture storage.","this has been a great replacement for my apple laptop, which i killed a few months ago. i just couldn't justify the price for a new\/refurbished even, apple, so i tried this. it's great. the screen is slightly 'greyed', which reviews said, so i was prepared. it's a bit annoying, but for the price a worthwhile sacrifice. it charges fast, the battery lasts a long long time, and with a $10 mouse from staples, it's great. useful, convenient, easy to carry, and cheap. do be aware that google will follow you around the internet, but then again so do facebook & many other places.","After being manacled to an ever increasingly logy HP Windows 10, a consistently crashing of IE, which BTW refused to load Chrome browser properly, I bought this Chromebook to replace it.  I have used the Acer 15 CB3-532 (refurbished) every day for one week. It  promised to be fast and it truly is - a difference like night and day compared to Windows.  Any questions\/issues that I have had were quickly answered\/resolved by information readily available online.  Whereas using my older computer was a torturous chore to be avoided if possible, the Acer 15 is a pleasure to use and I look forward to turning it on every day. As I said above, I have only had this device for 1 week and \"we\" are still in the honeymoon phase of our \"relationship.\"","It does its' job.  Connects fine to the Internet, gets my email, watches Twitch and YouTube, etc.  Works well with Google Docs as well.  If i have too many tabs open in my browser the laptop tends to get laggy.  Overall, though you can NOT beat the price.  My first laptop was $2,800 and it had a small gray and black LCD screen and it weight as much as a small elephant, so obviously I have seen a lot of laptop generations.  I never thought we would be at a price point where you could get a computer at this price point -- especially with a 15.6\" monitor and a battery that lasts hours.  The screen could be a little clearer (although I'm old) and I would love a lighted keyboard, but I recommend this computer -- especially at this price point..","The product would not come on. O for contact Acer and they sent me a new charger but the charger wasn't the problem it was the laptop. Acer did approve for be too send the laptop back and they would fix it for free but I waited too late to send it back so now I have to get it fixed myself. So Acer was very helpful and fair I just didn't stay within the time frame to send it back to get it fixed. But I did find a sure who says they could fix it.","I am so pleasantly surprised to have found this computer. The quality is outstanding and it almost feels like a \"steal\" with how inexpensive it was. I'm not a gamer and was looking strictly for something to write\/blog with as well as manage social media and email. My kids are also now at the age where they need to type reports for school, so it's nice to have something easy to use for them. The Chrombooks run off of (surprise surprise) Google Chrome, which is no problem for me as it's my preferred search engine. It easily runs Spotify or Pandora while I type and manages no problem having several tabs open at once. It's a terrific size (not too small) and lightweight. I have a large tote that I like to carry it in. All in all, I highly recommend. You cant go we wrong if you need something simple for basic computer needs.","I\u2019ve had this laptop for a few months. It\u2019s painfully slow compared to my husbands MacBook. The screen is crap because it reflects all light like a mirror. But for $150, how much can you complain, right? Wrong. Today it completely stopped working in the middle of me filling out paperwork. I\u2019ve used the thing maybe 20 times tops. Waste of my time and money.","I do not recommend purchasing! I purchased a new version (not refurbished) of the computer for $159.99. I have only had this computer for about 6 months and I have had continuous problems since I bought it. Most recently, I have noticed a high pitched buzzing noise coming from the computer that I cannot figure out how to get rid of. It is extremely irritating when I am trying to work - I work from home in a quiet environment so it is easy to hear. The only thing that helps drown it out is by playing music. However! The computer is set up to have \"apps\". I downloaded the Spotify app thinking that would work but it always freezes, lags, and then shuts down. So instead I have to play from my browser using the webplayer. I have excellent internet that works quickly with all of my other devices but my internet always seems to lag on my computer. I rarely use any of my devices at the same time other than using my phone while watching streaming services. I bought this computer to use for my business, however, it has proven to not be what I need. The computer in general is slow, lags a ton, and randomly shuts off at times. I was excited about having a computer that was google chrome enabled, but that perk usually is more annoying than it is helpful. I cannot tell you how often I accidentally hit the search button on the keyboard and then it takes me out of the window that I am using. I do not have a ton of items stored on my computer - I primarily use Google Drive. So the fact that my computer is so slow despite having little storage usage is somewhat annoying. A couple of things that I can say good about this computer: 1. The size is good 2. Sound quality is overall pretty good 3. Battery life is surprisingly good 4. The computer is in general light! Overall, I would not recommend buying this computer and I am definitely frustrated that I bought it in the first place. This computer makes it pretty difficult to run a successful business.","I was looking for something lightweight and fast. This is both of those. Going from a Windows OS to the Chrome OS was something I wasn't sure about. I've always used Windows, but I bought my 81 year old mom a Chromebook for Christmas, and she loves it. I figured if she can figure it out, I can too. Setup is simple and straightforward, just log into your Google account, if you have one. If not, you can create one.. I bought a flash drive for pics and files. I added my VPN, that setup was simple too. The price can't be beat, the screen looks awesome and text size can be modified. I'd definitely recommend this","This is my first chromebook and although I am still confused at how to get it to do some things that I've always done on Windows PC, I am impressed. This doesn't act like a refurbished item at all and is very fast. I like that it turns on automatically when I open it. The packaging was plain but very secure and my laptop came without a scatch! I saw some others say they hadn't gotten a charging cable but I think they just missed it. You have to dig all the way to the bottom of the box, where there is smaller piece of cardboard separating the charging cable from the rest of the packaging. I almost missed it myself and was worried I would have to return. Overall, I really like it even though I'm new to chromebook.","This thing isn't terrible, and pretty good if you want something cheap for your kid to take to school. It appears to be pretty durable, though undoubtedly a bit large and heavy for lugging to school as well. My child gave up on it, and now i use it a lot. The screen quality isn't great, colors aren't bright. Not a touch screen, btw. Works just fine for what I use it for though, so if you're looking for something cheap and basic, then this is fine. But please use an external mouse! This thing's touchpad is soooo vexing. it's way too sensitive and makes selections all over the place without me even touching anything. It was happening so much today, that I decided to write this review (after grabbing the mouse).","I give this 5 stars. First, it's only very inexpensive computer. But what you get in screen size and keyboard is very good for the money. I bought this for my church to do QuickBooks Online software. It looks like this was a wise decision since we do not need any onboard storage (computer has some though). I am impressed with the speed and screen brightness. I have watched movies and videos online without problems. I think I may buy one for my family to use. It is solid and does not have any loose or poorly fitting parts, but it is not as solidly built as a MacBook, but what can you expect for 1\/5 fo the price. It is well worth the money I spent. If you have a kid or an older parent this should be a great computer for them because no Windows updates or virus software to fight or confuse the user. Be aware it is Google-centric and takes a google account to fully access all features. I have not tried games or anything like that on the computer but I am impressed with the machine compared to my daughter's Chromebook computer (3-4 years old), it's much snappier and the screen is much better in brightness and clarity.","The laptop is EXTREMELY fast, much better than I anticipated.  I use it to do homework while watching TV, instead of using our desktop.  It's a chromebook, but I search the internet faster than prior gaming laptops I've owned.  The machine runs like a champ.  This was one of the best purchases I've made in the past couple of years.  You usually get what you pay for, but this is a bargain and a great machine.","Love it. It runs fast, I can watch YouTube\/Netflix no problem, the sound is decent, the screen is really big and it's easy to use. No caps key, but I quickly trained myself to hold shift down for a capital letter when necessary, which is often because I use this primarily for my online college classes. Does everything. Had an issue accessing a few web pages at first due to \"privacy issues\" but the problem fixed itself. Haven't met a webpage I cant load.  Highly recommend.","It's a sleek, ready to use\/set up, Windows based computer.  Everything Windows based transfers in, and I was using it immediately after opening it up. Really great for basic Internet use: email, job hunting, Youtube, Facebook, Amazon.com Prime viewing, and shopping. Just don't try to do them all at one time. I bought this quickly, without researching the product, because it was a great price, and I needed something right away. The Internet tends to shut down (crash) for no reason except, perhaps, that I open too many windows\/apps, at one time. It has a definitive limit on how many functions it can handle, before it has a meltdown. More rarely, it will freeze, requiring a complete restart. This is infrequent, and so far, seems to be me, again, using too many functions, at the same time, even though I know better, now. Be aware that some games and apps aren't usable, unlike on my laptop. If there's a way to make them work, I'd rather just find something that is compatible.","This was my first time making a computer purchase on Amazon. Wasnt a big deal since it was for my kids to do homework and with such a reasonable price i figured why not. I was soooo amazed once I opened the package. The computer was refurbished but it looked brand spaking new to me!  I the screen was nice and wide. I seriously wanted to give my children my laptop and keep this 1.This is definitely worth the buy! my daughter is headed to college an i will be making a purchase again to present as a graduation gift. Its not heavy or bulky, again its a great screen size and resolution, everything works as expected! Im really impressed and did i mention the price....very much worth it!","I was skeptical, due to the fact that this computer costs less than 250. My mindset was of the idea of \"You get what you pay for.\" Well, color me surprised because I am blown away by this spicy Chromebook. It gives you the real estate of a full sized computer, with the speed and reliability of a Chromebook. It does better than my Asus laptop,with every advantage on paper. The battery is a hard A+ and these units show that Chromebooks have come a long way and have applications that prevent you from having to settle. I highly recommend it.","My daughter recently change schools and at their old school they needed Apple but at her new school she's used Chromebook. To get a Chromebook at this price is so worth it she is so excited and has no problem navigating through different websites. I'm absolutely buying another one for my sons.  The seller was super nice and sent me an e-mail asking to rate the chrome book and if I have any problems email him which I thought it was very kind.","I wanted to like this computer but I don't. Just about everything I try to download on to the computer including my printer setup it states that it is not compatible or does not support the google operating system. It does me no good if I cannot use it with my apps. It is great for browsing the internet or playing simple games once you figure out the google system. It just does not work for me. I guess I like the windows system better even windows 10 which I hate. I have requested to return this computer but I am expecting to receive a negative response.  I have tried to sell it someone else but after trying to download their programs  (libby and overdrive) and receiving the same message they decided they did not want it.","What a ripoff. I gave 1 star only because it won\u2019t allow me to give none. This seller does not care about their customers. I bought a computer for my son for Christmas and he messed up isn\u2019t he first few weeks, returned it to amazon and had another sent to me in Jan and today it has stopped working. It won\u2019t even turn on. No damage has been done and this seller doesn\u2019t have anything to other than \u201cit\u2019s out of warranty\u201d  no I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having problems since you bought it, or thank you for shopping with us nothing. That\u2019s fine, I may not get any help from this computer but I will make sure no one I know falls for their crappy products.","This laptop has been a nightmare to use. It is not at all comparable to Microsoft Windows as an operating system. It has strange quirks in the keyboard which have been horrible to deal with. Trying to move between even just a few tabs has resulted in pages closing and having to reload. We have fiber optic Internet service, so it's not an internet issue. It also won't let me move between an open word document and internet access. It's been truly awful to use and I recommend avoiding this laptop and the seller, who refused to accept my return. I admit I was slightly past the 30 day window when I tried to make the return, but I was genuinely trying to give myself time to adjust to the laptop, which unfortunately, just did not happen.","I have not used the computer yet, so this review is strictly based upon my disappointment upon receipt of product.  Although description clearly states that all relevant accessories are included, there is no power source cord included! I reached out to Amazon immediately and they offered a gift card for the cost to purchase one.  However, I feel I should warn others about this scenario as it appears I am mot the first customer to experience this problem.  After receiving the item, I read the questions asked area and see that others were just as frustrated as myself due to the lack of power source.  The computer is meant to be a gift for my nephew and was requested specifically by him via Amazon link.  My lesson learned... although a requested gift; READ EVERYTHING before purchase.","I had to give this a mid rating because the manufacturer stated that I could use the external cd\/rw with no problem and it wouldn\u2019t connect when I contacted acer I was told that I wouldn\u2019t be able to down load a driver that would work with this laptop nor would I be able to connect my cloud printer! I was disappointed that I bought external items that I was told would work and didn\u2019t. I had no problem adding these items to my brothers HP windows laptop! Because it\u2019s run on google is the problem! Would I recommend it yes for for the price I guess you can\u2019t have all the bells and whistles!","pretty much only purchased this to transfer media files from a broken hp. some of the files work fine, others don\u2019t - i can\u2019t pinpoint the issue. Apps crash often. had to google on my phone how to reboot it when it froze after two days. (toggle refresh key- arrow circle key near left corner, and power key at same time). keyboard is weird, it\u2019ll take time to adjust. it was cheap so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f ^wrote this after a few weeks. it has now been 6 months. i was trying to set up my moms internet with it (it also doesn\u2019t have a ethernet cable port which i just found out)... the screen started blinking. i shut the top down and now it won\u2019t charge, turn on, or reboot with the refresh\/power trick. OH WELL BYE BYE CHROMEBOOK","Slow computer. Hard to use more than a few tabs at once. Due to a chrome setting that I've been unable to disable on this OS, switching between tabs causes each tab to refresh. This slows down productivity a lot. For navigating within and between sites within a single tab, it's quick enough. As a dirt cheap backup PC for emailing and streaming, this laptop definitely gets the job done. For more complicated tasks, you're going to be sitting around waiting for the job to complete.","False advertising... Switch & Bait. I recieved 11.6 this is advertised as 15.6 I bought these for Christmas presents. Glad I opened it and when I also bought cases 15.6 that I now have to return. I suggest you review what you paid for versus what you received. Contacted seller no reply yet. I am ok with the size. I want a refund for the difference.","This is my first laptop\/Chromebook. I am everything Google, so this works out perfectly! I use a desktop computer and my cell ph mostly, but needed something for downstairs which this works great. It came fully refurbished, clean. Their is 2 scratch marks barely noticeable on the casing, but other than that and for the price of under $150.00 I feel I got an awesome deal.","Excellent price. I know it was refurbished but you wouldn't know it. The package came with a very heavy bubble wrap, which protected the computer. The set up was plug and ready. I love this Chromebook is the best. I have had Asus chrome books and  I feel that the Acer is the best. I love the large screen. I love it so much that I ordered another one for my husband. I would recommend this Acer to everyone. Easy to operate and fast. Also, don't forget that it has its own Antivirus build right in the computer.","i had this for about 7 months and its still going strong. it hasn't broke down on me yet. i mainly use it to browse the web i don't make youtube videos or do heavy task ect.. so this is perfect for me. and if i want to play a game i go on my consoles and do that. i use to browse on my tablet alot but since i got this bad boy this killed my beloved tablet. if you want a buy a laptop without spending 500-1000 dollars(im looking at you apple!) go for a chromebook and its incredibly fast once you turned it on it only takes less then 3-2 minutes to turned on.","This Chrome book looked like brand new and works great. You have to be connected to the internet to use it. It is great for browsing and you don't need to worry about viruses. The built in storage is just to operate the device, not for downloading and saving lots of data. If you just want to be able to browse the internet without having to worry about viruses and malware this is for you.","Purchased for my son.  Others had more features, but my son wanted a large screen and he was initially very happy.  EXCEPT he says space bar does not work well. I wish he had let me buy him one with more RAM, more GB, SSDL --there were several available with a bit smaller screen. Had we gotten one of those, he would probably be happier.  He recently told me, \"A smaller screen would be ok.\"  Unfortunately, as far as I know, it is too late for an exchange. I would be thrilled to purchase him a better one!","My girlfriend loves it! Big screen, decent speakers on the sides, USB ports, easy to use, great price. Only con is the touchpad isn't the greatest, but with all the pros this Chromebook has, can't even complain that much.","I bought this to replace a 6 year old Samsung Chromebook which I have loved until it finally quit.  This Acer is much bigger with its 15.6\" screen.  Right out of the box, as usual the setup was almost instant, and I love the feel of the keyboard.  I saw a sticker saying to open from both ends to find cord, and it is hard to notice when you're excited to get the chromebook out of its packing.  Don't throw the cord away!  It was packed very well. So far I love it, and will update if I find it isn't what I thought, but I bought it for the price, size, and the fact that it was a Chromebook.  Very impressed with the quality so far!","This is my first Chromebook PC. I bought this refurbished so I didn't expect perfection, but it's just right for me until I upgrade to soemething else. It has been very reliable and easy to use. The speakers are at a nice loud volume and it works well with a handheld mouse and just as well! on the mouse on the touchpad. The price was great too!","I bought this for my Partner to replace an older chromebook. She loves it.It set up easy and she seems to be really happy with it. I never thought about buying Refurbished, but now I'm sorry that I didn't do it before. I bought a new laptop at Best Buy and could have gotten a much better one that was refurbished for the price that I paid. Go REFURBISHED","Our kid can't seem to hang on to\/not spill juice on\/not randomly ruin laptops. We purchased this re-furbished Chromebook because it's so cheap {sorry, kiddo.} I quickly set it up. The Chromebook has yet to pick up any viruses...which is amazing considering the websites the kid visits. The Chromebook has a great battery life (all day if he's using it for school work.) AND the kid (while he misses his long line of gaming laptops) actually likes the Chromebook.","I received the laptop and loved it. I'm not too picky. BUT it wasn't long before i realized the colors were totally off. The only way I can describe it is that the colors are washed out. They aren't vivid. I asked amazon support, they simply sent me another one. I searched google and tried a couple things, but nothing has worked to fix the colors. The second laptop was the same. Now, i'm thinking it's an issue with the model. I need it to edit photos, so this issue is very frustrating for me.","the product is very used, and has many visible blows, which classifies it as class C. I feel very disappointed by the team, now I will have to spend a lot of money to place a case","the only thing I liked about this \"laptop\" was its size. Its start up menu was not easily accessible. It constantly shut down while I was in the middle of working on something, sometimes as quickly as 2-3 minutes after I logged on. It would shut down at least 2-3 times in a row. If you are use to a computer with a start up menu and icons easily seen and understood, this is NOT for you.","When I first opened my package, the charger was already damaged. The laptop looked solid and decent for the price, but what's the entire point of using a laptop when you can't even charge it?!? What disappointed me the most was the fact that I had to pay for shipping back.","The touchpad is the worst Ive ever seen. It stops, it drags, locks up, and when it does work finding the bar on right is a whole new annoyance in itself...barely visible! This is probably the worst product Ive bought from Amazon. (over 100). They say you get what you pay for.  I trusted the reviews as always.","Ordered for my mom who is 75 years old and needs a basic computer. Although she complains that it is too heavy for her (she has weak upper body strength), it serves it's purpose. All she does is surf the net, check her bills, and watch youtube. The speed is fine for someone who is just needing a basic computer and the price was PERFECT for someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money for a fancy computer. CHECK THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX FOR THE CHARGER BEFORE YOU THROW IT AWAY. IT was hidden in the box and I had to read the reviews thoroughly to check for it before I called Amazon.","It is incredibly basic, but for the price you couldn\u2019t really ask for much more. It is for browsing the web and literally only that, has no other functions. Battery life is good and I am getting up to 6 hours of use at a time.","Very satisfied with this. Up and working on it within minutes of opening the box.","My kids took over my other computers, so I decided to get one of my own.  I enjoy the convenience of having a personal computer where all my passwords are mine, etc.  This computer is sometimes a little slow, which was disappointing.  But I suppose that it what I get with a dual-core.  It doesn't have any other issues. I use it for email, social media, google docs and spreadsheets, calendar, YouTube, online shopping, and the like.  I don't use it for gaming or music, so I can't say how it would do for that.  It holds a charge very well!","Like the fast boot time, quick maintenance update time and value (lower cost).  Google's Chrome browser and Google brand Apps work great.  However, non-Google Android apps may or may not work great or may not work at all.  Recommended for people who only need good Google branded app performance.  Not recommended for people who need good non-Google app performance.  I'm not a \"power-user\" and sometimes wait patiently a few seconds for an app to refresh or respond to a mouse click.  Occasionally, perhaps monthly, the screen \"freezes\" and I must press and hold down the power button for many seconds to power off\/on the device.","My old machine was not updateable anymore, so crashed repeatedly.  This is a good replacement for someone who is not computer savvy and just needs the basics to access the internet, email, etc.  That's all I require of it.  The keyboard is smaller and takes some getting used to and I do miss the number pad , but otherwise has a nice touch to it.  A good size screen for the money too.  And could not beat the price!","The computer won't even turn on only a few months in.  I've tried all of the official hard reset and restart methods and nothing works.","The screen is broken in less than two months and the Acer Refurbished Store is saying tough luck. Really?? Save your money and get something that won\u2019t break after 2 months you can\u2019t return.","How many chromebooks have I owned?  Maybe 6.  I leave them with families in Latin America when I'm heading home.  Refurbs, like this one, are often hard to distinguish from new.  The smaller models are way light and portable.  This larger model will stay on my desk where the screen is big and good enough for me to ignore the TV.  I have had HP and Samsung but like Acer the best.","This was purchased as a gift for my mother-in-law. The unit shipping quickly and arrived in good shape. It looks good on the refurbish  (no scratches or markings)  and seemed to work well for about the first month and then she started having problems with two of the keys on the keyboard sticking. It doesn't make it unusable, it's just frustrating to her, otherwise I would have given it five stars.","It's OK--I was disappointed that after just a few months the action on the touchpad would deteriorate to the point where we can't use it to scroll down anymore on the screen and have to use the arrow keys--the action was always a little \"sticky\" from the get-go but now, it's even worse. I get that this is second hand, but I was hoping for the mechanics to survive longer--luckily we can switch to a mouse--","It was a gift,  they are very happy with their Acer... I though It was a regular laptop but it  was what they call a tablet??? as long as they are happy I am happy!","My 10 yrs. old son love it. screen is so big and enough fast to process. I think it is very good for school kids to do their homework, net surfing and watching Youtube. and I don't feel it's refub product. Great price.","I like this Acer computer. I have never owned an Acer before but it seems to get the job done for what I use it for, which is mostly email and searches. I don't use it for gaming and it doesn't have a touch screen.  I like the separate numerical keyboard better but this is fine for the cost. The price was right and it serves my purpose well.","I got this laptop on Amazon Prime day for a great price. I just needed something to be able to surf the web or occasionally get on Netflix. This is the perfect laptop for just that. I haven\u2019t tried downloading anything to it or saving pictures so I am not sure about storage space but it\u2019s quick, and battery holds up perfectly! Very happy with my purchase","This 15.6\" used Acer Chromebook works as well as the 14\" one I bought about four or five years ago. It's ideal for surfing the web, checking Gmail, and accessing basic docs and spreadsheets created in Google. While the battery, processor, and RAM size are all average (and that's not to say bad), the bright, clear screen is a real stand-out: I can easily watch movies or YT on here without missing the TV screen. Very pleased with this purchase.","I got this after returning another chromebook that felt flimsy and was so slow. The great part is I only paid $30 more for this one that has a bigger screen, solid construction, and fast processing. Buy it.","Fails to recognize most of my files. Difficult to do even the simplist tasks. (like Spell check). Fails to recognize video extentions, will stop playing in the middle of a video.  Not worth the money, yes cheap is cheap here. Pure Junk","I am agraid to get a chromebook because a lot of reviews claim they do not stream hulu or Netflix. I have found the computer does just that without any problems. I am getting use to the performance quirks, like no right clicking the traditional way and some other things. But a quick trip to google solved all my problems.","Bought as a replacement for a low end Acer Chromebook purchased years back. That cheap unit met the needs of my wife until the screen was accidentally cracked. She picked out this refurbished unit as a replacement. It came well packaged, and looks and operates as if brand new. It is a bit bigger than she wanted, but in all other regards it is perfect.","Needed this laptop to stream online video to a weekly group.  Works well and the picture is very clear.  Well worth the price."],"14":["I've found three real cons for this laptop: 1. The screen isn't the best, but it is acceptable. Doesn't compare to my i7, 4k touchscreen laptop, but it's also about $800 cheaper. 2. The 1tb HDD is very slow, only 5400 RPM (really common on laptops without an SSD). 3. The memory installed is a single 4gb and a second 2gb module, so no dual channel. Really, under 8 gig of memory, just say no. When using the on CPU graphics, this is a serious handicap (not dual channel). Pluses: Built in DVD drive. Probably not important to a lot of people nowdays, but a plus still. Latest gen CPU from Intel, the i3 may be pretty mediocre, but if you are comparing it to a machine 3 years old, you'll be VERY happy. VERY easy access (3 small phillips head screws) to upgrade memory, hard drive, and an empty M.2 slot for an SSD (screw & standoff included). I've read people complaining that upgrading it themselves was \"not easy\". Acer unlike most companies makes it easy to upgrade, but it does require knowledge. The system as configured is indeed a cheap laptop, and poor performer. You can make it a very pleasant midrange performer by upgrading memory and adding an SSD. The SSD would give you the most noticeable improvement, the memory would allow more open tabs on your browser. Upgrade details: First get an 8 gig or larger USB stick. I used this: https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kingston-Digital-8GB-Traveler-Flash\/dp\/B00G9WHMHC\/ Then go to Microsoft and use their media creation tool to create a bootable Windows 10 installer (64 bit). Use a #0 tip phillips head screwdriver to remove the 3 screws on the cover on the bottom. There is a small notch on one corner of the cover, pry it up from there (yes, it can seem like you'll break it). When you open the cover, to the left would be a hard drive, I recommend removing it. Just slide it to the left away from the connector it is plugged into, it's stiff, but once unplugged you can lift it out. Next to the two filled memory slots on the right, between the two memory sticks and the HDD, is the M.2 slot, and down toward you on the circuit board is the standoff that Acer has kindly provided the screw for. Remove the screw, slide your SSD at an angle into the M.2 slot, once seated (can't see the gold fingers on the dge of the SSD), it should hinge down to the top of the spacer, insert the screw you removed and tighten gently. Next, the two memory dimms, pop them out by taking the two levers (one on each side) and gently pulling away from the dimms, they should pop up. Angle in the two (matching) memory dimms, and again when seated properly (can't see the gold edge connecters) angle them down and the two latches should pop into place. Put the cover back on. Insert the USB key drive. Power it up, should boot into installing Windows 10. Select \"custom Install\". Select new install (not upgrade). Should bring up a screen to select the disk drive, if you've removed the hard drive and have a new SSD, just select the only drive and tell it to use it. If you've tried and failed on your SSD, delete all the disk partitions, and let it use the blank disk (no need to create partitions, format, or anything, just remove all the existing partitions). Microsoft will automatically read the license key where it is stored in non-volatile memory. Takes about 20-30 minutes to fully install windows, reboot, connect to a network, and install updates. This gives you a nice machine with dual channel memory, and an SSD. You can reinstall the HDD and format it to use as extra storage (that's what I did). It'll now boot in about 15 seconds to your desktop in Windows 10 if you use the two cheap options below. Might boot faster with the NVME drive, but you really won't notice. Bonus, nice clean install of Windows 10, without \"extra\" programs you don't need. WD Blue 3D NAND 500GB PC SSD https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Blue-NAND-500GB-SSD-WDS500G2B0B\/dp\/B073SBX6TY\/ Memory 16gb dual channel (2x8gb DDR3 PC3L-12800 204 PIN SODIMM) https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00KEAEX54\/","SUMMARY The E 15 is a fast computer with plenty of ports and great battery life, but the washed out screen holds it back. DESIGN With a bevy of ports including VGA and a DVD drive, plus its heavy weight, the E 15 screams \"work computer!\"  This isn't a bad thing, because it also feels substantial, including the monitor hinge.  Many laptops in this price range feel like they need to be babied to survive long.  There is a physical Ethernet port, an HDMI port, three USB 3.0 ports, and up to date 802.11ac WiFi.  One nice touch is that the matte plastic has that brushed look, giving it a bit more traction and style.  More importantly, and unlike many modern laptops, it is easy to service or upgrade. PERFORMANCE The 8th gen Core i3 2.2 Ghz CPU and 6 GB memory combine to give swift performance for most common tasks like word processing, web browsing in many tabs, and streaming video.  One shocking thing to me is how well it handled running its own 1080p screen, a second 1080p screen over USB 3.0, and a third 2560x1440 screen all at once without issue.  I was running multiple HD video streams and web browsing at the time on different screens.  My previous laptop that cost much more and had a dedicated GPU dropped a lot of frames in this configuration. I only notice the weaker CPU compared to my more expensive laptop with CPU intensive or heavy 3D tasks.  If you are running those, including things like gaming beyond the basics or rendering video, this may not be the right choice.  With that said, at this price, there is no great solution. I see another review talking about how slow the computer is, which makes me wonder if Windows was still installing updates.  Any new computer is going to be slow while all that happens in the background.  The network is being pushed, the hard drive is being run heavily, and the CPU is periodically busy.  The only thing noticeably slow is startup.  An SSD upgrade would speed things up substantially. SOFTWARE While I have to use Mac OS and Linux for work, Windows 10 is my favorite OS.  It is flexible and easy to work with, with the most support for hardware and usually no headaches installing new devices.  This version of Windows 10 is almost clean, but includes a few things that I would delete.  Namely, Norton Antivirus, which can cause issues and slowdown.  It is easy to delete and Windows 10 has an antivirus built in. DISPLAY It is obvious where costs were cut to get the low price when you see the monitor in action.  It has a large bezel, which is not such a big deal.  However, the colors are washed out and even more washed out when not looking directly at it.  It is one of the worst screens I have seen in a long time, and the main reason for dropping my score.  It is passable, but I would personally spend a little more for a screen with better blacks and sharper details if I was going to do a lot of writing on it. While people rarely use laptops outside, the screen is also not bright enough for that.  As someone who usually cranks down the brightness to save my eyes, that aspect is fine with me. If you are going to be docking it and using standalone monitors, it supports higher resolutions well. INTERFACE There is no touch screen, which I surprisingly miss because touch controls are so good in Windows 10.  But, they aren't critical.  The keyboard has nice travel and a proper full layout.  The trackpad isn't as responsive as a high end laptop and the clicks aren't as snappy, but it works properly and I haven't had to fight with it. BATTERY Wow, the long battery life is so much better than my previous laptop, whichcould last through a movie and then be done for.  This is likely due to the newest Intel CPUs being built for low power consumption in combination with Acer's lack of concern over a big heavy battery.  The result is that, as long as I charge it at night, battery life just isn't a concern.  There is even a charging port for phones or tablets that is functional with the laptop off, making this a replacement for USB batteries. The charging itself could be improved, with a relatively large power brick.  I was hoping they allowed charging over USB, but I don't think that is available.  I could be missing how to do it. EDIT: I forgot to mention the bright blue light that stays on when it is charging and shut down.  It is very annoying to have it in my bedroom.  A bit of electrical tape fixes it, but I wish it wasn't there to begin with.","Bought this as a gift for my dad.. he just needed something to surf the web and play videos.  I bought this along with a 256GB ADATA SSD ($55) that I immediately installed with no issues.  The panel at the back has 3 screws that need to be removed and has a notch on one side that can be used to pry it open, it requires a little pressure to pop out but not too much.  You will find a m.2 slot to pop in a SATA3 ssd.  The retaining screw is included. Once the SSD is installed you need to go into disk management (Start > type \"Disk Management\") and format the new SSD drive as NTFS and it will assign a drive letter etc. After that plug in a USB flash drive and download Windows 10.  I created installable media on the USB flash drive, then went into the BIOS (press F2 at the Acer logo) and changed the boot order to USB, restart and follow the prompts to install on the new SSD.  When you are ready to reboot remove the USB and it will boot into the new Win10 on the SSD, you may get a menu that gives you the option to choose the boot drive.  To remove the mutliple boot options start msconfig (Start > type \"Msconfig\") Boot tab and delete the HDD boot option.  Then you can reformat the HDD. Quick observations - Display - I think it's fine, has classic TN panel issues but that is fully expected at this price point.  If you're looking at the display head on then it has a nice picture, brightness is average but overall it's acceptable.  For an entry level laptop I would say the Display is acceptable.  Pics of direct and off angle are attached in low light indoors conditions. HDD - Do not even think of using this laptop with the supplied HDD, it is a slow as hell... using an SSD makes the performance increase about 1000% so the only way I would use this is with installing an SSD.  The boot time with the HDD is about 1-2 minutes, with an SSD it's about 5-7 seconds so I make my point!!!  The Crystal Diskmark scores for the SSD and HDD are attached to see the difference. Trackpad - I just use an external mouse, my favorite is the M187 wireless from Logitech, mini mouse that costs $10... I hate all trackpads even on laptops that cost 4 times the price of this so just get an external mouse. Build quality - I would say that it is really nice, a bit flimsy may be but laptops are all flimsy, I have a $1000 surface that I don't think I would want to test it's toughness by dropping it so I think it's silly to debate toughness on a laptop, they are all relatively delicate - the Acer is well put together and looks nice. Battery life - pretty great, I got about 8 hours of continuous use which is phenomenal. Given the price this is a crazy good deal and most definitely exceeds expectations.","original 07\/11\/18 - purchase date update 11\/13\/18 - still quite happy with this laptop...works well so far.. update 03\/10\/19 - still quite happy with this laptop...works well so far.. update 10\/17\/19 - still quite happy with this laptop...works well so far.. original review written on 7\/17\/18 If you are willing to install a 128gb SSD M.2 2280 card ($22.00) and reinstall windows 10 onto the SSD then this is a 5 star product.  Comes with bloatware and who knows maybe some foreign spyware that the reinstall of Win10 removes.  After installing the 128gb SSD and reinstalling windows 10 it performs extremely well for a $380 dollar laptop.  Installing the 128gb SSD is very easy by removing 3 screws holding the drive\/memory cover on the bottom and slipping in 128gb SSD M.2 2280 card.  Reinstalling windows 10 is not that hard but it is much more involved.  Download and use the Microsoft Media Creation Tool (google this tool for helpful articles) to create a USB stick with Win10 Home and then boot from the usb stick (you may need to change a bios setting to boot from the usb stick rather than HDD) and windows will install itself in 30 minutes. You will be surprised that when you are done that it was just not that hard.  If you do the above you have a clean and fast machine. Notes on Win10 Install onto the 128gb SSD - note you will be installing Win10 to the SSD not the 1TB HDD so if you do not succeed you still can boot Win10 from the 1TB HDD - you can leave the network cable disconnected and\/or wifi connection disabled during the Win10 install.  You do not need a microsoft online account to install Win10....you actually may not want microsoft online account to reduce the data collected about you by microsoft....of course if you are using some of microsoft online services then you will need one...i prefer to disable Cortana and i do not use OneDrive. - during the Win10 install make sure you have selected the 128GB SSD and not the 1TB HDD drive - during the install you can remove all the partitions on the SSD card and the Win10 install will recreate the partitions it needs. - after the Win10 install go into the Bios and ensure the SSD is marked as the boot drive - after the Win10 install and reboot run a microsoft update to get Win10 up to date...this will take 60 minutes - after installing Win10 disable microsoft data collection by going into Settings\/Privacy and turn everything off. - it is best to go thru every single Win 10 setting (yes it is quite painful) and turn off all the features that border on privacy invasion such as allowing apps access to location data, allowing all apps to access the camera...it goes on and on...etc... - once you are booting Win10 from the SSD you can reformat the 1TB C:\/ drive to recover the space and use it to store data.

The laptop features the Intel i3-8130U 8th generation (latest generation for 4\/2018, a 2 core processor), a 1TB drive and 6gb RAM.  The battery is supposed to last for 12 hours (I tested this a bit but not a lot).  The laptop has 6gb, a read\/write DVD drive, and a lot of connections and a 1920 x 1080 display. The laptop is responsive and  snappy for an under $400 laptop.  I\u2019m a bit perplexed by some of the reviews claiming this to be slow.  It is not.  This value laptop has some chops.  I loaded my desired suite of applications with Ninite dot com, that went quickly. In testing performance, I ran a Netflix movie and a show on YouTube at the same time with no performance degradation.  I ran the 2+ hour movie twice while doing other stuff on the laptop and the battery still showed over 7 hours left. This laptop has a lot of connectors: USB, HDMI, and even a VGA connection (which I would suggest dropping, if you need that just put a HDMI\/VGA adapter in your computer bag).  Also included is the R\/W DVD drive... something becoming rare in laptops.  A nice option to watch movies if desired. The laptop display is good but has a poor viewing angle.  I wasn\u2019t surprised, my guess is that this is the display was where trade-offs were made to get the laptop to this price.  The display is hard to see from the side (a witty salesperson would claim this is great for privacy) and required tilting the display forward\/back more than I liked to obtain the best viewing angle from the front. The speakers surprised me.  The speaker volume is typical to most laptops in that I wish it would be about 20% louder at max.  The speakers seems to be nice but not amazing, at least until I was lying on a couch watching a movie with the laptop on my chest.  The nearness of my ears to the speakers allowed me to hear a very nice spacial mix of the sound.. the movie sound track \"bloomed\" at that point and was surprisingly good.  Bear in mind, I practically had to have the laptop a foot or two from my face for this to kick in. Overall, for sub $400, this is a very nice performing laptop.","I\u2019m not the most tech savvy person on earth. My old PC was starting to become unreliable, and I knew I needed to replace it before it died. I did a bit of comparison shopping on Amazon, and decided on this Acer. It has lots of space and is fast enough for me. I do not play games on this laptop, so I don\u2019t know anything about graphics, etc. I feel I got a great laptop for the price, and it suits my simple needs.","Very happy-shipping was prompt & product worked out of the box.--have only had small issues w\/Windows 10, after experience w\/Windows7 & Chrome (wife still prefers Chrome)  Wehave found Cortana the voice Assistant to be very helpful, when neither of us thought it would matter. Screen picture quality is fine-really don't know what people expect, especially at under $400.. SOUND IS WAY BETTER THAN EXPECTED, & WE BOTH LOVE OUR MUSIC.. Everything works & is well laid out. The speed is like greased lightning, compared to our old equipment  I appreciate the ease of serviceability offer by Acer on the bottom-only 3 screws. On the downside : it took us about 2 weeks to remove almost all the \"bloatware\", once we knew what some of them were-we kept very little.  Simply too much time was involved here & would appreciate a cut of at least 50%. Even tho we don't need it yet, we would have appreciated 2 gb more ram, & a backlit keyboard.-we would have been willing to pay more! I am 69 & the wife is 62-and we are NOT techies, but folks who consider a computer to be a necessary evil\/","This is a great laptop if you immediately run maintenance checks on it (defrag, disk cleanup) and remove a little bloatware. It is not a laptop to game with, but as a working\/school laptop, you're getting a great bang for your buck. Only giving it four stars just because of the above mentioned things I did afterward, but by no means is this a horrible laptop.","Started out good, but became increasingly slow with updates.  I got rid of the bloat and this thing struggles to open programs and browser pages.  I want to like this, but it is irritatingly slow!","Worked great for about 2 weeks, then became very slow to load and respond. Scanned for virus, but unable to figure out why it was running so slow. Returning it for a refund.","I bought this May 15, 2018 based on reviews.  It stopped working yesterday, rather started working strangely.  Today I called for tech support only to find the warranty expired at 6 months.  The tech support person was kind and knowledgeable but did not tell me that my service expired until he found what he said was corrupted data and that he would be able to fix the data if the for a fee of $129 for a year other options for 2 and 3 years at higher rates.  I decided I wanted to get a second opinion and took it to a local computer shop who told me that the hard drive was bad. The cost of a new hard drive, reinstall the operating system, recover my data files and transfer to the new hard drive was quoted just under the total amount I paid for the computer at $379.  The hard drive going bad at 7 months, I am very disappointed and disturbed. Up until the hard drive failure, I really enjoyed my Acer.  Unfortunately, I would not recommend this computer.","Fantastic product. This laptop is a step up from the previous product which only had the skylake 6 series. The 8th gen processor handles some really impressive things for the price. The only thing is that pesky 5400rpm hard drive. Simply buy a 2.5\u201d ssd and a Sata to USB adapter. Plug the drive into the pc and use macrium reflect to copy the drive as soon as the computer is set up. Then pop out the old drive and insert the new ssd. It blows even my aging desktop out of the water. Even without a discreet card the graphics are impressive. It easily outputs 4K with less than 50% draw on integrated graphics. Although it might be limited for rendering and such. My biggest qualm is that the older model had a backlit keyboard that was great. I would have gladly paid 400 for this laptop if it only had that backlighting. As far as budget laptops go this acer is fantastic.","So far so impressive! From what everyone else was saying I didnt expect much. But it's just what I need. I was surprised to kno its run by microsoft & not google. You need a Microsoft account to setup this bad boy so if you're an xbox\/outlook kind of person all the better, this pc is for you! Just like \"ok google\" \"Bixby\" & \"Alexa\". This has \"Cortona\" idk if she's a Microsoft or a windows 10 thing but she's voice activated & apart of this laptop, she's very helpful. I thought I was unable to get a lot of stuff on this device, but you can. You have to build it, it's like it comes empty so to speak aside from the preinstalled apps, you can uninstall & install the drivers & apps you like, like a media player, google play, & if u need more memory it's an option too on amazon, All hope is not lost' its cooperative & leave room for what u want to install. If ur an IT u can put it to good use & if not, it's simple for those  who aren't. I feel fortunate to have gotten this laptop at this price. You can play roblox, minecraft & probably fortnite. It also has a CD\/DVD drive\/burner, it holds battery life for 12hrs. Think about' your going to pay a good 800 for another. It's a steal to me!","I bought this for work because I dont need a lot of fancy features to email and use microsoft office.  Within a few days computer randomly cut off and I thought it was something I had done wrong.  But it has done it several more times within the last two week in the middle of while I was working.  One time it did it when I unplugged the power cord (yes it was fully charged).  I know other people feel like they have a good product here but I feel like I got what I paid for with a discount computer","Absolutely horrible.... the SLOWEST computer I\u2019ve ever had from the minute I turned it on. Takes about 10 minutes to load up and forget about searching the internet for something...it\u2019s so SLOW!!! My 10 year old laptop filled with 5000 pictures is faster than this laptop","I loved the price for the 8th generation Intel Core i3. I didn't like that the correct Intel UHD Graphics 620 video driver was not installed. I had to go to Intel's website, download and install the right driver, which did then improve performance over the Microsoft Basic video driver. The hard drive is painfully slow. Upgrade to an SSD ASAP. I purchased 8gb to replace the one 2gb stick. The laptop comes with one 4 gb and one 2gb of mismatched memory. Still, overall a good deal for an under $400 laptop. With 12gb ram and without the SSD upgrade Fornite plays on Low between 30-50fps. Very playable. The 14-year-old I purchased this for just had to try playing this game. Edit: Conducted tests using Intel's  Extreme Tuning Utility. I've added some screen shots. Notice when running Fornite, the laptop requires more than 8GB of ram.","I bought this laptop few weeks ago and am overall very happy with the purchase. However, as others have suggested, there are three things you should consider to do in order to reach this laptop's full potential: 1) Delete all the bloatware's that comes with the laptop. The laptop comes with a lot of programs like Norton (only 30 days free trial) which slows the laptop a lot, constantly keeping HDD usage at 100%. You should go into control panel -> uninstall programs and remove all the unecessary programs. 2) You might want to defrag the HDD. Out of the box, the HDD that comes with the laptop was 23% defragmented. To defrag, type \"defragment\" in your windows search bar and Windows 10's defrag and optimize drive tool should show up. Click \"optimize\" to start defragging the HDD. Optimizing it made a heck load of difference for my laptop. 3) Add in an SSD M.2 2280 as a primary drive (for OS, boot and your most used files\/programs) and use the 1TB HDD as secondary drive. There are loads of online tutorials which shows you how to do this. For me, I bought a 256gb m2 2280 SSD on Amazon, opened up the removable panel on the back of the laptop, removed the silver screw (SSD slot is located beside the RAM), slot the SSD in, used a random cloning software I found online to clone the files in the HDD to the SSD, removed and cleaned the HDD and set my booting priority to the SSD. There are tons of ways you can do this and after the process, it takes only 3-5 seconds for the laptop to boot from shut down, and with the 8th gen i3 CPU, the performance is beyond impressive for its price.","I bought this laptop for my sophomore who wanted one in his dorms to do his home work, mostly browsing, and MS office (or equivalent). The feature I am most impressed with is its long battery life, wow, just wow. The laptop looks good, it feels good, its light weight and relatively thin. Its keyboard is not that great, feels little flimsy and it perhaps is flimsy. Like some other reviewers have mentioned, the screen colors are not vivid and it was real pain to watch some old low resolution movies; the colors were acceptable for more recent movies though. Sound, well, thats kind of weak too but some decent quality bluetooth speakers\/headphones can be connected without much hassle. Now the weakest feature that literally flushes this otherwise fine laptop's performs down the drain is its hard drive. I know laptop hard drives are generally not the fastest, and on all my laptops I have replaced them with SSDs, but on this computer, its really really slow. Maybe its because the windows 10, maybe its because the RAM is shared (with the graphic chip), I don't know. I tossed out the existing 1TB hard drive and replaced it with with a $45 Kingston SSD (A400 SSD 240GB SATA 3 2.5\u201d Solid State Drive SA400S37\/240G, also from Amazon). The difference in performance was something. It appeared that I was dealing with an entirely different laptop and not the one I un-boxed and booted just a few hours ago. Now for laymen a 1TB hard drive is a good incentive, and well, it does offer lots of space to store all kinds of data, photos, movies, songs etc. However, if the performance of the laptop is so sluggish with a barely 5% full hard drive, just imagine what kind of a performance you will get with like 50% or more full hard drive? With files scattered all over the place, the performance gets deteriorated and badly. Files can always be stored on flash drives or SD cards (you can buy very large capacity flash drives or SD cards for reasonable price), they can also be stored on external hard drives, or even on the DVD-RWs. So if you want to stick to a slow hard drive for capacity, you may want to revisit your approach. To sum up, its a fine laptop, its large screen, long battery life, and light weight are important pluses, and with a SSD (a minimum of 240 gb of course), it rocks. Its no gaming laptop, and to be honest with you, that was one of the reason I chose it for my sophomore LOL, but its a reasonable laptop for home\/office related jobs. Its performance can certainly be improved significantly by adding RAM. Its two slots are occupied with 4 and 2 gb RAM modules which means to upgrade it, you will have to literally toss out the 2gb module. A single module 8 gb costs less than $40; 8 gb + 4 gb, 12 gb is going to make this computer a good multitasking machine for sure. And yes, you can always sell your 1TB hard drive for like $30-40 on ebay or letgo or similar sites. Or you can convert it into an external hard drive. You need something called an 'enclosure', they convert your regular hard drive into an external hard drive and cost less than $30.","I set my expectations low with the price point of this laptop, but expected it to function at the very least. Unfortunately it cannot. It\u2019s incredibly slow, which isn\u2019t a big deal, expected at $360, but it will not update. I cannot get windows to update. I had it downloading updates for 5 hours and the final download wouldn\u2019t pass 6% even after sitting for over an hour for this download alone. If you use the internet at all do not purchase this. Web pages take a while to load, or won\u2019t load completely, regardless of browser. Meanwhile I hop on my desktop, phone, any other device and the internet works flawless so I know my internet is fine. Went through and updated all the drivers without any success. Videos won\u2019t load either. Yeah, the screen is 1080p, but if you try to watch a random youtube video at just 720p, it cannot go more than 5-10 seconds without buffering for 3-4x that amount. I tried resetting the laptop and have spent hours attempting to make this work. Maybe a defective model, but something is definitely wrong. My old HP Pavilion that was 5 years old worked better. If you purchase this laptop make sure you have a smartphone or something so you can watch youtube videos to bypass the wait of loading your favourite homepage or email. Aside from all of the cons, the battery life seems decent. Probably because the computer is barely functional and the battery is quite literally just powering the screen. I think the HDD takes a nap or something once it wears itself out from starting up. Touchpad is okay, fairly responsive, comfortable to use. This is definitely a place where you feel what you paid for, same goes for the keyboard. Keyboard is okay, Caps Lock doesn\u2019t light up or anything so it always keeps you guessing when entering passwords for online accounts. Who knew logging into websites could be a fun game! Nonetheless the keyboard feels cheap as to be expected. Picture quality is decent. If videos would load i\u2019m sure the laptop wouldn\u2019t be too bad for simple tasks, using word, very light internet surfing, staring at your 240 I mean 1080p background picture. Startup is slow, even after removing the bloatware, resetting windows, I can still cook myself dinner and by the time i\u2019ve finished I can finally log into my dinosaur er I mean laptop. I was going to install an SSD but alas I can\u2019t help but feel it would be a wasted effort. No point in putting a fresh heart into a dying body. Sound quality, I shouldn\u2019t even have to address this. Its a laptop, they shouldn\u2019t even come with internal speakers at this point. Buy an externet speaker set. I got an Amazon Basics set 4 or so years ago and they work pretty well. Not perfect, but a huge upgrade for $15. Overall feels worth it for ~$360 if you receive a working model. Acer needs to either up their QC or address some defects. Maybe the defective models simply get routed right back with the working ones and shipped out. Who knows.","My HP and DELL had a few bells and whistles that I miss on this ACER. Other than the aforementioned, for speed, functionality and price this laptop is excellent!","Very disappointed. So called high speed high power wi fi  is b.s.! Can't get online with enough speed to even update. Rubbish.","The first day I had this Acer E5-576-392H home, I noticed the battery level was at 85% (plugged in, charging). After lunch, it was still at 85%. The next morning, it was still at 85%. I disconnected the charging cord and the computer immediately died and wouldn't turn back on under battery power. The Acer customer service rep in the Dominican Republic said they'd give me a prepaid shipping label but it wasn't in the email he sent to me. I'm still waiting for Acer to email the return shipping label. Returning the computer on the third day is on their dime. EDIT: I just called again to Acer Support and again I received, \"This product hasn't been registered yet. After this call please go to support.acer.com...\" and then the call disconnects.","I have bought 2 laptops in the past 2 years from Acer.  They are the only Acer products I have ever bought, and they are the only ones I will ever buy.  The first was a Helios 300.  Though their service professionals are amiable enough their ability to help is hamstrung by Acer's policies.  The only recourse anyone ever has with their product is to ship it in to their repair centers where the the initial level of diagnostics is totally insufficient.  My first laptop had a motherboard problem but they sent it back to me without repair.  The problem persisted and they had to elevate my problem to someone who actually sounded like they knew anything about computers.  I finally got a usable computer a full month and half after I ordered which makes one ask if I should even both with Amazon's 2-day shipping.  The second laptop has a bad HDD.  I KNOW it's a bad HDD.  I've confirmed it in several different ways and just want to replace the HDD.  I'm overseas and sending it in will cost more than the laptop is worth, but does that matter?  Nope.  Will the service representative refer me to a supervisor?  Nope.  Their ONLY recourse they're allowed is send it in.  If you won't send it in, we won't do anything about the bad HDD we gave you.  If you get a functional laptop you probably will never have to deal with these folks, but I'm batting a 1000 on Acer products here with failed hardware shipped in them.  Either I'm extremely unlucky, or Acer's quality control is the worst I've ever seen.","Very easy to upgrade to make a very fast laptop. I used Macrium Reflect Free (easy to find on the net) to clone the slow HDD to a Adata SU800 M.2 2280 256GB SSD. I replaced the 6GB Ram provided (1x4GB + 1x2GB) with 2x4GB Crucial DDR3L 1600mhz Ram sticks. There are 3 screws on the bottom to remove to access both. A piece of cake. One note; when I first started the laptop back up after replacing the Ram, it wouldn't boot up. I then swapped the old Ram back in and it booted fine. I could not find an answer for this online so I just tried swapping the new Ram back in again. It worked this time! I held down the power button until it booted. Everthing is fine now. It boots up in about 5 sec. Also, when you boot it up for the first time after cloning the HDD, it will automatically boot to the SSD. To get into Bios just press F2 and hold as soon as you see the Acer logo when booting up. There is new Firmware for the Bios at the Acer website and also fixes for the Intel chip hacks (Specter and Meltdown). You should probably do these ASAP.","I hesitate to leave such a horrible review but it has been a 5 day nightmare for me and it does't seem to be over yet. The browser would close on its own and open a random window that I did not open. I heard myself talking through the laptop speakers and looked behind the window I had open and was staring back at myself because the computer had opened Skype all by itself. Suddenly, I couldn't open any items on the desktop. The cursor would move but clicking on items wouldn't open them. It wouldn't type into the search bar, and the Windows Icon (far bottom left) wouldn't open to allow me to reboot. I had to force reboot by holding the power button (which I hate to do). Then, the \"restarting\" wheel just swirled and swirled... When I tried to backup my files by plugging in my external hard drive, it recognized it okay and opened the window to show the files, while I was looking it, it suddenly closed that window and opened another window. Then, while transferring files from the laptop to the external drive, I started getting the message, \"Are you sure you want to save this file without its properties\"? WTH? Also, when I clicked the Windows Icon (lower left) that opens to show the programs in alphabetic order, suddenly before my eyes, all names and icons of the programs disappeared and a random alphabet appears... A B C D etc with no names or icons. But, when I clicked the Windows Icon again, it all came back. It literally felt like there was a ghost in the laptop or someone was controlling it from elsewhere. I  have been on the phone with Amazon, Acer, and even Microsoft Windows.  I had already spent two days re-installing all my files and software (winzip, video editing software, Microsoft Word, Norton) only to ultimately restore Windows to factory settings while on the phone with Microsoft. This is when the problem occurred while trying to backup my files to the external drive... which caused me to fear that my external device was now corrupted. That device held 8 years of research with documents and images I had created. It held the backup of 4 books I had written, the family tree book I had been working on since 2012, and all our ancestors photos I had restores and only I had this family data. I had my wedding photos and photos of my deceased mother who just passed and my deceased brother who died in 1976 in a car accident, my daughter's baby pictures... So, I was horrified when I plugged the drive in after the factory restore and got the message that the external drive was not recognized. Thankfully! Thankfully! My brother helped me retrieve my data from it. I had bought my husband the exact same laptop but from another vendor and his didn't have these problems. The seal on my laptop had not been broken but Amazon customer service had said, \"So, you bought this on Nov 14th\". No... I bought it on Nov 29th. Then she said, \"No problem, I'll just change that for you\". Which makes me wonder what happened between Nov 14th and the 29th? A fluke? Last night around 1am, my Kindle starts alerting me of Yahoo email login failures and something about failures to log into Amazon through my Yahoo email. This is a full 5 days after this all started. So, at 2 am I up changing all my passwords to every account I own; my bank, Paypal, Amazon, Yahoo email... etc'.  I have demanded that Acer investigate by tracing the laptop though its SN number but am told they can't do that. It is their responsibility to ensure that their customer receive a clean computer. I have been emotionally exhausted, emotionally distraught, mentally exhausted and physically exhausted and I shouldn't have had to go through this. Customers should't have to restore their laptop Windows back to factory settings. But, my husband's laptop was fine. Somebody, somewhere, did something to the laptop I received and I feel it should be investigated. Maybe this feedback will make that happen. Or, maybe they will just come after me instead. That would be a lot easier than tracing where their corrupted laptop came from.","The computer is extremely slow. Much of what needs to be done takes quite some time or doesn't happen at all. Installing simple software is a pain. I returned the item immediately as soon as I dug into it.","USB 3.0, USB-C, 1080 screen, 1TB HDD, no sacrifice in CPU age\/gen (8th gen i3) and no hot & hungry AMD. I shopped Walmart, Best Buy, Target, Amazon and eBay. Over several weeks many deals came and went but this was still a better deal for what it has. No need for a giant battery, though at 20% brightness I'm still nowhere near the 12hr battery life. Maybe closer to 8 hrs, after streaming video (not only streaming video but casting to the TV too). All in all, you don't need a bigger name brand with a bigger price tag, they all use the same companies for each component and Acer isn't going to be any less quality than Samsung Dell or HP. At least it's not a garbage Chromebook for the sub 400 pricetag either.  Very happy with this after a few days. Just be sure to uninstall any and all bloatware from Acer, for the love of God remove Norton (go Bitdefender Free) and you'll have much better performance!!!","Writing this review on this machine. I needed a machine that would allow me to work with my personal photos, music files and of coarse the internet. I don't venture into gaming so I didn't need a processor that could outrun the speed of light and I'm not a DJ or professional photographer. So this machine is much better than what I had. My only dislike is the way Microsoft tries to tell you how and what you will run on Windows10 rather than letting the user make that choice. Otherwise great battery life and fast charging. Very quick boot up and shut down. And the size to weight ratio is even better than I thought.","Very nice laptop PC for the price, though the screen could be brighter and the viewing angle wider, and there will those those who complain that the keyboard isn't back-lit and that there's no Nvidia gaming video adapter. What do you want for $329? I've swapped out the 1TB hard drive for a $70 Crucial 500GB NVMe PCIe SSD  (https:\/\/smile.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B07J2WBKXF\/( and swapped out the 6GB of memory it came with for a  $68 16GB (2 8GB-SODIMMs) kit from Samsung (https:\/\/smile.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00KEAEX54\/) . With these added-on bits, performance is far faster than most \"ordinary folks\" will need anytime soon. (I'm a former computer network engineer, and I've very happy with it.) There are several videos on YouTube showing how easy it is to do both of these parts swaps: remove 3 screws and cover plate (carefully!), remove m.2 hold-down screw, insert NVMe PCIe drive, reinsert and gently(!) tighten m.2 hold-down screw, remove and replace memory SODIMMs, replace cover plate and 3 screws = Done! Attached is a 15-second video showing Windows 10  booting to a log-in screen in about 8 seconds, at least half of which time is spent bootstrap loading the Acer bios. The included Acronis True-Image software worked fine in transferring the OEM Windows image to the SSD. After the transfer completed successfully, I did a \"Fresh Start\" to get a perfectly clean Windows install without any of the useless  trial software which Acer is famous for burdening its laptops (and their users) with. Had I a chance to do things over, I'd spend the extra few dollars and get the $104 1TB version of the Crucial SSD (https:\/\/smile.amazon.com\/Crucial-1TB-NAND-NVMe-PCIe\/dp\/B07J2Q4SWZ\/), which offers much higher data transfer speeds, although the performance difference is really only noticeable when moving very large files about. See PCWorld's comparative review at www[.]pcworld[.]com\/article\/3337244\/crucial-p1-nvme-ssd-review.html. There is a second comparative review at www[.]pcper[.]com\/reviews\/Storage\/Crucial-P1-500GB-and-1TB-M2-NVMe-SSD-Review-More-QLC . FWIW I was also able to use EaseUS Todo PCTrans to then migrate most of my applications and files from my old laptop to this new one. A few licensed apps needed to be reinstalled with new activation keys, but most worked right away without any issues. I used a 1TB USB drive to effect this transfer as moving this much data via my (very fast--I am a former computer network engineer!) home WiFi network would have taken 12 hours or more. I  took two stabs at it; on the first try, I tried to tell PCTrans exactly what to move, without a particularly good result. On the second, I just let it do what it wanted to do and all was good. BTW I used Macrium Reflect (free version) to capture a backup image of the original 1TB factory hard drive before making any software modifications, and to capture an additional backup image of the SSD after each significant modification had been made. Doing so gave me the option to undo any modification step that that might happen to go awry. I plan to reinstall and reformat the 1TB drive and use it going forward as a convenient repository for automated daily system backups made using Macrium Reflect. Hope this helps a few folks! If it does, please leave  a comment on this review, so I'll know that it did. Thanks!","I was looking to upgrade my old Acer Aspire, and I chose this model as a good budget option for basic home productivity use.  Looking at the specifications for the computer, the components that I most wanted to change were the mechanical hard drive and the mismatched pair of DIMMs that will prevent operating in dual-channel mode.  Fortunately, the laptop is designed to make both of those components easily replaceable. I replaced the HDD with an SSD and upgraded the RAM to an 8GB dual-channel kit.  Before swapping out the HDD, I went into the BIOS, added a password, and disabled secure boot.  I'm not sure if the password was necessary, but my last Acer laptop would lock out the HDD after a change unless the BIOS password was set, so I set the password on this one as well.  The upgrade process was quick and easy thanks to the access panel in the back of the laptop.  The SDD from the old laptop had an installation of Ubuntu 16.04 with the HWE stack, and everything worked well without making any new changes to the OS (I did have the minor workaround of changing the line \"GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT = \u201cquiet splash\u201d\"  to \"GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT = \u201cquiet splash acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor\u201d\" in \/etc\/default\/grub already setup on my old laptop, so that may still be necessary for a new install).  After the upgrades, the laptop seems very responsive to me.  Of course, Ubuntu on an SSD is a very different setup from the laptop as shipped, so I really can't say what the user experience of Windows 10 on the HDD would be like. As others have commented, the screen is not the best, but it is good enough if you're not doing graphic design or gaming.  Also, I don't understand the fuss about the lack of a backlit keyboard, as I don't look at the keyboard while I type anyway.","Okay, I am definitely not a typical user.  I got this because it had excellent reviews and everyone said it was a fantastic deal hardware vs value.  (I purchased it at $324, although I missed the $315 price which was only there for less than a day) Everyone also mentioned that it only started feeling peppy after the mechanical HDD was replaced by an SSD. I can only blame the available holiday sales because my first choice was to upgrade the SSD to an M.2 NVMe 500GB drive.  To those who asked, yes, it can indeed run an NVMe drive.  I am pretty sure the bus can't handle a full speed one so I purchased a cheap one that had merely 2000MB\/s Read and 1750 MB\/s for 89.99.  Yes, it works and it works great! https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B07J2WBKXF\/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Then I saw another sale of a normal 2.5\" SSD.  A 1TB SSD.  I have a small Diskstation from Synology so it was easy to convince myself that I could replace the existing 2.5\" drive.  I can always use the extra drives.  $127.98.  You could easily get this instead of the M.2 one above and from what most people say, you wouldn't notice the difference. https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B078DPCY3T\/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Then, of course, it was noted that since the RAM chips are different sizes it is only operating in single channel mode instead of dual channel mode.  Well off to e-bay to get 16GB of memory.  56 dollars.  No link since it was used, not a store sale. It presently has KINGSTON  PC3L-12800S, 1600MHz, 204 pin, 11-11-C3 2GB+4GB SODIMM. Then I noted that the external mouse I used had an annoying nub sticking out from the mouse receiver.  Okay, off to get a bluetooth mouse.  The one I got has dual modes that can work with my work laptop too. $13.99. https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B07CH1ZZFP\/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Now this version of the laptop does not have a backlit keyboard.  My eyes are getting weak in my old age so I wondered if you could replace the keyboard with a backlit version.  After some research, I found you could, but it required soldering some components to the board.  While I am an electrical engineer it looked a bit riskier than I was comfortable with, so I went with the next best thing.  Fluorescent keyboard stickers.  They work pretty darn well.  Very visible and although it took some getting used to, not THAT ugly. $9.96. https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B004CJPS66\/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 One of the reasons I bought the laptop was it had a DVD.  I have movies and when I go on vacation or even a business trip I may bring one along.  I can use an external case but I like all in one solution.  The issue?  It's a DVD.  All my newer videos are blueray.  Fortunately, the drive is easy to take out.  Be careful.  The tabs for the bezel are fragile and the cheapest replacement bezel is about $15 and it's still unclear if it has the right form factor.  One of the reasons I got this is that I have extra slim external blueray drives.  I had intended to cannibalize one and stick it in my new laptop.  The problem was that the drive slot is for a 9mm high DVD.  Mine were 12mm high.  Whoops, that wasn't in the specs.  To be honest I didn't even know they came in 9mm size.  Well off to E-bay to get a 9mm blueray.  $45 not including shipping. Link removed since only amazon links are allowed whoops! UJ273, SATA-9mm, Blu-ray-dvd-burner-rewritable-BD-RW-drive Then I started to really notice a drawback to the laptop.  The LCD panel.  At any angle except straight on it was washed out and faded.  Even looking straight on video was... pretty terrible.  Okay, research mode.  Can I upgrade to an IPS screen and get a touchscreen?  No.  Apparently, a digitizer needs to be built into the motherboard (maybe a future upgrade;) in order to use a touchscreen.  An IPS screen replacement was cheap and after looking over Youtube DIY videos, its actually really easy upgrade.  A previous reviewer even supplied a model number and since then an Amazon seller was supplying them pretty cheap.  The increase in usability was breathtaking.  I regret nothing. $37.00. https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00JMM89NC\/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 My final upgrade came about noting how annoying to was to type in my password every time it woke up from sleep mode.  An extra ten to twenty seconds!  Intolerable!  Off to get a fingerprint reader to enable Windows Hello. Logging in with a finger swipe.  Of course, now I got a USB Dongle thingie again.  Hmm. Two steps forward, one step back.  Cheap but it took two weeks to ship despite being marked Prime. $21.99 https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B073Z6NZCJ\/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Okay, most people aren't going to be doing all of that.  It was more of a hobby than any real need.  Frankly, the only thing that was necessary was the SSD replacement.  I am hoping to recoup some of the cost by reselling the parts I removed on e-bay. I have a full-fledged gaming rig but I haven't played games in a while so I temporarily retired it in order to put the laptop through normal use for a while.  I connected the VGA port and the HDMI to a 4k monitor.  In general, it was extremely usable.  RAM use is consistently at 7 GB.  If I had only 8GB I don't know if I would be experiencing slowdowns (generally RAM is not 100% usable by programs). For business use, I usually have two Word documents up and referenced.  For shorter documents, I may not notice lag but my documents are over 300 pages (I am a writer as a hobby).  In documents this large there is a bit of spikey lag.  I suppose as it saves in the background and scrolls to the next bit to be viewed.  It's not horrible but definitely there. Internet browsing is seamless.  I have 6-8 tabs open and there is no delay in switching.  Youtube IT reviews and DIY videos are excellent experiences, especially with the new screen. As for gaming... I haven't played much in a while but after I did all that work so I wanted to see if I could do anything with the Intel 620 graphics.  I booted up Diablo 3.  Settings on full.  Wow, no stuttering, beautiful experience.  I put it the big 4k screen and notice its suddenly running in a window.  Full stop!  Horrible from rate!  Ugh.  Change it back to Fullscreen 1080 and suddenly its butter smooth!  An old game but still delightful.  More importantly its delightful on this laptop. Next, I load Fallout 76.  Yes.  I bought it.  Yes.  I regret it.  It loads up fine but the character creation is hideously painful.  Not because of the of the graphics but because there is a huge cursor lag of 5 seconds. Odd.  I start up the game on minimum settings.  It does load, it does have horrible framerates that I don't think I could bear (if I could bear the actual game) but it runs.  At low settings, it ugly as sin and moving feels like your constantly encumbered but it does run. Now when I installed the SSD I did a fresh install, so I didn't notice the bloatware mentioned by other people.  I installed it in a UEFI format... which was surprisingly tricky while using a USB install stick.  Supposedly this format will boot faster.  I have noticed that it doesn't always come up from sleep mode gracefully and I have to reboot it.  I fiddled with the power settings and now it comes up from sleep mode reliably and doesn't ignore the keyboard and mouse (Bios setting plus power setting).  I am presently worrying whether it will go to sleep reliably since I had to disable sleep on the closing lid.  Also, the fingerprint sensing on logging in from waking on sleep seems to have issues sensing fingerprints at first.  Logging in with password and then logging in and out makes the fingerprint sensor work... but this defeats the purpose of a fingerprint sensor if I can't figure out to make it work reliably upon waking.","For the price, it's a great college laptop. Student programs like Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, Mail all run without issue thanks to the 8th gen Intel CPU. It delivered snappy desktop performance (when I changed the HDD) and has up-to-date ports (like the USB-C port). If I could recommend one thing, it would be to change the HDD to an SSD. Then, you would get rid of the bottleneck that is the cheap accompanied hard disk drive. Not only was it slow and choppy, it was also making louder-than-normal reading noise. Replacing it to a 240GB SSD solved all my problems. When buying this laptop you need to promise yourself to not play any intensive games. It doesn't have an integrated GPU. I learned this the hard way. But it's fine since I already own a gaming PC, and it's a good thing too since I won't play games while in the university library instead of studying like I should be :)  The trackpad is sort of sticky and doesn't have a slippy film that helps with finger movement. With higher temperatures and sweatier fingers, it can be a little annoying. A cheap wireless mouse, however, remedies this.  The screen has severe light bleed but I didn't expect any better. It hurts my eyes in my dark room but in the uni library it doesn't make a difference For my use case: 8\/10. It lost a few points since I had to buy a 50$ SSD to replace the slow HDD. However, I love it in every other aspect: I don't need an integrated GPU, and it sells for a great price for college students. Go for it if you only intend to study\/send emails\/browse the web. Remember, it NEEDS an SSD, or at least a faster HDD.","bought 11-24-2018 I give this laptop a 5 star rating for the price I paid.  $320.00 The 5400 rpm hard drive is the slow boat from China.  Holy cow.  The slow boat...  Other than that, there is no reason (yet) to not buy this.  I unplugged at 9am as and went until 2:30pm and was at 26% battery.  I rendered 1080p video between 28 and 35 fps with handbrake.  I played half life 2 from 70 to 120 fps...  I wouldn't try battle field V lol.  The body is flexible because it's plastic, so don't pick it up and expect it to hold without bending like an iPad.  It will flex. Like my title says.  Definitely a buy, if you aren't picky with budget laptops. I see complaints about the monitor...  Ya.  Don't spend less than $400 and gripe.  For less than $400, I'm fine with the monitor.  CPU intensive tasks Max it out.  Oh well.  It is an energy efficient dual core. I am happy that I bought it. update on laptop.  Today is January 16th, 2019 and I was so unsatisfied with the slow boat from china hard drive that I upgraded to an M.2 1TB SSD.  Holy cow. Laptop $320 (black Friday price) Samsung m.2 1TB SSD $100 Total price: $420 An m.2 SSD upgrade is THE WAY TO GO! This 8th gen i3 suddenly came alive when it wasn't waiting for the slow boat from china HD. My review still stands concerning screen quality.  Sure, the contrast is lacking.  Look at the price.  Don't gripe.  The body is plastic, it does  flex.  Don't stress it.  I'd still buy it and upgrade it again.","This Acer Aspire E 15, 15.6\" Full HD, 8th Gen Intel Core i3-8130U, 6GB RAM Memory, 1TB HDD, 8X DVD, E5-576-392H was purchased for my wife to use.  She doesn\u2019t do video games or anything in any way computationally intensive.  At the time of purchase (April 2019), the price was $329.  I read a lot of the reviews and appreciated all the helpful information.  People were recommending installing a solid state drive (SSD) to reduce boot time and increasing the memory (RAM) size to allow the computer to operate faster.  I decided in advance of ordering this computer to do both of those things. I hope this review will be useful and maybe address some of the difficulties reported by others. After receiving the computer and going through Windows setup, everything seemed to be working ok.  It was extremely difficult to insert USB devices into the ports the first time.  It took so much force, I was afraid something would break.  That improved with continued use.  I bought some USB flash memory sticks and created a Windows 10 Recovery USB drive.  (SanDisk Cruzer CZ36 32GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive, Frustration-Free Packaging- SDCZ36-032G-AFFP for $6.99 each). Some reviewers said they were not able to get into the BIOS, but I had no problem getting into BIOS by tapping the F2 key during boot-up. At least one reviewer said wifi performance was poor and replaced the wifi card.  I did not have that problem, wifi reception was excellent, never dropped out, was ok waking from sleep. I had no wifi problems at all. On the Acer website, I selected Support then chose Drivers and Manuals from that dropdown menu.  I entered model E5-576-392H but that didn\u2019t work.  I found the SNID number on the label on the bottom of the computer and entered that, which took me to a list of the things available to download.  I downloaded the User Manual PDF files.  I did not download and install any device drivers or BIOS revision.  One reviewer cautioned against installing the BIOS revision, so that made me cautious.  On the web I found and downloaded a free DVD player program (VLC) and played part of a movie DVD to verify DVD operation.  I downloaded Adobe Reader, PrimoPDF, and some other utility programs that I like.  I signed my wife up for Microsoft Office 365 personal and downloaded those programs.  (I have been a ribbon hater, but decided to finally master that and quit complaining\u2026ordered latest copies of Word and Exel Bible \u2013 used from Amazon.) After a few days of operating and testing, a memory upgrade was ordered.  This computer came with one 2GB and one 4GB memory sticks as other reviewers have described.  Some just bought a single 4 GB for a very low price to replace the 2 GB, but I decided to buy a 16 GB kit (two 8GB) of a brand I was familiar with for $87.98 (Crucial 16GB Kit (8GBx2) DDR3\/DDR3L 1600 MT\/S (PC3-12800) Unbuffered SODIMM 204-Pin Memory - CT2KIT102464BF160B).  That was easy to install and operated ok.  There was a YouTube video of how to do the install. After I installed the memory upgrade but before I ordered the SSD, I wanted to run a free memory test program (MemTest86).  That required making a USB flash memory drive with the MemTest86 program on it and booting from it.  I could see the USB drive in the BIOS and move it to the top of the boot order, but I could not get the computer to actually boot from it.  And when I went back into the BIOS, it showed the boot order change had not been preserved.  This not being able to successfully change the boot order was a worry.  More about that, and how it turned out, later. Reviewers were saying conflicting things about installing an SSD.  Some reviewers replaced the HDD with an equivalent SATA SSD.  Some reviewers said that a new M.2 type SSD could not coexist with the HDD that came installed in the computer.  One reviewer claimed to have confirmed this with Acer tech support!!  I found a YouTube video that seemed to contradict that and at least one reviewer said they had both drives operating simultaneously.  I wanted to install an M.2 style SSD, which I had no previous experience with, and hoped I could use it for boot drive C and keep the 1TB mechanical drive as drive E for additional storage (the DVD drive is drive D).  At that point in time, I didn\u2019t know if that plan would work out or not. From the reviews and Wikipedia, it seemed there are at least two types of M.2 style SSDs, one type with a SATA interface, the other type with an NVMe interface which is faster and also more expensive.  One reviewer said, yes the NVMe interface is faster, but you will never see the difference unless you are doing something very heavy duty computationally.  That had the ring of truth to it, so I bought Crucial MX500 500GB 3D NAND SATA M.2 Type 2280SS Internal SSD - CT500MX500SSD4 for $66.99.  The connecter end of this M.2 SSD circuit board had two little cutouts, with a few connectors on left and right, and a wide section in the middle. The socket in the computer had only one interference nib. Temporary major panic quandary, which side of the M.2 SSD should be up!!  Then I realized the small sections on each side of the SSD were not the exact same width, so it would actually insert only one way. Whew.  When I powered up the computer, the new drive did not show up in the BIOS, but I clicked on the Windows button and in the pop-up menu I scrolled down to Windows Administrative Tools, selected Computer Management, then selected Disk Management and it was there as uninitialized disk 2. I didn\u2019t do anything more at this point. The YoutTube video I found for my exact computer (title \u201cHow to clone Acer Aspire E5 576 392H HDD to SSD make boot drive without reinstalling Windows 10\u201d) used a program EaseUS Todo.  Unfortunately, the free version of that program did not have the cloning feature.  I would have to buy the program to get that feature.  I found another YouTube video for a Dell laptop (title \u201cHow to Clone Windows from a Hard Disk to an M.2 SSD (and Keep It Bootable)\u201d).  It was beautifully made and used a slick free program Macrium Reflect, and when it was done it booted from the new SSD and the HDD had a different drive letter.  In the container with my Crucial M.2 SSD was a little paper that said go to the Crucial website\/clone and get a download there. That was Acronis TrueImage which is a program I am familiar with and has been around for years. I installed Acronis and followed the prompts using automatic mode.  When it finished, there was no second drive showing in File Explorer.  Repeating the steps above to get back to the Disk Management window, the SSD was there and formatted. but had not been assigned a drive letter.  I thought about doing something there, but did not.  I decided to shut down the computer and take out the HDD, then reboot to see if it would boot off the M.2 SSD. After removing the bottom cover, it was not obvious to me how to remove the HDD.  I found another YouTube video title \u201cAcer Install a Hard Drive and Do a Fresh Install of Windows 10\u201d that showed I could just slide the HDD out, which I did.  Then when I booted into the BIOS, the Information page showed no HDD0, and the SSD showed as HDD1.  On the Boot page, Windows Boot Manager was showing the model number for the HDD1. The boot time into Windows was much faster.  All the programs were there and worked, so the clone was successful.  In Windows Disk Management, the new SSD showed as drive C. The question was, when the 1TB HDD was put back into the computer, how to achieve the computer seeing the new SSD as boot drive C and the old HDD as drive E?  What determined which drive it would boot from, was it the BIOS?  I put the old HDD back in.  When I powered up the computer, I was slow to hit F2, so I missed getting into the BIOS.  However, Windows booted fast to my surprise.  I got into Disk Management, and lo and behold there was the new 500GB SSD as drive C and the old 1TB HDD as drive E.  I didn\u2019t have to do a darn thing.  Windows and the BIOS figured it out by themselves.  Windows File Explorer showed both drives. I powered down and back up a few times, always with the same good result.  So I don\u2019t know why some reviewers had a problem with having both drives in. Very happy with this purchase.","As of September 3rd 2018, the e5-576-392H tech details on the amazon web page states that the laptop has three (3) USB3 ports however it only has two. The ACER web page for this product has the correct information. I would advise the buyer to review the ACER web page before purchase. I did flag amazon on this point. The paperwork for the computer that came enclosed did not provide information on how to charge the battery for the first time. I did find my answers on the ACER web page which does a fine job of explaining it. These are not links but can be used as search parameters. I used them as search paramers with google. ACER - Preparing the Battery for First Time Use ACER - How to charge and care for your Acer battery ACER - How does the battery indicator light on my Acer Aspire notebook work Please note that my review is not for the product performance. So far (after two days) I have not been disappointed. I should also note that I have not yet completed the three required battery charge\/discharge processes (24 hour charge then full battery discharge). Edit 9\/13\/19: I added an SSD and more memory to my computer and have found that the battery draw is significantly higher and as such the battery does not last as long. I am told that trading out the screen for a brighter one will also increase power draw. This is not  an issue for me since it remains plugged in 99% of the time I use it. However it may affect users who want to use this computer unplugged. After a year of use it is running exceptionally well with no battery failures.","Definitely worth the buy! Great laptop for the money . Works great!","Good product. I3-8130u. Replaced the full HD 1080p TN screen with Full HD 1080p IPS screen & it makes a huge difference. Its only $40 on ebay for B156HAN01.2 for IPS screen. Totally recommend changing ur screen as soon as u can. Very easy to do. 6 gb ram is what makes it a bit slow. Replaced 2gb with 4gb stick & now i have 4gb+ 4gb & it became very snappy. Going to add M.2 ssd soon & it should work even better. UHD 620 can run many games & if u have minimum 8gb or more then u can increase the dedicated gpu memory & gain 10-20 fps in some games. Google how to do it. Totally works. Audio is also good. Usb 3.1 type c is not thunderbolt in case anyone is wondering. So u have 3 options for upgrade. $40 ram, $40 m.2 ssd (minimum), $ 40 screen. For dedicated gpu ram - 128 mb is default. 256- is what i use now & its a sweet spot without losing cpu performance.(30fps in fallout 4, 50+ in MW2, 70-80 in CSS) 512 mb is little better but u notice computer slowing down for normal tasks. Not good for 6 gb ram. Might work on 8 gb. PIC: Orginal TN panel vs New IPS panel(came with 1 dead pixel which is hardly noticeable) Going to try installing eGpu. Will update if I ever do it","I bought this to replace a 12 year old Lenovo ThinkPad that was still kicking but starting to slow down. Some of the main things I was looking for with a new laptop was a 1080p display, an optical drive, the ability to install an SSD, and a decent processor, all for about $300. The first thing I did with this laptop was replace the 1TB HDD with a 250GB Samsung SSD, which was quite easy. It took me a bit to realize the drive needed to slide horizontally to be unplugged before being lifted out (duh). I may increase the RAM in the future, but for the time being, 6GB is sufficient. Overall I'm quite pleased with this laptop. It's working well as a light-duty computer for browsing the internet, streaming movies, and doing some light processing when I'm not at my main workstation. It boots quickly and generally works as expected. The build quality is not the same as the ThinkPad, but I wasn't expecting that since the ThinkPad was a top-end model in it's day and was quite solidly built. Overall I'm happy with the laptop as it does all I expected it to do and has an excellent battery life.","UPDATE 7\/14\/2019: I got this laptop in October and have had enough issues with it that I thought I would update my review. Primarily, the main problem is that the quick start process -- which actually begins when you shut down the laptop after your prior use -- can cause the laptop to hang when shutting down.  I had to disable the quick start options and just use the regular shut down and start up, which makes the start up process nearly five minutes long. It's 1 1\/2 minutes from power on to the point you put in your PIN, then another 2 1\/2 minutes before the Windows Defender Security Center turns from the red exclamation mark to the green all clear (or sometimes yellow warning triangle, more on that later). You need Defender to say everything is ready before you can get online, otherwise your browsers and apps will just hang until it's decided your antivirus and firewall are working. That leads to the second big problem: Norton. Norton is the only antivirus I could find that worked with this laptop, the other programs I tried simply didn't register with Defender and it would constantly tell me I had no firewall or no antivirus. Norton isn't that pricey so I just went with it, but it takes so long to start up that it adds another 1 1\/2 to 2 minutes onto start-up time because your browser can't work until the Norton icon in the task bar has a green checkmark showing all clear. Windows Defender, meanwhile, has some kind of bug where it tells me there's a warning and I get the yellow warning triangle, but when I go to see the warning, there's nothing there. Also, as I mentioned in my original review, the sleep functions simply lock up the computer too often to use. I had to disable them completely, which reduces battery life. I use a screen saver so I won't get burn-in or anything, but it would have been nice if I'd been able to let the laptop idle or sleep when not in use. Instead, I have to turn it on or off, or let it idle as the battery drains. For this price the machine really should be better than it is. It's okay for watching movies, email and social media, and once the laptop is actually up and running after the lengthy startup it's okay, but the amount of work I had to go through to keep it from washing out the image (see below in my original review) and locking up is unreasonable. ORIGINAL REVIEW: This laptop has been pretty glitchy for me in terms of locking up when it goes to sleep, and in not keeping the color and brightness settings consistently. I was going to return the laptop at first but after reading reviews and playing with some settings decided to keep this, as this was mostly meant to be a portable web browser and DVD player for me to use in the bedroom. If I needed it for anything heavier than that, I would have sent it back. The longer story: One of the very first things that happened on this laptop was that the screen just went blank for no reason. It happened twice, the first time when I closed the lid briefly during the setup process, the second time after I let the laptop sit and idle until sleep kicked in, at which point I couldn't wake the screen up. The only solution was to hold down the power button for about 15 seconds and restart, which caused instability on the machine when I turned it back on. A search shows that this laptop has that problem a lot. There are several solutions to this problem and I wanted to share what worked for me. First, I make sure neither the screen nor the laptop goes into sleep mode by setting all the power settings to Never, and go out to Additional Power Settings and put them on Never, too. Then change the option for closing the lid to Do Nothing on all drop down menus. That doesn't actually fix all of the problems (and of course it uses battery, because it never goes idle) but it helps a lot. Still, closing the laptop lid, even though it's supposed to \"do nothing,\" causes the laptop to lock up. Nothing has fixed that problem for me so far. There was also a big problem with the laptop not shutting off when I turn it off. It goes into sleep and the power light and fan stay on, and it can't be turned off unless you hold down the power button. I had to do that that about 25% of the time, but eventually found that turning off the fast startup option solved it. The laptop doesn't boot as fast BUT you don't have to force the laptop to shut down by holding the power button down, which to me is worth it. Also, one solution for the laptop getting stuck in idle is to dial back the graphics driver to a previous version, which I did -- on this laptop, that previous version is a 2006 driver, but so far it's been okay and hasn't given me any trouble. Because of the locking up during the setup process when I first got the laptop, the unit was very unstable. You couldn't change volume, some apps wouldn't open, etc. A reinstall of Windows 10 fixed that -- with all the sleep options turned off during that reinstall, of course, so it didn't go to sleep or into hibernation while reinstalling -- but I do still get times when the brightness and color on my display settings won't stick. It happens off and on, and always on bootup if it DOES happen -- the laptop will boot up and after all icons load on the task bar, it brightens up by a noticeable amount. The color is very washed out even after a lot of tweaking, and I'm going to have to do more work to try to figure that particular problem out. After two tries because the laptop was locking up, the setup process finally worked, but the process was clumsy and irritating, partly because the scroll didn't work on setup, partly because a lot of the things you have to input just simply didn't take. During setup, Microsoft wanted to verify my identity so they sent a code to my phone number, but the code that I was sent didn't work. I clicked the option to send a second code and it didn't go through, locking up the entire process. I went back about 10 screens and started again and this time it worked. However, the setup process was an enormous waste of time. Note that during setup, you have to click to read both the privacy statement and the terms before it'll let you click next. It was easy enough to make changes to the privacy settings once the laptop was finally up and working. There are several good articles out there (I recommend \"How to reclaim your privacy in Windows 10\" on PC World, but there are tons of others) and getting to the settings is pretty easy with Cortana's ask me anything bar. I have Cortana turned off as much as possible, but find the search bar very handy. DVD playback is very nice. I use VLC free download to play movies with good results. Sound from the speakers isn't great, it can be pretty tinny, but with bluetooth headphones it sounds really good. Battery life is good -- I haven't gotten 12 hours, but can go seven with nearly constant use. I installed Mozilla Firefox and it's working well, no problems so far. Sometimes Edge wants to come up as a browser when I do a search for something on the Cortana search bar, even though Firefox is supposed to be my default, but that's not a dealbreaker for me. Overall, the laptop is nice enough. The occasional lockup is giving me an ulcer, but when I look at reviews and comments for other laptops at a slightly higher price point, I figure this is the best laptop I'm going to get for a low price. If you're looking for something for school or work or more heavy duty usage, I would go with a better quality laptop, however.  I may have decided to keep this unit, but I wouldn't trust it for anything really important.","Summary: If you stick to the default configuration - 6GB RAM, 1TB spinning drive - you are likely to get frustrated with this laptop (2.5-3 stars). It can be very responsive at times, but for the first several minutes after every boot it is painfully slow, with the hard drive pegged at 100% usage. Replacing the hard drive with an SSD or M.2 SSD will make it feel like a completely different laptop (4+ stars), with few of the bottlenecks. As long as you're not gaming heavily or editing video, it's a solid performer - on par with my aging Core i7-3770 desktop. Details: My E15 arrived the night we left on vacation, so I didn't have time to upgrade the hardware; we spent a week with its default spinning (5400rpm) drive and 6GB RAM. After years of relying on SSD drives, returning to a spinning hard drive was painful. Every restart meant 5+ minutes of 100% hard drive activity and the system effectively unusable. After the drive activity caught up, the laptop could feel pretty peppy at times, but involve the hard drive again and it's back to seconds-to-minutes of paralysis.  The first couple of days were the worst, as the months of Windows and application updates worked to catch up. As soon as we returned home, I ordered an M.2 2280 SATA (WD Blue 500GB) for same-day delivery, along with a 16GB RAM upgrade kit (Crucial DDR3L-1600 2x8GB). I'd saved about $150 on he original purchase with gift cards and credit rewards points, so my personal cost of the laptop plus upgrades was still under $400. Replacing the RAM took less than a minute. The M.2 was a bit trickier to screw into place - tiny screw, fat fingers, older eyes - but once it was secured the fresh Windows install went smoothly with a bootable Windows 10 USB. (Tip: you will need to change the BIOS boot to Legacy mode and remove the existing drive, and you'll want to change the boot order so the SSD is at or near the top.) Note that if you have an old 2.5\" SSD lying around, chances are it will also work as a replacement. I tried with an old 120GB drive I pulled out of a desktop machine and it booted almost instantly; it just needed to install missing drivers and OS updates. The M.2 is likely going to be a bit faster, but not that much--and it's hard to beat free. You would need to activate with a different windows key, though, where on the fresh install it was activated for me. Once Windows was installed on the SSD, the machine powers up or restarts to a Ready state in seconds rather than minutes. Apps load quickly and some near-instantaneously; lag is minimal for most productivity apps. Pros: Disk and RAM are a quick and easy upgraded for a much better experience. USB-C is a nice addition; can recharge a USB-C phone  on battery or plugged in. Keyboard is decent to type on. 1080p screen. Speakers are loud. 802.11ac networking. DVD player. Cons: Poor performance with default spinning drive. Lots of bloatware. Webcam not that great. Screen has a narrow ideal range; veer too far from front-and-center and quality plummets. No backlit keyboard or cues when numlock, capslock, and scrolllock are active. Heavy. Plastic feels lower quality and attracts fingerprint smudges, though the design is attractive. Won't keep up with modern games. Power brick is ungainly.","1, love it. 2, love the price 3, YOU MUST MOD IT TO REALLY SEE HOW GOOD THIS CAN BE. 4, i added a 128gb m2 ssd, and 8gb ram stick, used the 1tb drive as storage. Reloaded Win10 and it self installed the key, it is soo fast, boot to password screen time 5 seconds. Once you put in password it is ready for work immediately!!! Adding the parts was easy. You might not want to do the bios updates. I did...had to use legacy mode to see my drives...not sure what that is about...but curiosity got the best of me. Best to not fix it, if it ain't broke. All in all, i got $370.00 on it and it acts like a BIG DOG!!!","Fantastic laptop! Runs most games i've thrown at it and it's easily upgradeable. I'm installing an SSD and running windows and apps off of it and using the included 1TB HDD as storage until i can get an SSD for storage as well. The battery life is excellent and it was almost entirely clear from the random crap most big box retailers slam into their off the shelf machines (removed the antivirus included as it doesn't hold a candle to avast). My major complaint thought is the trackpad. I really wish there were buttons on it instead of a click of the right or left side of the pad. I just can't get used to the tactile click vs having no button. I also have an issue with the power button essentially doing nothing. I wanted it to put the laptop to sleep but it doesn't do anything. Might be a software issue though.","I read and read and read all the reviews, both negative and positive.  Decided to take a chance and so glad I did!  This is a great laptop, so much faster than my old one!  I got the  HDD, and it's plenty fast enough for my needs.  Setup was easy, getting everything the way I like it was easy too.  It did a lot of Windows Updates automatically, so that was good.  I definitely recommend the Acer Aspire Laptop! UPDATE:  I just don't understand all the one-star reviews!  I absolutely love this laptop!  The complaints about it being slow are ridiculous!  I timed it and it boots up to the login page in TWENTY-EIGHT SECONDS!!!  How can anyone complain about that!  All the pages load quickly and it's worked perfectly since I've had it.  I just don't understand the complaints -- are they from real purchasers?  I wonder!  Well I am a real purchaser and I love it!","This Laptop is great. The sound and picture is sharp and the speed and ease of used has been quite surprising. I am not a gamer...just a regular Senior that needed a new and easy to use Laptop after my older Acer computer went Kaput! I am so happy to have found this Laptop...and the price was amazing!!! Best Christmas gift , ever! I have owned 2 other Acer computers and I have to say this one is the best one yet ! The improved speakers and the improved pleasure in watching movies and other videos is a great upgrade. Now I can watch my cat videos without them hanging up....LOLOLOL.....This is a great buy for anyone looking for a good all around laptop and Windows 10 was already installed and updated. I was afraid of Windows 10 but this laptop had it rolled out and was so simple to start up and use. Thank you Acer for a great and easy to use laptop. I am a dedicated Acer consumer !!","After 2 months it would not turn on .. I was told it's a hardware problem .","I have a DELL that I bought in 2005 running XP.  It runs Office, Acrobat, Photoshop just fine but it is finally becoming hard to use online - warnings to update my browser, operating system, etc.  I paid $600 for it.  I paid only $350 for this last week.  How could I have gotten such a bargain?  Lower quality, poor performance out of the box is how.  Following the excellent advice here,  I bought an SSD drive and more memory.  Sure enough, out of the box this computer takes *forever* to boot.  With the upgrades, I am up and running in no time at all.  Just a bit faster than my DELL, and maybe 1\/10 of the time it was before the upgrades.  I installed a 500GB WD SSD, and upgraded to 8GB of RAM.  The big difference was the SSD.  Created a Windows 10 installer on a USB stick in a half hour, and it took 5 minutes to install on the SSD.  You have to format the SSD and that is all.  Two dimples are visible in the bezel around the keyboard, from underneath, like a screw stanchion or something is pressing upwards.  Very cheap, I am afraid.  If you buy this, upgrade the hard drive to SSD or you will be sorry.","And I mean that in a good way with this laptop! Yes there are better ones out there, but do you really have 600-2,000 to spend on a laptop right now without taking out a loan? Then this one is a pretty good choice. I am very stingy about my money (you are when you grow up poor) and I don't make snap decisions with it, especially with an investment like this. I got it to work from home and though I've only had it about a week I've got to say it's pretty damn good for the price and is definitely capable of working at home from. Someone said it was slow? I mean I guess if your used to pages loading in .5 seconds, it takes like 3 seconds max, really what takes the longest is downloading all my pictures onto it! FYI OneCloud only gives you 5GB for free and always asks for a paid upgrade so I just don't use it, a few flash drives will suffice and more SD cards. I haven't figured out the touch screen capabilities but when in tablet mode you can still use the mouse, maybe when I figure it out I'll like it but I was more interested in the desktop computer part without the hefty price tag. Great picture! You gotta tilt the screen just right for the crisp sharp look but that isn't much to complain about, better than my tablets screen, I think the material makes it kinda soft looking, I think it's anti glare or something. BUT as with all laptops it works best plugged in, the screen gets a touch dimmer in light after you do, and continues to darken as the battery wanes. Used it unplugged for about 5 hours before it hit 20%, and that was at half battery, so, it's good for on the go to, I'd bring the charger anyways. It's not to heavy either, it's a nice weight. Can handle a Maincoon cat sitting on it until I rushed over and moved him, he's about 10 pounds. Otherwise treat this like a baby and put it in high places if you have cats that like to sit on things, lol. Never used it outside in the sunlight so not sure how that works. Hope this was helpful because if theres someone like me, you don't like to waste your cash and like to get quality, this is def a good start until you can get those higher priced ones. This even connects to your Xbox and has gaming capabilities ! Pretty good for under 500$","I do not hate this computer, but I do not love it either.  The case is incredibly cheap feeling.  The edges are slightly raised from the keyboard deck and it is uncomfortable to touch.  The Acer I replaced was a tank and this is much lighter.  The keyboard is somewhat mushy and I find I start my fingers on the wrong keys much more frequently and I am an expert typist, so this is strange.  Internet connectivity is much slower than on the SIX year old machine I replaced.  I picked this machine for the ultra cheap price, but I thought it would be better than it is.  The specs are ok and are sufficient for what I do, e.g. play games on POGO, stream movies, Hulu, tv shows, etc. I am planning on doing some transcription work and I am hoping this Acer is up to the challenge.","The computer is very slow in general since it isn\u2019t an SSD. Worked quickly once I installed a SSD and moved the OS to it. Ran into issues where a key was stuck so when I was trying to type things it kept putting the number 1 in between each letter I typed. The next issue I had was that when I was on a web page and scrolling, once I stopped scrolling, the touchpad seemed to think I was still scrolling and would immediately go to the bottom of the page no matter what. I tried reinstalling the OS and updating all of the firmware which didn\u2019t work. I sent the computer to acer to have fixed through their 1 year warranty. When I got it back the diagnosis was that they reinstalled the OS and upgraded the bios. As soon as I booted it up, the one key kept doing it\u2019s thing and it still scrolled down. I immediately contacted acer and asked why all they did was reinstall stuff and they said they couldn\u2019t recreate the problem. I left instructions in the computer on how to recreate both problems and that is exactly how I found out that both problems were still there. All Acer could do was have me send the computer back so they could try and fix it. They wouldn\u2019t reopen the old case and said that it would definitely be fixed this time. I didn\u2019t trust them and may have used some not so nice language at the person taking to me but at this point I had a new computer that I had barely used for 3 weeks which was meant to be an in between computer from my old laptop to a desktop that I want to build and I didn\u2019t  feel confident in their support staff. Not going to buy Acer ever again and debating if I want to buy another laptop or just use the money to buy the desktop parts now.  I don\u2019t mind sending a computer in once to get fixed. I understand that things happen, but for their support staff to not be able to recreate a problem where you literally hit the key once and it stay on until you restart it is unacceptable.","Screen turns off and won't turn back on if I close the lid when the laptop is on.  It isn't on \"sleep\", \"standby\" or \"hibernate\". I disabled those functions from happening automatically in the power settings. I have cats and if i leave my laptop screen up while I'm not working on it, my cats will walk over the keyboard. I've always just closed the lid to go to the bathroom\/kitchen whatever. I come back and lift the lid and 50% of the time, the screen won't light back up. I have to press and hold the \"power\" button on keyboard, lose my work and reboot it. It's frustrating and annoying. So now, I have to manually put my computer to \"sleep\", close the lid and then wait for \"sleep\" to come back. Sounds like it's not a big deal, but gmail doesn't receive new emails while on sleep etc. I have to refresh some tabs. That's the only bad thing about this laptop.","This computer isnterribly slow it does not have powerful processing and the battery doesn\u2019t last 13.5 hours. Half of the info on this laptop is dalse","This computer is a great value.  Unfortunately I have never like Windows 10, so I use a different operating system.  There is quite a bunch of crapware preloaded, but it only takes a bit of time to delete all of that.  Speed and memory are really good.  I bought mine on Prime Day and am completely satisfied with the product.  I've had other Acer laptops before and have always gotten good service from them.  This is a good computer at a good price.","I would have given this device five stars. The black light picture is horrible on this computer and is washed out. Meaning if you do not sit perfectly still at a certain point, you still you cannot see the screen at 100%. Returned it immediately and got my money back. Thank god amazon is awesome with returns. Ended up buying a different laptop that blew away this screen for 500$. This is not a defect it is the way they built it and went super cheep on the screen quality. Do not buy it, is not worth the money. Make sure when it says HD it is 1080 To myself their HD picture quality is misleading to say the least. I'm sure other reviews state the same problem TY","Summary: Computer sits at 100% disk usage for a majority of it's operation, even with no applications running. This causes it to be so slow it is unusable. I have built a couple of computers previously, work as an IT Consultant, and generally am decently technologically savvy when it comes to computers. The specs on this computer seemed pretty decent for the price, but the performance is terrible. None of the 100% disk usage fixes worked. The computer sits at 100% disk usage, possibly dropping down to 99% disk usage, before jumping back up to 100%. This occurs even if the only application open is Task Manager to monitor the disk usage.  I have had 4 different computers, 3 of them laptops, running windows 10 before and never run into this issue. After doing some research, it looks like this isn't an unheard of issue with multiple guides and reddits discussing the problem. I tried everything I could find, from disabling the WPR system collector, turning off windows search, turning off superfetch, running Check Disk, resetting the virtual memory, etc. No solutions worked. I contacted Acer feeling defeated I was unable to fix it. My thought was that it was probably a hardware issue at this point. Acer wanted me to run through all the same fixes, so I did. Then they wanted me to create a windows boot drive and try with a fresh, clean install. I did that too, without success. When I contacted them again, they wanted me to ship the computer to them to fix. Unfortunately the shipping cost isn't included. At this point I've been trying to get this computer working like it should have out of the box for several months. I'll have to pay more for them to potentially fix it. I think it would make more sense to just invest in a ssd upgrade for it and see if that solves the issue, since it seems to be solely the hard drive that is failing. If that works I'll probably skip the repair time\/costs. Haven't had a good experience with this computer. Out of the gate if you just buy a ssd that might be a better experience for you. Best of luck. If you don't need a mobile computer, build a desktop. Best bang for the buck every time and you know exactly what is in it.","I basically purchased for use with Serato Pro DJ 2.1.2 and Virtual DJ. After a quick ssd upgrade, ram and fresh install of windows 10, the laptop is as quick as an i5. I'm a pc enthusiast, trust my assessment, I've always used i5's in my rigs and current rig is an i7. The computer boots to desk top 15-20 seconds and programs load on time, every time. This is the ram I used. Crucial 4GB Single DDR3\/DDR3L 1866 MT\/s (PC3-14900) Unbuffered SODIMM 204-Pin Memory - CT51264BF186DJ $19.99 I installed a sandisk ultra 2 ssd as well, any ssd should be fine though. Now, I only used one of these and I removed the 2gb stick. I use AIDA-64 to read motherboard specs in windows and it won't show if the ram is in dual channel since the timings from this stick are different from the original 4gb stick still in there but the performance assures me it most likely is dual channel. A few issues and very strange at that include: I attempted to install windows 10 pro and it won't activate, even though the home version I installed first, with the supplied hdd, supposedly activated windows 10 with a digital license. This means that the windows key that activated the operating system is supposed to be tied to the non volatile memory on the mother. In essence, any time windows 10 is installed in the future, no matter the key used, window will recognize the motherboard and know it should activate the OS. It does not do this in any fashion when installing PRO, Pro wont activate. I don't really care though as my only use for this laptop is SERATO! The battery was dead on arrival. I mean no juice what so ever and the charger is not Acer brand. I Was forced to plug in to get it started. I think I'm ok with this off brand charger. I've used plenty over the years and they all seem to be fine. The fact that the laptop is cheap means you need to do those upgrades. Don't want to upgrade it, then just buy the better model cause any pc or laptop with a hdd is downright despicable. 7\/16\/2019::Update: Public service annoucement: If you set a bios password, example: hello, the first letter will be capital...Hello, but you wont know or realize it until you try to login like me. I was stumped until a friend helped me out. Damn you Acer! Nice laptop but crazy sittuation and ya\u2019ll should know!","Be Warned with Acer Laptops or any other computer purchased from Amazon. Should a defect occur after 30 days from purchase, Amazon will not take it back or exchange it for another. They will refer you to the manufacturer and then you will be in for an experience.  For example, Acer will tell you to bring the defective computer to their repair center which happens to be in Temple, Texas, So just incase you happen to live elsewhere you will have to repackage your laptop and send it to that facility and engender the cost and wait upon Acer conducting a repair. According to the Acer Tech Rep. I should bring it back to the store where it was purchased. Don't know how this can be done with Amazon as they will not handle it even though the laptop may still be under warranty and was purchased six weeks prior (remember the 30 day return cut-off). Further  should the laptop not be able to be repaired it will be returned to you and you are s--- out of luck. In fact Amazon will not honor that as well.","PRO: This is my  fourth Acer Aspire, but the quality has plummeted. I got a new Acer Aspire and it booted up with a dead screen. Amazon replaced it immediately :-)  The replacement came, and I spent time upgrading the memory to 16GB and the disk to a 500GB SSD, installed Linux and it runs great for the money! I have done this upgrage to Acer Apires three time and have been really pleased. CON: Unfortunately  after 5 days of operation, the keyboard backlight failed. Not just  a matter of FN-F9 to turn it off\/on, the hardware has failed already.This is a really important feature to me because the keyboard is black and hard to use without the backlight. Nonetheless, I have too much time into this to restore the original disk and memory, ship the unit back and start over again --  so maybe I'll just live with it :-( Acer Aspire is great performance for the price, and easy to  upgrade, but the product build quality seems to have gone down  the drain.  This is sadly my last Acer.","I've had this laptop for about three months now, and am very happy with it. It was good with the stock configuration, but slow to boot up due to the standard 1 tb hdd. I added a M2 ssd drive and replaced the 2gb memory stick with a 4 gb for a total of 8gb dual channel memory. The boot time is now under 30 seconds, and I only spent $60 for both. Here are my upgrades; https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B01M3Z46FQ\/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0145V6NUA\/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 I also got an Amazon Basics usb 3.1 \"c\" hub to reduce clutter. I also have an hdtv hooked up to use as a second moniter. It would have been nice if I could have gotten a hub with hdmi included, but the \"c\" port is only gen. 1. No touch screen, but I never used the one on my last laptop. What I am doing is using the ssd for the system, and the 1tb hdd for my programs and data. I kept the sytem files on the hdd as a backup in case the ssd dies. I also use Macrium Reflect Free to regularly back every thing up. I am not a big gamer, so this system is perfect for my needs. I feel that I got a real bargain for only $400 total.","When I was looking for a new laptop, I needed something that was fast, had plenty of storage, and could run Sims 4. The size of this computer, while intimidating at first, has since proved to be perfect for me. I love the 1080p resolution, and I'll never have to worry about storage ever again. I was a bit apprehensive as to whether it would play Sims 4, mostly because I've never purchased a computer for myself, but since receiving the Acer E 15 I've now created and destroyed many virtual families. Not only does Sims 4 run perfectly, including mods and expansions, but I have finally been able to return from my 7+ year World of Warcraft hiatus. I finally have a computer that can play both of my favorite games so smoothly and I still can't believe I only paid $350 for this beauty. Don't bother paying extra for shipping because I didn't and it showed up in two days anyway.","It does not play DVD movies. Had to buy a external DVD player because I didn't feel like sending it back and waiting on return. It's a gift and the person I am sending it to does not internet. So trying to setup everything and purchase DVD software because Win10 does not come with the ability to play out of the box, I find out the player is not compatible to play DVD disc, unless they are burned disc. They should really tell you in description that it does not play DVD's. So if you have a library of DVD's and you want to buy this laptop, skip it.","My machine was dying so I ordered this one...two days before Black Friday.  Had no choice.  Now you can get it for $55 less than I did two days ago.  I will say that is a great machine and you are getting a lot for your dollar.  Don't be concerned that you can't get much computer for this price...nothing could be further from the truth.  I am very happy with it.  Plenty fast.  Get rid of the bloatware (like the installed Norton...and find a not so intrusive security software) that it comes loaded with and that drive won't have to hunt and peck so much.  I added an 8 gig flash drive and configured it for dedicated Ready Boost (gonna have to Google that one).  If you already have an external SSD you could configure about 4 gigs of that for RB. Sped things up by about 5-10% depending. Not bad for $8.  Things got snappy.  Plenty of RAM (8 would be nicer but 6 will do.  At 5,400 MHz the drive is not the fastest but as I said if you keep it clean you will be well served.  Unless you are gaming I suspect you will really like this machine.  If you have questions just ask.","LIKES 1. keyboard feels nice and responsive 2. 1080p display 3. M.2 slot 4. 6Gb RAM, i3 8xxxu cpu 5. light weight 6. curved\/indented base to allow air flow to components 7. other specs are nice: bluetooth etc DISLIKES 1. could not easily find a manual.(i was planning on buying a M.2 PCIe SSD to upgrade the storage but i couldn't find documentation to confirm compatibility. i bought a regular SATA SSD instead). 2. the battery cannot easily be removed. you have to remove the back. again lack of access to documentation. 3. viewing angles on the screen is not good. screen looks dark. probably not an IPS Screen 4. have to hold down function key to raise or lower volume( an issue for the main user) it runs well. i have an ssd installed and it boots quickly. price reasonable for the specs it has.  i has recommended it to others.","I have to start by saying my last laptop was purchased in 2010 and for 5x as much as this one cost me. The battery and charger need to be replaced, but it was still nearly 15lbs when put together. A desktop replacement if anything. I was not expecting much for the price when I ordered this laptop and I have never owned an acer before. I ordered a Samsung 970 Evo SSD to go along with this and left the 6gb of ram stock for now until prices come down. This is an everyday\/work computer for me and I love that it is light and fast. It doesn't heat up on me or have the fans roaring at all times. Something I didn't realized I'd miss is the backlit keyboard, but I'll be sure to get that in another ~10 years. All in all a great purchase for the price. Please just don't complain about it being slow if you don't get yourself an SSD and watch a video on how to install one! Any computer you buy in 2019 and forward should have one as a boot device. The manufacturers will continue to put spinning, larger capacity hard drives in for a while.","sending this back for refund, wanted a replacement but was not given that option. I like it for a couple days than started making crunchy like noise. The noise concerns me. And one time it would not turn back on until I plugged it into power supply-the battery read at 60%, no clue what that was about. The computer has good reviews and the price is good so I am going to take chance and order another one as soon as refund is token care of. After I have new one for couple weeks I will update this review.","warning - when you purchase this also buy a cheap 16 (maybe 32 gb to be safe) usb 2.0 (or if you want to splurge usb 3.0) thumb drive that you will label and put away forever never to be used again until and if you need to restore your laptop back to it's original (from the factory) condition, see below ... even better, google bf ads hot deals and slickdeals, sign up for alerts for them that have to do with acronis true image and look for a free after rebates or cheap after rebates alert ... in combination with the m.2 ssd drive you really should install (see below) you can then use Acronis to do regular backups of your C drive which is an even better solution (don't have to reinstall all  those Windows updates and\/or lose your documents for example).  And spring for a m.2 ssd drive at the same time you get this laptop too (see below) - if you can, wait for the September (back to school) or November\/December sales when prices drop on all that stuff plus this laptop itself.  GET THE M.2. SSD DRIVE NOT A \"NORMAL\" SSD DRIVE .. that is you want the SSD drive that looks like a \"stick\" , that way you can still use the hard drive  that originally came with the laptop for additional hard drive storage space for your files or whatever... if you get the \"non-stick\" (non m.2.) version of an SSD drive  that will force you into replacing the \"normal\" hard drive from your laptop and you lose out on that money-wise (besides which you'll be happy with the m.2 drive far as it's speed and it's really not that expensive compared to a \"normal\" ssd drive, at least as far as the adata brand). I'll start out by saying you should read Louie's super helpful review (look for the one he posted July 17th 2018) ... helped me a lot though I took a slightly different approach than he did but I'm sure his approach works fine too :) .. in my case I used ... well it used to be called the msconfig command in the old days, now I think you just use task manager, go to startup and disable the programs you don't need to automatically start up when the laptop does (you'll  have to do some research on google if you're not familiar with them but it's pretty easy to figure out if you do the work) to further boost the laptop's speed. In my case I just googled  \"youtube, acer aspire e15 install m.2 ssd drive\" to find a youtube video called Aspire E15 How to Install an M.2 SSD Drive  (put out by acer themselves the manufacturer) which outlines how to  basically create media (you'll need a 16 GB or bigger usb drive I found usb 2.0 speed works fine but if you're not cheap like me I'm guessing usb 3.0 speed would be faster) you use to reinstall Windows if necessary .. the video also describes step by step everything you need to do on the hardware and software side to get that m.2 ssd drive  up and running on your laptop. Upgrading the memory\/RAM.. eh, you could if you wanted to but I find the m.2 ssd drive makes the laptop plenty fast enough for our purposes (do stuff on the internet, watch videos, microsoft word documents ) even if you just leave the 6 GB of memory as is... let's face it, this is not a gaming laptop so I would seriously question the need for more memory than what's already installed if you install that m.2 ssd drive. I followed Louie's advice as far as the ADATA SU800 M.2 2280 m.2 ssd drive except I sprung for the 512 GB sized one instead (model number ASU800NS38-512GT-C just do a search using that on amazon) and very happy with it so far works great :)  (though I know people who swear by using HP  brand drives only so up to you I guess but can state with certainty the adata works no problem with this laptop)... I have to disagree with other reviewers who say the screw you need to remove from the laptop to install the m.2 ssd drive is easy..  not sure if the factory machines were overly enthusiastic when assembling this laptop but I literally had to clamp onto that screw with a pair of pliers, clench and turn just to get the darn screw off (and yes I was using the \"correct\" screwdriver for it so not sure what was going on there)... of course the screw would not go back into place either once I had the ssd drive in there... fortunately for me the \"hatch\" you unscrew on the back of the laptop to get access to the memory and hard drives has three screws - one of those worked just fine to secure the ssd drive in place so I swapped that with the SSD drive screw which is now the \"middle\" of the three screws securing that \"hatch\" in place on the laptop shell\/cover.  But that was annoying, wasted a good 30 minutes struggling with that stupid ssd screw before finally giving up on it. Of course I kept the hard drive that originally came with the laptop too and made sure that got reinstalled into the laptop when I got the ssd drive  up and running .. while 512 GB of storage on the SSD drive  should be plenty for my purposes it's nice having that 1 TB  (original hard drive) of space for documents when and if I start to run out of room on the SSD drive... as well, the 1 TB of hard drive is a handy destination point for the Acronis backups I mentioned previously.  I've found Acronis to be kind of weird although maybe I'm just not using it correctly.. sometimes it will let me save a backup of the \" C \" drive  onto the same C drive, other times it insists the backup MUST be on a different drive  than the C drive... quite honestly it's a good idea to put your backup on a different drive than the C drive anyways in case the C drive gets totally wrecked...  if you followed my advice  and installed that m.2 ssd drive that problem is already taken care of... just tell Acronis to backup your C drive (which is now the m.2. ssd drive) onto the other drive (the 1 TB drive that originally came with the laptop) and you're good to go.  Do that maybe  once a month to keep your backups current  or if you like just let Acronis routinely backup your stuff by itself (though doing that will slow down your laptop - by how much I don't know since I just program a reminder in Microsoft Outlook to backup all the PC's in the house with Acronis once per month to avoid slowing down any of my PC's).  I found the backup of the C drive contents using Acronis to be very fast. I would also sign up for alerts for Norton Security  (or whatever antivirus\/firewall program you prefer though I've had great success with Norton over  the years - helpful hint, check with your internet service provider, if you didn't know this already it's possible they will give you antivirus\/firewall protection free of charge for your PC's as part of the service you're already paying for)  through bfads or slickdeals .. it's nice that the laptop comes with a trial version of Norton installed but once that runs out the last thing you want to do is pay full price for Norton like it will prompt you to do, look for a discounted  price on Norton instead (or even better yet free if your internet service provider will  do that for you). I suppose if you're okay with slow computers you could just use the computer as is without the m.2. ssd drive upgrade but I wouldn't recommend it.. I've been spoiled by the SSD drive experience  with my desktop computers and find non-ssd drive  computers to be painfully slow.. the upgrade really isn't that expensive nor is the install  all that difficult and you will  see a vast improvement in the laptop's performance. If you want to be extra safe, get yourself a usb 3.0 thumb drive and plug that into one of the blue colored usb 3.0 slots on the laptop... every time you generate an important file back it up onto that thumb drive.  Of course when you run the Acronis backup each month you can then \"clean out\" the usb 3.0 thumb drive (delete the files) since you just backed  up those files, but it's a nice little extra feature to preserve those important files.. or just take advantage of google's free drive storage and upload  the files to there until you can do your next Acronis backup.  Alternately just store your documents on that 1 TB hard drive that came with the laptop originally but then you have to have a way to backup those files to be on the safe side (maybe the usb 3.0 thumb drive)... I'm a fan of samsung's fit drives due to their small shape - I found the hard way the big thumb  drives have a nasty habit of breaking off inside the usb slot if your computer drops or gets moved the wrong way, small thumb drives aren't as likely to break since they're not sticking so far out of your PC (helpful hint - see if the older model of the samsung fit 3.0 thumb  drives is selling, practically the same performance  and much cheaper) I would strongly recommend a good laptop cooler for any laptop (their number one enemy is the hard drive in it overheating over  the years) - I've had great success with the Deepcool N8 or N7 model laptops due to their solid construction and the sheer amount of aluminum used in it which allows it to act as a great heatsink even without the fans running (heavy and somewhat sharp corners but worth it in my opinion)... note that you'll want to plug any laptop cooler into the right side of the laptop so that when you turn the laptop off the fans on the laptop turn off too ... if you plug the laptop cooler into the usb ports on the left side the fans will continue to run off the laptop's power  even when the laptop is turned off which is bad (fans will stop working if you run them non-stop day and night like that)... something to do with the hubs on the left providing power to usb devices and the hub on the right not so much. Overall very happy with this laptop especially given the price paid for it .. not good for a gamer but great for a college student or home user looking for a budget laptop for day-to-day or school needs (unless you're a video game or graphic designer or something who needs a high powered device - in which case you're probably looking for a more expensive laptop and not even reading this review anyways :P ) ..","Do not buy this laptop.  It has so many things wrong with it: Sometimes the computer won\u2019t turn on when I push the power button  Two lights are lit, but nothing happens.  I then push the power button until the 2d light turns off, wait a few seconds, then push the power button again.  It opens on the second try.  When I first bought the laptop and for several months thereafter, the box for the password did not automatically appear until I pushed Control\/Alt\/Delete. The computer won\u2019t wake up when it goes into sleep mode.  I have to turn it off by pushing the power button until the 2d light turns off, wait a few seconds, then push the power button again.  I have selected \u201dnever sleep\u201d in the settings, but that did not fix the problem. The cursor has always been unusually sensitive, if not to say totally out of control.  For example, I may be reading Facebook and the cursor decides I should be reading another tabbed page.  It opens that tab.  Pop-ups randomly pop up.  The sensitivity of the cursor  is incredibly frustrating when I play card games; it randomly picks up a card that causes me to lose the game.  I have tried adjusting the sensitivity settings for both the touchpad and the mouse but that does not fix the problem. I had a chat with customer service.  The warranty was still in effect, but Acer refused to refund the purchase price because, they claimed, the warranty didn't cover a refund. (The warranty says they will refund the purchase price)  They offered to troubleshoot with me, but I am a (very) senior citizen and can't cope. They offered to repair the laptop, but I turned them down because the problems have occurred sequentially and as soon as the repaired laptop was returned, I expect something new to develop. I do not recommend that anyone torture themselves as I have.","I am quite pleased with this laptop so far. My point of reference for this review as far as level of performance is my current laptop that is being retired: SONY VIAO, Windows 7 Home Premium, 500GB HDD, 2.4GHz Intel Core i3-2370M, 1366x768 14.5\" screen, 6GB RAM, 64 bit. So, basically this is a somewhat near replacement. 1. Having an HD screen is very nice...colors crisp, clear and brilliant...the extra screen size is a bonus for me. 2. BTW, I do not use this laptop for gaming. 3. Response is very quick, even with multiple applications open. 4. Doesn't have a back-lit keyboard like my VIAO, but that's OK...I don't work in subdued light. 5. I use this acer for some WORD and EXCEL, but mainly web browsing, Arduino, Python & video editing. 6. My complaints would be mainly with Microsoft Windows 10, but that would take too much space!! 7. Overall I am happy with this purchase...I have been familiar with acer monitors for years, so this selection wasn't too   much of a stretch. 8. I find the fan noise is nearly imperceptible, contrary to a couple other user comments. 9. I am having some issues with the DVD\/CD player due to familiarity of how the device is recognized, but I am learning   that again is a Windows 10 issue\/problem.","Out of the box this is a great budget laptop. Build quality is good-very good, screen is very good (better than most reviews indicate), keyboard layout is okay, touch pad is smooth and responsive, and the laptop works exactly as it is supposed to. My only concern is the flimsiness of the power supply and my only gripe is the lack of backlit keyboard. But over all this is a solid 5 star laptop in its price range of $379 and ridiculously good for the $319 I paid for it on Black Friday. After spending a day with it I popped off the bottom plate and doubled the RAM to 12gb and added a 128gb M.2 SSD. Wow! This thing was reasonably fast before, now it's blazing. Makes my HP 850 G2 with 5th gen i5 processor and 8gb of RAM seem slow. Do not hesitate to buy this laptop, especially if you have an extra $26 for an SSD. Unless you get a rare Acer lemon you will be very pleased.","This computer works very well for it's pricepoint. The hard drive and ram slots are in fact easily accessible, and the placement of the sd card reader on the front is very convenient and appreciated as opposed to on the side where many others have placed it. The usb-c port next to the vga is also great in providing both forward and backward compatibility. The only disappointment is that the computer must basically be disassembled to access the battery. The reason that I bought this computer was to allow for simple servicing and in-fact passed up many others for the reason that it was hard to access components without prying. Nowhere did I see this in the description and it is the one drawback in what is otherwise a nearly perfect laptop. The usb-2 slot on the right also seems to have become a bit wobbly as well after a few months of having a mouse dongle in it, that is rarely removed.","I got it yesterday.  It was pretty easy to install except it would not accept my email passwords.  Kept telling me they were incorrect.  For setting up with Microsoft, you have to do this.  It did take my phone number thou and send me a text so I managed to get thru the process that way.  Not thrilled about that.  Why it did not take my CORRECT password is fishy to me.  Anyway, I was frustrated with the slowness of it.  I also had issues with the battery.  It says right on the labtop 12 hours battery power.  Well it would not give me more than say 3.75 hours when I clicked on the bottom battery icon.  So I charged it more over night.  Got up and checked it out.  It gave me 4.75 approx hours.  I fiddled around with batter power settings and finally called them.  We went thru a lengthy process of resetting the battery.  At the end he told me that I just have to time the battery myself.  See if it stays on the twelve hours despite what the icon says on the bottom of the screen.  Ok, just great.  Also had an issue with screen size shrinking.  You know its fine them wamb, you touch the touch key pad and it shrinks your page down to tiny itsy bitsy can't read?  You have no clue why.  Well he showed me what to do.  You go to the upper right and click on the setting icon, top of page.  Mine is three lines.  Search for zoom and put it on 100 or whatever you want.  What a pain, but atleast I know what to do.  I wanted to turn this option off.  He said that is not possible.  Don't care for that.  Pluses of the laptop.  Price is good.  The customer service was good, but he had a thick latino accent and I had to insist he slow down.  I could not understand a single word he said.  What's up with that?  He was nice thou, slowed down and we managed to get thru it all, but it was work trying to understand him.  Lots of \"what?\"  or \"I can't undrestand you.  Say it again.\"  Oh boy.....set up was pretty easy.  I'm still not sure about it to be honest.  I sure hope I don't end up sending it back.  That's my take thou.","I have a pros\/cons list at the bottom if you want to skip right to it. As a replacement for a Dell Inspiron 13 (a 2015 model that had been passed around on eBay), I was really excited to purchase this laptop. The aforementioned was showing its signs of wear and mishandling by multiple college students, myself included, and needed to be replaced before it fell apart completely. After being stuck on an awkward 1366x768 monitor, an FHD screen was first on the list. The screen is fine all things considered, but you have to be facing it head on or else the colors get affected by the backlight, my older laptop was the same but allowed much more freedom in viewing angles before the colors turned south. Much adjusting of the screen is required if you aren't sitting still with the laptop on a hard surface in front of you. Long battery life was something my old laptop did not have and came in at a mediocre six hours. The battery life on this webpage suggests 13.5 hours, but it shipped to me with a sticker in the upper right corner that said 12 hours. The sticker at the bottom of the keyboard says it's a proper 392H, perhaps the battery life sticker was a mistake (595 BM model anyone), or is the page here on Amazon misleading? Anyways, I have yet to entirely evaluate the battery life but I can say that it is a definitive step up. Plugging it in to charge it does require a bit of finesse and wiggling around but once you get it in, it's in. That 90-degree angle is a welcome addition over having the charging cord stick straight out. Storage options, previously I was just stuck with your regular SATA based storage in the form of either an HDD or an SSD, of which I previously opted for the latter. Reading that this laptop offers an M.2 slot I had felt it would be a great replacement for my M.2 which was replaced with an NVME drive in my desktop. I can't attest to the speed differences between the M.2 and SSD since they're both pretty much the same, both are silent, and that's about it. Sadly I can only have one storage option in this laptop at a time, can't go dual storage with a drive and an M.2. The 8th gen CPU is also a fair step up over my old laptop since it doesn't get anywhere as hot but then again that might be because this laptop has actual air intake vents in the bottom and a much larger exhaust fan. Dare I mention that the fan itself is also fairly quiet as well? It's certainly quieter than the heating vent under my bed when the furnace kicks on. The RAM is 6GB of DDR3... wait, 6GB? So I have to sell this stick and buy two 4GB sticks? Okay, I knew this going into it, but why such an odd choice? I've already had one memory related BSOD two weeks into usage, a particular BSOD I never had on the previous laptop (where I ran 8GB) which is alarming considering I've cut down on my multitasking. Don't get me wrong, I can work with 6GB, but why not offer a 4 or 8GB (4+4) version? The keyboard, this was one of the more subpar elements. For starters, the lack of a backlight makes your only light source at night with no lights on is the screen itself. I like considering myself a good touch typist but just seeing the keys and only needing to glance down to get your bearings instead of the tactile F\/J bumps, it changes the experience for me in a way I don't like. The function keys are underused since the volume and backlight keys are represented by the arrow keys which in my mind is simply a bad practice. F1 and 2 are empty which could be used for brightness, while F9-11 are empty which could be used for volume and mute keys. The caps lock key does not have a visual indicator requiring you to type to see if it is engaged. The power button is a key in the upper right corner of the keyboard. I can't tell you how many times I've pressed this as I've grabbed the laptop to move it around. There appears to be a key to even bring up the right click menu in between the right alt and ctrl buttons. Isn't the touchpad enough? Speaking of the touchpad, it has a quirk to it. While the lower corners are their respective left and right click buttons the upper touchpad itself also doubles as buttons where the left half is left click, and vice versa. I haven't heard about this in any articles or anywhere on the Amazon page or comments section so maybe this is just a bug with my particular unit? All that aside, the keys themselves feel nice with a good amount of travel and an un-distracting noise. Given that the number pad is to the left, it will take a bit of adjustment to get used to, but so far this hasn't been an issue. The touchpad itself feels great, is responsive, and has a lovely accent for a border. The media inputs on the side are of acceptable quality featuring USB 3, C, and HDMI for all your modern computing needs. VGA I suppose is acceptable if you still use the port for projectors or to hook up to an older TV and... that is an ethernet port right? I thought those were fatter than this. The one thing that I don't really like was the CD\/DVD drive. If you want to watch a movie on the plane, that's fine, but there are standalone disk drives that you can get for $15. Copy the disk as an mp4 and you're done, easy peasy. In the end, I feel like the CD\/DVD drive would just be an unnecessary expense that was thrown on for the majority that will never use it to satisfy the minority who will all so ACER could pad the bottom line. Nothing against it, but why should we spend more? The speakers are bottom firing... *headdesk headdesk headdesk headdesk headdesk* My old laptop had thin side firing speakers which were, okayish, but these ones just... no... They deserve to be on the top. I mean, if the table was sentient and listening to the music, I guess it would be having a darn good time with that TrueHarmony, but tables do not listen to music. For what it is, the speakers are fine, but their placement is very questionable. The body of the laptop is, well what can I say, it's sturdy. Perhaps it was the thinness of the previous laptop but merely picking it up one-handed caused the frame to creak and bend. You don't get an iota of that with this. The laptop is textured in a way that is nice to the touch, although it's dark surface would expose fingerprints under the correct lighting. I haven't even accessed the BIOS yet, I should do that but I never get a prompt... If you don't know what this is, don't go looking. It's probably like that for a reason. Finally, the startup time is awesome. I recently purchased a Western Digitial M.2 NVME drive (WDS500G2X0C) and between pressing the power button to logged in is ~5 seconds. Now, for those of you that just want the quick and easy: Screen: + FHD - Poor viewing angles Battery: + Solid 12 - 13 hours Note: After testing I averaged about 9 hours based on my usage patterns. + 90-degree angle coming off the barrel plug + Doesn't heat up when charging Storage: + M.2 capiable (slient operation) - No option for dual SATA+M.2 CPU: + 8th gen does not heat up under moderate load or while watching videos + Adequate and quiet cooling solution RAM: +\/- Single 6GB +\/- DDR3 Keyboard+Touchpad - No backlight - Underused function keys (volume\/brightness regulated to volume keys) - No caps lock indicator + Good key travel on pressing + Doesn't sound too loud + Touchpad and palm rest have a quality texture Note: A few bugs are mentioned at the end concerning the trackpad Inputs: + USB 3+C + HDMI +\/- DVD\/CD drive +\/- VGA Speakers: +\/- Acceptable quality - Downward firing Body: + Solid BIOS: ~ Unreviewed Startup Time (WD M.2 drive - WDS500G2X0C): + 5 seconds Looking back, it's a good laptop if you don't mind all the little problems, but to me, this is one that suffered a death by a million cuts. The base package is fine but all the little issues have really built up to make it a merely acceptable experience. Considering I got this on Black Friday, for $310 I'm not entirely let down but I still feel like this will be a laptop that ends up returned at the end of the day come late December or even January. Considering I still have a month and a half to change my mind, who knows, maybe I'll come around but I'm pretty sure my mind is made up on this. If you do not care for the little problems I have described above, it's a great value for under 400, a steal for under 325, anything less than 300 is simply highway robbery. Good play ACER, but I don't think this is for me. The ball is in your court. Edit - 1\/27 ------------- Well after working out the laptops quirks I've decided that indeed, this isn't the laptop for me. The lack of a backlight for the keyboard is what hurts the most. I'd say that is then followed up by the viewing angles and speakers. The 6gb of RAM started becoming problematic, I'd strongly suggest replacing the second two gig stick with either a four gig one or removing it entirely. Finally, I don't know if it was said lack of ram or something to do with my touchpad, but I didn't experience this with either my previous laptop or the wireless mouse I use with my desktop... Sometimes while browsing I'd be scrolling down the page when the page would suddenly stop scrolling with the two-finger touch. No matter how much I scrolled, it wouldn't move. Since my cursor was still usable, this forced me to click and drag the scroll bar or switch to another window\/program before scroll would start working again. The issue came and went early on, but in the last few weeks it's been very prominent and I don't understand why. I still have half a gig of RAM left over so I'm not bumping into that ceiling, and the CPU is only at an intermittent 40% load. Everything is fine when I use my wireless mouse which leads me to assume the fault lies with the trackpad. As I wrap up this review and shut down this laptop, I feel like the experience was a good one, but ultimately a laptop that suffered death by a thousand cuts like I mentioned in my original review. Cheers.","Bought this because my HP 2000 Notebook that I had for years been acting up and running really slow lately where I try lot of stuff to speed it up but nothing is worked. So for the review part. First thing is when I first used after the setup it would run really slow until I found out that the Windows 10 automatic updates were making it slow until the updates were done it which is running faster now. So keep in mind that the Windows 10 automatic updating basically do updates everything in one shot which is too much as well it's best pause all Windows Store app updates and use the internet until it done or it'll slow down the Windows 10 update. Now for the laptop hardware function which has some small flaws. First is the volume and screen brightness controls which requires using the Fn button then use the control buttons that isn't too big of a deal but when comes changing the volume in a hurry when you're watching videos you sometimes come across parts where the sound is too loud where you have to turn down the volume in hurry but you to have push the Fn then the volume control which makes it inconvenient and annoying. The Caps Locks is another annoying because unlike most if all other laptops have a little light showing if the Caps Locks is on or off but this thing doesn't have it where it gets confusing if it's on or off until you memorize the pop icon on the screen that is the only to know if it's on or not. Another annoying thing is the touchpad part which doesn't have the left and right buttons like most standard laptops have which is bad if anyone has a difficult time with touchpads without the button parts it's best to planned ahead to get a mouse. The good if not the best thing about this laptop is the long battery life and the 1TB hard drive that is bit much memory for me as well the $350 was cheaper then most laptops that a includes DVD disc drive which is the only reasons why I haven't made it 3 stars or less.","very happy with this for my travel and power outages computer first thing I did was make a recovery drive following the instructions (took about 1 hour 15 minutes to make the drive) then put in an NVMe M.2 drive ( yes it can use an NVMe drive) and used recovery drive to set it up and booted to it much faster than with 5400RPM spinner boot times average 13 seconds used Crystal disk mark 6 to test speed and sequential speed are 1056.0 read 403.7 write. Ordered a 8GB RAM stick to bring it to 12GB RAM instead of the 6GB easy simple to do all the work 3 screws on bottom plate  pry off the cover the spin drive is simple pull back and slip out save in case you plan to trade off or sell it later and put the M.2 drive in and change out ram all under one cover simple easy to do even my Mother could understand. I tested the computer for time on battery power with DVD playing for 4 hours then music for 3 hours got down to 6% battery 41 minutes battery using external speakers that are only powered by the laptop not their own power source. Took about 2.5 hours with unit off to fully recharge the battery today I tested it with an external Bluray drive it played a 2 hour movie with about 1 hr 47 minutes remaining battery. WARNING if you create a recovery drive and use a larger drive than 16GB like I used a 64GB it partitioned the drive to a 32GB drive  and left the unused part UN-formatted I could not shrink it with disk management it totally re-formats the drive I able to use Partition Wizard to re-partition it to 16GB for recovery and the rest for DATA.","I purchased this laptop and I happened to have 16GB of RAM to put in it and I did get an NVMe drive to put in it (yes it DOES support NVMe SSD\/Intel Optane despite what Acer says here) the NVMe slot is x2 NOT the standard x4 so buying high end NVMe drives for this laptop would be a waste. The WD Blue 1TB NVMe drive does work great however and its top speed is only held back maybe 30% from being in x4 mode when I benched the drive in my desktop at x2 and x4 but that's only in benchmarks. I can still install Windows 10 on a VM located on this drive in about 12 minutes whether in x4 or x2 so real world difference is negligible but it can be felt over traditional SATA3 performance. Otherwise, this is a decent Linux machine for when I am away from the main desktop. Daily driver performance as well as heavy multitasking, basic video, and photo editing and CAD work (all open source Linux applications, not \"name brand\" software) work with no hiccups.","I purchased this laptop for the purpose of browsing the internet, minor content creation (writing papers for college), and some media consumption (streaming video). This laptop has delivered on all of these objectives. However, the one caveat is this: the laptop comes with a 1 TB mechanical hard drive that is clearly the bottleneck of this system. I replaced this hard drive within a few weeks of purchasing this laptop due to debilitating performance. I installed a value priced solid state hard drive from a major manufacturer and the performance of this laptop was instantly improved. I would not recommend this laptop unless you plan to replace the hard drive with an SSD. Thankfully the laptop has a very convenient M.2 slot for newer SSD's.","I have had this laptop for a few months now and I love it. It\u2019s very good for the price. I use this mostly for gaming. Here\u2019s a list of the games I can run at OK and playable settings: Batman Arkham asylum Batman Arkham city Grand theft auto San Andreas Grand theft auto vice city Bully LEGO Batman (all 3 games) A bunch of other LEGO games Both portal games Dead cells works great Idk I have a bunch of games that work decently and are playable. I recommend upgrading the RAM with at least 8gb of crucial ram. But honestly it just depends on what you plan to do with the laptop. The screen is a bit washed out but it still looks pretty good. The keyboard is nice. It does have a dvd drive, which in my case is a pretty big plus. Battery lasts about 5 hours. Also depends on what you\u2019re doing. Pretty fast and great for under $400. Definitely recommend this as it is a great budget friendly laptop. I do not regret this purchase at all.","Bought this to replace an older Toshiba. After reading through some of the other reviews I also purchased new RAM  (Samsung 16GB kit (2 x 8GB) DDR3 PC3L-12800,1600MHz, 204 PIN SODIMM) and a SSD (Crucial MX500 250GB 3D NAND SATA III 6Gb\/s M.2 2280) to replace the HDD.  Followed the process described by other reviewers and now have a decent dual-boot laptop with Win10 and Ubuntu. Good enough for browsing, light development and general computer work so far. Took about a day or so overall to image the original install, add new RAM and SSD and re-install  Win10 (offline custom install, turn all report-to-microsoft options to 'off' - max privacy, such as it is) and Ubuntu 18.04 with some apps for both (Firefox, anaconda, etc.).","I just bought this laptop with the 512 GB SSD.  I don't use it for gaming, but for general use it's awesome.  It does everything fast including starting up and shutting down.  Some people say that the RAM should be paired, and they are not wrong, but 6GB of RAM 4+2 is still better than 2+2.  I use this for streaming video, browsing the internet, watching Youtube, and storing information.  If I was going to use it for gaming I would choose a different laptop.  (I do that on my desktop which has a video card which is more expensive than this laptop)","UPDATE:  DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP, UNLESS YOU WANT TO REPLACE THE BATTERY EVERY 3 MONTHS.  I've used this stupid thing wireless 6 or 7 times and the battery is now DOA.  I don't know how they can claim with a straight face that you can get 12 or 13 hours out of their battery, when I only got 4 hours, when it I hooked it up in December 2018.  At the end of February, 2019, I needed a new battery.  The batteries are junk and these computers are JUST TOO CHEAP.  put out a hundred more bucks and buy something decent!!! The computer is selling much higher, than I bought it for a couple weeks ago and I'd certainly never pay what they're charging for it now.  Wish I'd thrown in a hundred more bucks and got something decent, but ewwww all the great reviews.  Yeah, right!!  I've had this thing a WEEK and a HALF and I had my last laptop NINE years with less problems than I've had with this thing.  I'll upgrade it and do everything I can to make it better.  Don't believe the reviews, this is a bottom of the line computer.  Pay extra and get something better or expect to do a lot to make it a better machine.  Yes, I knew it was a cheap computer.  Just not that cheap.  I'm not going to get into anything technical, because you can read that elsewhere.  I'll just tell you some of the problems.  (Trust me, there are More.) First off, it claims this is a \"12 HOUR BATTERY\"  Yes, I had it fully charged.  I was on it 4 hours and 13 minutes and the warning just came on that the battery was \"Running low and to find another power source.\"  WHAT???  The laptop is only 1 1\/2 weeks old!! 4 1\/2 Hours is nowhere close to 12 hours, as they tout.  This is while running an incredibly Dim Screen. I thought I'd like the Long Battery Life, but didn't like the fact that as soon as it goes to wireless, the screen brightness cuts in Half, without my permission or resetting it.  The computer decides for itself to do that.  It should have let ME make that decision, when cutting the resolution that drastically.  I don't like that.  I thought that the long battery life would make it more convenient to recharge my phone, on the go, when no ac outlet where available.  As it turns out, that LONG battery life, is NOT what they claim. MY BIGGEST BEEF SO FAR One thing I really don't like is the LAN port on the computer.  It's HORRIBLE.  Be prepared to replace a LOT of cables, so buy them CHEAP.  The reason, is because this laptop, like some others on the market, doesn't have a \"Normal Port.\"  You have to angle your connector to get it in and work a stiff opening up, with your connector.  .  The opening is half the normal size.  I used my laptop wireless exactly THREE times and my connector BROKE.  I had another new one on hand, so I used it.  After the second time going wireless with the laptop, the connector end, going into the computer became so loose that it started FALLING OUT, if you barely touched it.  ARGH!!  IT astonishes me why people aren't mentioning this.  After I called the toll free number, Acer told me how to do it and I was doing it right.  Really?  I wish I wasn't, because I don't relish having to buy a 10 pack of 6 foot cables.  Trust me, I'll be buying cheap ones and searching for closeouts.  This is my biggest beef on this computer, because a laptop is basically made to be used wireless a good deal of the time.  That means connecting & disconnecting and they should have taken that into account, when making the one and only LAN port.  Plus, it's so hard to do, forget about doing it in dim light, you can't even feel the stupid thing.  You have to turn the lights on to hook your laptop back up.  I've always just been able to plug it back it, because it was easily found.  NOPE!!  Not now.  You better turn on the lights and TRY to find it.  Then work it in just right and hope you don't break off or wear out another cable connector.  CRAP!!!  Oh yeah, that's fun. NOT A PROBLEM WITH THIS COMPUTER-BUT A MICROSOFT - SOFTWARE PROBLEM Before purchasing this laptop, I bought a Dell from Wal-Mart.  I was setting it up and got to the point, where you have to put your Country & Birthdate.  I put in United States and it wouldn't let me enter my birthdate.  Whenever I tried, it would erase it, before I could click on NEXT.  I could not continue with set up.  After trying all kinds of birthdates and everything I could think of, I called Dell customer support.  I talked to 2 separate techs for the better part of an hour.  They told me to return it to Walmart or mail it in to them and it might be a few weeks, before I'd get it back.  I wasn't about to mail in a brand new computer for repairs. Fast forward a couple days and I purchased this computer on Amazon.  Guess what?  I got to the EXACT same place and I could NOT input my birthdate or any birthdate.  I called the toll free number included in the box for Amazon\/Acer Support.  After about 35 to 40 minutes of them trying everything, they agreed with me that this was a software issue and gave me Microsoft's phone number.  GAWD, if someone would have just done that to start with.  Called Microsoft and found out \"YUP\" it's in a LOT of computers.  She walked me through it and we set up the computer completely through Microsoft  I was probably on the phone with her about 50 minutes, but Hallelujah, everything was working and off & running.  Thank you Microsoft Lady!!! A COUPLE OTHER THINGS A touch screen would have been great, but this is a lower priced laptop, so I wasn't expecting one.  Since it's a 15.6\", it totes a full layout keyboard.  OK, I know a lot of people like the little 10\" & 14\" models, but I want at least a 15.6\" laptop.  Sure, I'd even like a 17\", but then you're jumping in price again. The trackpad isn't overly responsive, but I don't really use a trackpad much anyway. A backlit keyboard would REALLY be nice and my next laptop will definitely have that.  Again, not something usually found on a lower priced laptop. So, my Biggest Beefs are the \"Battery Does NOT Last Anywhere Near What Acer Claims.\"  \"The LAN Port is a JOKE.\"  \"Can't Blame Acer for the Software, that's on Microsoft-SHAME On YOU-Microsoft.\"  FIX THAT!!!  Acer is also not responsible for the problems with Windows 10.  \"Ahem-Microsoft?\"  Windows 10 has been around long enough, for these things to have been fixed.  Why aren't they?  Why do the buyers have to go in and fix everything? My advice is to go with another computer.  If you do purchase this, get it on sale, because you're going to have your share of headaches and you should at least save a few bucks. Thank you for reading my review and I apologize for being so long.","I did a tremendous amount of research before choosing this laptop and I definitely made the right choice. Right now it's the #1 laptop on Laptop.com for laptops under $500.  Powerful processor, 6 GB RAM, 1080p display, DVD drive, decent keyboard, outstanding battery life, smooth trackpad, 3 USB-3 and 1 USB-C port, wireless a\/c, HDMI, the list goes on and on. It has an integrated Intel graphics card so only light gaming is possible. The memory and hard drives are easy to get to for upgrades. The only negative is  the included 1 TB 5400 RPM hard drive. As a boot drive it is horrible and really holds the performance of this machine back. I had a spare 2.5\" 240 GB SanDisk Ultra SSD laying around and swapped it in for the boot drive and that made a huge difference. There is an M.2 slot but it is NOT NVMe so make sure to buy the right drive for that slot. You're definitely going to want to upgrade the boot drive. One other caveat is the entire laptop is black including the keyboard so trying to type in a low light setting is tough for hunt and peck typing.  A back-lit keyboard would've been nice.  All in all, a great value and I highly recommend this laptop.","There's a sticker on my laptop that says \"12 hrs Long battery life,\" this seems (too me) to be false advertising as the battery says 8+hrs while on battery saver mode and with the most conservative settings that I'm aware of.  The battery also did die well within 12 hrs of use after being fully charged. The layout of the HMDI and USB ports is terrible.  You cannot easily use all three ports at the same time, usually I can only use 2 out of 3 as these three ports are right next to each other and way too close. My HDMI plug is too wide and blocks me from using the USB port next to it. Since 2 of the USB ports are also right next to each other you can only use very slim adapters, such as a charger cables, you will have some difficulty with some USB drives as they're too wide. This just seems like very poor planning on the manufacturer and something that really really bothers me. UPDATE: Had this laptop for a few months now and it's already acting up even more than it was before. My touchpad is jumping and clicking on it's own and is basically unusable.  Also I was unaware that it also does not, does NOT have an Ethernet port, beware of that.","This is frankly the worst laptop I've ever owned. Sometimes upon opening my laptop and hitting the power button, nothing at all will happen. I try Ctrl alt del, I try esc, I try enter, I try hitting the power again - nothing. Sometimes it will show my desktop without icons or ability to login or a taskbar. Be I'll easily be there ten minutes trying to get it to let me sign in.  If I come back to it 20 min later, sometimes it's fine. When I am in the system, even having multiple tabs can be too much stress for it. But sometimes having multiple things open goes fine. There doesn't seem to be rhyme or rhythm, it just gets the extreme slow spells.  I'm really disappointed with my purchase. I gave it a long time as some reviewers said it was normal for it to be slow for a few months as Microsoft installs background programs, but this is bs. Don't listen to it. I'll go back to hp next time.","This laptop is pretty slow and run of the mill unless you take advantage of the easy to access M.2 SSD upgrade port. If you are even a little tech savvy, it is quite simple to upgrade this $400 laptop into one that can keep up with one triple the price. Just follow the below steps: 1. Get an M.2 SSD (Conveniently offered as a bundle) 2. Take off the battery, then the bottom plate and insert the SSD in the M.2 slot (look up a guide on YouTube if you need a demo, it's quite simple to add). Replace the plate and battery. 3. Turn on the laptop and go to Microsoft's website and follow the instructions to create a Windows 10 bootable USB. (This is a good preview of how the laptop would be without an SSD that will make you appreciate it all the more) 4. Once your USB is ready, shut down the machine, insert the USB in the 3.0 port and turn it back on. 5. Reinstall Windows 10 on the SSD, and format the old HDD. If it doesn't boot to the USB installer, you may need to restart and press the F12 (I think) key while it is powering on to get to the boot menu, and choose the USB to boot from. Voila! You now have a bloatware-free, 5-seconds-to-boot Windows 10 laptop with 1TB of additional storage that should run very well for the price. The only issue I have is the 6GB of included memory, which again can be easily upgraded.","There's nothing terrible about this machine, but nothing exceptional either. The display is probably it's worst feature, angle of view is very sensitive, and it's not particularly sharp either. On board speakers suck, but it's a laptop and I guess I shouldn't expect better, but they're on the bottom of the computer and very hard to hear if it's in your lap. I really hate Bing as a browser, I can't get rid of it, so every time I open a tab, it's a two step process to get to Google or another browser. I've searched how to get rid of it, and none of them works. Build quality is flimsy, but can't expect much more for a $300 range computer. The pluses, as far as wi-fi stability, it's good, programs run fast enough and I can run several applications at the same time. So speed is adequate for what I need it for. I paid <$300 on Prime Day, so price was right for the amount of machine you get. Would I pay >$300? No.","This laptop is starting to shut off constantly on its own.  I've had it for a couple of months and suddenly it started shutting off on its own.  There is no blockage to the battery and it sometimes get hot.  I hate it.  Contacted customer support where it was difficult to understand the person who was nice but the accent was a problem.  I  reset the computer to original settings 3 times and nothing fixes this.  I've owned a lot of computers but have never had these kinds of problems that don't seem to get fixed.  I feel like throwing it out the window -- my upstairs window.","When the laptop arrived it showed no signs of issue. Once trying to browse the internet no webpages would load. Laptop said it was connected but acted as if it wasn\u2019t. A non-tech savvy person would never figure this out but I uninstalled the network card drivers and it solved the issue. A frustrating issue to have STRAIGHT out of the box. I had ordered upgraded RAM, SSD, and IPS display, so far only installed the RAM as the others haven\u2019t arrived but the laptop is quite usable and quick. Boot up times are VERY long by today\u2019s standards which will be solved once the SSD is installed. The IPS display upgrade is to solve the TN screen that comes with the laptop. I bought it before receiving the laptop as I expected the screen to be much worse but in reality it\u2019s quite crisp and nice to look at. Unusable outside however and can glare pretty badly around windows but that\u2019s why the IPS upgrade is suggested. However sticking with the stock screen is easily going to be okay. The lack of backlighting on the keyboard is one of those things I didn\u2019t expect to miss until I tried to use my laptop at night. It\u2019s actually a bit annoying but it\u2019s part of the sacrifice at this price point. Lastly the plastic is fingerprint city. Any time I touch the computer a fingerprint appears and maybe it\u2019s because I spend a lot of time working on cars but I tend to not keep my hands very oily, and yet as you can see by my photo the prints are really bad leading me to wipe it down at least twice a day. It\u2019s annoying and ugly. Oh one more thing. The sticker that says \u201c12hrs battery life\u201d is a lie. I don\u2019t know if they are measuring that time with the computer in sleep mode but I get 6 hours on \u201cbattery saver\u201d mode. Soooo take that as you will. Still an insane little laptop for the price and comes at very high recommendations so long as you can drop the extra $100 over time to upgrade ram and SSD. Extra $60 on top of that for an IPS display and you have a very impressive low cost build.","I am usually an HP person when it comes to buying desktop and laptop computers. However, when my presence HP rapidly began to succumb to hardware failure, I found that I had to act fast or risk losing seven years of data.  So I looked around at several places and online stores until I stumbled upon this Acer Aspire E 15 at the end of the year sale section on Amazon, which has everything or more of what I was looking for in a laptop. As described it is a 15.6\" Full HD, 8th Gen Intel Core i3-8130U, 6GB RAM Memory, 1TB HDD, 8X DVD, E5-576. It also came with Windows 10 and not much else, which is fine with me as I like adding my own programs. I admit that I didn\u2019t know much about Acer product before buying this laptop, I truly like everything about it. As a university senior this is a great little computer for any student and the purchase will not break the bank. I recommend it to anyone looking for a new computer either for school, work, or streaming videos and playing games. This Acer Aspire E 15 is incredibly suitable for any job.","i researched laptops for months before buying one and thinking i would be receiving an awesome one for gaming without having to buy a gaming laptop, i guess you get what you pay for.  im so disappointed in this thing being too slow to even play my game on it or search anything on the internet. i dont even wanna put photos on it or anything for fear that it may quit turning on altogether.  i suggest you buy a different one.","Bought this as it could be delivered next day due to my Sager laptop took a fall and cracked screen. As I use my main  laptop for work stuff 90% of the time, and have a high end unit, this is a snail in comparison with having only a i3 processor. The i3 is good for basic no frills computing, but don't try to run multiple programs. For me it is a painful realization going from i7-4700  down to a i3 to fill in for a week till mine gets repaired, then ether give away or stick in closet if needed for emergency. I use win 7 pro, so using win 10 home is painful as it has to much crap and slows the system even more. Pros: looks nice, is light, very small brick, keyboard feel is very good. This is a great starter unit and  would be good for daily email and mild surfing. Not bad for $379, and with this, you do get what you pay for.","This computer for the money is a bargain, I found this computer here on amazon after reading reviews on the best under $400 laptop. I read the reviews on this computer and decided to give it a try, bought this computer plus a SSD harddrive night and day difference between the two hard drives. most reviewers recommend installing a SSD hardrive in this computer, so I ordered and SSD hardrive the same time I ordered this computer, both came in at the same time. This is the SSD I bought Crucial P1 1TB 3D NAND NVMe PCIe M.2 SSD Installing the SSD was straight forward, getting windows 10 to see the SSD harddrive wasn't. Had the use disc management tried different ways to get windows 10 copied over to SSD harddrive, what worked was installing the software the SSD hardrive manufacturer recommended. I know my bad, I tried several of these youtube videos, none of them worked, but Crucial software worked perfectly. the youtube videos recommend EaseUS, that is junk ware, never did work, failed every time then wanted money. Crucial recommends Acronis\u00ae True Image it worked flawlessly. Anyway great computer, I am very happy with this computer. Update, added 16 GB Ram. I upgraded the laptop for $137 plus taxes and computer runs great. Ram for this laptop only $42 for 16 GB well worth the cost.

It runs sufficiently (for my purposes) and every program I need to use (Paint Tool SAI, GIMP, Photoshop) or game I enjoy playing (Skyrim and Sims 3 mostly) operates without issue. The webcam is very poor quality. I don't ever use it so it doesn't bother me too much, but I removed a star as a lot of people want a decently-working cam. Battery life is strong, but nothing crazy remarkable. Screen resolution is fine. Overall the quality vs the price (at the time I bought this it was at 350$) is more than fair. I've had this thing for 5 months and have had no problems. (I included a random picture I sent to my boyfriend of a sculpture to show the picture quality for the webcam cuz I don't have any other examples lol)","This is the slowest PC I've ever seen in 25 years of using them.  It is so painfully slow that I wanted to install an SSD.  First step is to remove the battery, right?  Should be covered in the user manual, right? WRONG!!  and absolutely nothing available on the internet for this model either.  OK, so I contacted Acer support, and that's where I learned how really stupid I was to ever buy an Acer product.  Even after I provided all details (model number, serial number, etc) they refused to answer the basic question of how to remove the battery unless I gave them my address, my email address, my cell phone number, my social security number, and the names and addresses of all of my children, grandchildren, and business associates (and that is only a slight exaggeration).  Never again, Acer.  and please stop calling your lack of response \"customer support\" -- it is nothing of the kind.","Just got the laptop and finished upgrading and configuring it. - I added new RAMS 8GB*2 = 16GB total - I added a 250 GB SSD drive and boot windows from it You can follow the upgrade method already detailed by another user on the following link: https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/customer-reviews\/RBWDC9C7GKBVG\/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B079TGL2BZ ( PS: To create bootable windows 10 usb drive here is a youtube video for you https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qbglcmAh0h4 ) In my case I used: - WD SSD 250GB.

Check https:\/\/www.amazon.ca\/gp\/product\/B0145WDNF2\/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Judgement: ========== With this minor memory upgrade + using the SSD drive as the main drive on which windows in installed + Installing windows without bloatware by creating a bootable windows 10 MEDIA USB --> The laptop is pretty fast now. It boots to window login screen in less than 5 seconds. Good performance for all kind of work (PS haven't test Gaming). Really good output for the cost. I like it, might buy another one.","I don't think there will be any better computer for the price that this one has... The value to cost is a done deal... I purchased this computer in hopes that it would run light games... Like rocket league e.c.t... The pc runs RL on 1366x768 with low settings at about 60-70fps...great fps for the price of the pc... The one down fall it has for gaming is the ddr3... The previous generation had ddr4 and because of that the integrated graphics ran a little faster... Thus producing better gaming performance... This isnt the best gaming pc out there... But for 380$ and light games... It works... I would totally recommend if you want a laptop to just have some fun with csgo and other light games or if you wana do a little bit if editing the i3-8130u is more than capable with its high boost speed... Great laptop for the price I will be buying another one for my brother soon... Btw good to add a ssd and ram","Absolute piece of junk. Right out of the box into the ridiculous world of Windows 10. This is the least friendly operating system ever. Well that's not bad enough, finally was able to navigate certain functions then I went to dinner. When I came back the machine was blank. When I finally got it going, it had a message on the screen, no bootable device Called \"special\" Acer \/Amazon customer support who decided that I can send it to God knows where for a repair. Absolutely not, I am returning in less than 24 hours from receiving delivery from Amazon. One of the biggest pieces of garbage and Amazon should be ashamed to associating with such a garbage company. Go to a brick and mortar store where the electronics you buywill last longer than a day.","Similar to but much updated from my Toshiba laptop.  Speakers are on the order of 300% better.  Clear, loud and better bass (for a laptop). 8th Generation CPU and Intel UHD Graphics (1080p) make a statement.  Price!!!!!!! Would not hesitate to recommend.","After getting used to this new laptop, trying a variety of tasks and of course playing my games I definitively approve.  I specifically did not want a touchscreen.  Fast startup and smooth running programs.  Easily syncing of my accounts (email, e.t.c) I have been able to basically pick right up.  I'm thoroughly pleased with my purchase especially after comparison shopping in store.  Twice the storage alone plus an extra 2G RAM for better gaming and this was a no brainer. I don't recommend playing games without being plugged in otherwise great battery","First, specs claim 16gb DDR3L ram, only has 6gb ram. The display is far less than expected with the claimed resolution. Second unable to fulling install HP all in one laser printer, keep getting \"get Administrator error\". Called Acer Tech Service, what a joke , they claim they do not have anything about this issue, so could not help with the issue and hung up for the next call or complaint, so it seems Acer also has poor Tech Support Service. Contacted HP, they informed Acer is aware of an issue with their added files to the OS creating this issue, so it turns out Acer was not truthful when I called. Was going to return these lesser than expected quality Acer notebooks, then decided since will be using a connected HP HDMI display most of the time, would keep them for a pass down unit in a few years. In the end would not purchase an Acer product again.","I agree with others who said that the display is a little washed out. While it doesn't have a great display it otherwise performs very well for an inexpensive laptop. This was a gift for my grandson and he's quite happy with it so that's all that counts.","I gave it 5 stars because it met my expectations in every way.  The product was not packed compactly and I was afraid I would have an issue with it.  But it started right up and has been working well.  The long-life battery is a plus for me, because I can be more mobile with it.  So far the battery has given me  up to 8 hours without having to recharge.  I was already familiar with the Windows10, so that was also a plus.  It had a trial of Norton's protection which I didn't keep, because I already had another but discovered that I really like the Norton's virus protection.  It's just expensive.  The DVD write\/player works well because I still have storage on some.  I've been using the laptop for two months now, and continue to be fully satisfied with this purchase.","The performance from this laptop is not actually bad, making it an excellent value. The construction is not particularly rugged, but as long as you pick it up with both hands, never by the screen, and use a cushioned backpack when transporting it, you should be fine. This does have two weak spots. The first is the RAM. Some versions come with just 4GB of ram, 2 of which will go to video. You will absolutely want to add an additional 4GB of ram - it will make a tremendous difference in performance across the range. The second is the power adapter. It is the cheapest adapter Acer could have paired with it. It can struggle to both run the laptop and charge the battery at the same time, and there are high failure rates. This is true whether you have the Acer branded adapter or the Lite-On branded adapter. Across internet forums, people have been pulling their hair out thinking it was the internal battery going bad, the ACPI drivers being corrupted, or even the power port (which gets loose). I recommend that you purchase the PWR+ 053-PWR57-54713 here on Amazon should you have any problems with charging, including long charge times. Most definitely if you get the battery (orange) LED blinking, and the laptop refusing to power up. https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00G74W588\/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1","If you are looking for an ultra light gaming rig this is not your computer. My priorities are quiet,high quality components,easy to upgrade,long battery life,good connectivity. This laptop delivers on these big time. The 2 things that would improve it for me would be detachable battery so when its used as a non-mobile secondary desktop the battery life could be extended by not using it. As others have mentioned the display quality is particularly sensitve in the vertical axis. You get pretty good color and contrast if you keep the lid bent a bit further back. I upgraded the memory to 8GB and the  hard drive to a 256GB ssd for windows 10 and installed a M.2 128GB sata ssd for linux mint. The battery life is about 7-8 hours with light browsing and general use. The battery identifies itself as a 62 Wh (usable 55Wh) Panasonic AS16B5j The idle power usage is around 7 watts unless you have the display at very bright settings. Setting the upper cpu speed to 1200MHZ the computer uses 10.4 watts and at 2200MHz uses 14.8 watts running N-Queens multithreaded bench mark.  At 73 ambient temp,the idle cpu temp is 33-34 deg C and when running the N_Queens bench mark at 1200MHZ the temp was 38-39 and at 2200MHZ the temp was 45-48. So it is a very cool running laptop. The display brightness in linux can be adjusted from 2 lux to 200 lux. The keyboard is quite good and the advance multi-finger touch pad is the best touch pad I have ever used, especially for navigating the screen..who needs a touch screen? I have only had it a few days but for now, I think I am smitten..","I purchased this computer to replace my other Acer laptop that after years of use died a slow and painful death. Cosmetics:  I am female.  I like computers that come in different colors.  Yes, I know.  How stupid, but that's me.  So having this in other colors would be a plus.  But I'll live. The nitty gritty.  I do NOT like Windows 10.  With that said, it took me a while to figure out.  You don't get an owner's manual like you did in years gone by.  It's pretty much plug it in and hope for the best.  The screen resolution is good.  I'm glad it has an easily accessible way to turn down the screen brightness as it's a little too bright for me on the normal setting.  Not a problem turning it down. The speakers are adequate for what I use this laptop for.  I mainly listen to gospel music and such, and I'm not a gamer so I don't need my computer table to be shaking from the bass nor do I need to hear guns blazing so loud that I fear for my life. The keyboard is standard with a good feel\/touch to it. The touch pad.  I HATE IT.  The right\/left click is built into the touch pad.  The are not separate buttons\/keys.  When you least expect it, you will find yourself scrolling like a manic pumped up on sugar.  Come on Acer!  The touch pad doesn't need to look sleek.  It needs to be functional. All in all, I like the computer.  I've hooked up a mouse so that I can get away from the touch pad from hell which seems to have a mind of it's own.","I have been researching budget laptops for a couple months now and I finally pulled the trigger on the Acer Aspire 15 as an alternative to a couple of Acer Chromebooks that are no longer compatible with my job. I ordered it with the WD 250GB SSD and have been doing some Youtube edu to figure out how to make a boot drive with a USB stick, how to install the m.2 SSD, and how to operate the BIOS page to set up the boot drive. I have to say, not only is the computer running great  but I honestly had a lot of fun learning about how this computer operates and tinkering with the hardware\/software. I have had a great experience with my last two Acer Chromebooks and I am glad I decided to stick with them despite this unit having a lot of negative reviews. Even before the upgrade the computer still worked just fine, having the extra storage and speed is just the cherry on top. The one negative I will mention is the screen. It's not necessarily the picture itself (with the upgraded SSD it runs 4K youtube videos beautifully), but just the feel of it. It bends and flexes far more then I am comfortable with. For that reason it will be parked on my desk full time with my Chromebooks making trips out of the house. 100% would recommend this laptop especially when upgraded!!!! Edit - Upon further review I discovered the windows doesn't come with software to play DVDs! Which is strange considering the disc drive it boasts. Also, other's complained about the AC adapter connection and I agree that it is pretty awful. For some reason you have to really fidget with it to find the right insertion angle. I am worried that I will break it one day.","my Aspire e15 is full of bugs and problems. My screen brightness control disappeared one day and after much tech support,they got it back,but immediately thereafter every time i close the lid it goes in to hibernation and cant be woken up,even though i have it set to do nothing when i close the lid. Tech support numerous calls,they dont know what or why,i have to send the unit in. The front lights on mine shine purple,when they should be blue or orange, again tech support doesn't know why,send it in. Acer tech support is the worst. They are outsourced  to a third party company out of country and the have the attitude and just dont care....The sound quality of recordings are terrible,the mic doesn't work correctly and you need a special mic to plug into line in for it to use a different mic than the built in which sucks. Many additional bugs,I could go on and on,but i regret buying this Acer product and would not ever buy Acer again.","Amazing machine!  I purchased this after much research and I have to say I am very impressed!  Snappy response time compared to the old Toshiba that failed on me.  Camera picture quality is a little on the grainy side but everything else seems top-notch!  Great purchase!","I started the laptop up right when I got it to get a sense of out-of-the-box speed and the state of the Windows 10 OS.  Not great on either front, as you'd expect. After doing that, I put in a SSD and did a clean install of Windows 10 on it (also re-formatted the 1TB HDD it came with to wipe it).  Access to the hard drives and RAM is quite convenient and easy to swap out.  Following the clean install, the laptop loads extremely quickly, and it runs multiple applications without issue, even running less-graphic-intensive games fine. I didn't do anything with the RAM at this point, leaving the 6 GB that came with it, although I may look at replacing that in the future, especially if I do anything more than the light gaming I've tried so far.  To be clear, I don't foresee this being a laptop that facilitates much heavy gaming, but if you were to bump up to 16 GB of RAM, I'm sure it'd get at least marginally better for that as well. This laptop coupled with the SSD still came in under $400, so I'm happy with that for what I'm getting.","This laptop has met my expectations for work.  It's a little heavier than I was hoping for but it has a CD\/DVD drive which seems to be obsolete in most laptops.  It's fast and picture quality is there.  I have 10 year Acer laptops still working and desktops at home.  For the average user, this meets the bill.  Couldn't beat the price of $329.","The laptop is good for daily use. It is a bit slow but I am going to disregard that as a factor in this review. My only problem is that occasionally when I suspend or lock the laptop or even leave it idle and the screen goes black, it does not come back on. I'm not sure if the system hangs or that there is some issue with the screen. To test this I installed Fedora (dual boot) to see if it happens on Fedora as well and it did. So I'm sure that the problem is not with any software, OS or drivers. To recover from this, I just have to do a hard reboot (on both Windows and Linux). And this is a pain as I am sometimes in the middle of work. The laptop build quality is as can be expected from a cheap laptop. My main problem with this laptop is with its reliability. In terms of the screen, it is thoroughly unreliable.","I purchased this Acer laptop  recently. I have only been using it about 10 days now but so far so good. I am new to Windows 10 and can't say I'm a huge fan but I know I will get used to it with time.  I love having the DVD-R drive. These are increasingly hard to find on laptops. Video on this Acer is sharp and sound is nice and clear from the speakers. The colors and \"themes\" are nice as well. I like that I can customize colors, etc. Battery life is good as well. I don't like that the number keypad cuts itself off every time I restart the computer or close the lid. There may be a way to change that in the settings. I am still learning new things each time I'm on the laptop. Will update this review after more time has passed."],"15":["I went into this purchase a little nervous. My other tablet\/laptop hybrid experiences had been bad. But I can honestly say this is perfect for my needs.  It is very good for annotating PDF files and the pen is more responsive than I expected. It is a little heavy to be used one handed, but it's large enough to brace against your body. I've gotten more arm strain from much smaller lighter devices. As a laptop the keyboard is well sized and easy to type on. All the keys are well placed. My only complaint is that there is no 10 key on the side, but with this size that wouldn't be possible. Battery life is decent, probably 4-8 hours. It multitasks well, I've watched videos with multitab chrome running in the background. Speaking of chrome, it runs great until you get about 12-15 tabs up. Then it get's a little slooooow. The touch screen is as responsive and a flagship smart phone. And I've had no trouble with my wifi connecting at all. I haven't tried any games yet, because I'm assuming it won't have the power. I'll update if I try.","First of, the laptop I received had a battery defect so I requested for a replacement the very next day I got it. I received the replacement after 2 days and I fell in love with the features especially with the price. I only use it for the basic stuff and it isn't that fast but I'm fine with it. But after 2 weeks of use, one of the hinges became misaligned rendering it unable to be closed without breaking it. I wasn't being careless or anything, I was just closing it like I usually do and I just heard a something crack all of a sudden. I am very disappointed with the quality of this one. It's hinges are supposed to be one of the strongest parts since it transforms into a tablet. I just hope I'll be able to return this and I will definitely get a more pricey one. Just waiting for asus to respond to my email.","Replaced an older Asus netbook with this. This is a very nice laptop for general use. Switched to Win 10 Pro from S right away. It took about 2.5 hours to complete. It had 38 GB free on the HD while in S mode, but after switching to Pro, it only has 13 GB free. I tested the latest release of Ubuntu (18.04) on it and it runs well. Everything works. The only negative thing I can say about this laptop is the lack of storage space after switching to Pro, but that is because Windows 10 is so bloated. Edit: Ran the disk clean up and told it to delete previous windows installations. I now have 33 GB free space.","I love this thing, but I hate this thing! Talkin bout a love hate relationship! The Pro's: SUPER SLIM. Battery life. Speakers loud for size of laptop. Quick, processor for everyday use. Fingerprint scanner for log-in. Feels high quality. a little flexible tho. Cheap price! ~$350ish. Etc, etc, etc. CONS: Only 64GB of storage. (about 32GB usable) Storage is cheap now days, WTH!? No regular USB port (3.1 or anything). Only ONE USB C port. Full size SD card reader that leaves 3\/4's of the card sticking out! They could have put a micro SD card reader in it, and made it not stick out. My whole plan was to use a large SD card as the main storage since the onboard storage is only 64GB total. Luckily they make small micro SD card adapters that fit into full size SD card ports. (search Amazon). I bought one made for the Raspberry Pi. (yet to arrive) It has a female micro USB port!?!? What in the world?! I have never seen ANYTHING use a micro to micro USB cable! Guess I'll have to get on off here. SMH! Etc, etc, etc. I've already submitted to return this thing, but I love it, not sure what I'm going to do yet... LOL","I'm very impressed with this 2 in 1 laptop. I have been using it daily for 2 weeks now and have had no problems at all. It's light and sturdy and the hindges are very good. I work on the go 5 days a week with children. This laptop has made keeping up with paperwork a breeze and I also let the kids use it for educational games and apps. I also enjoy drawing so the pen is definitely a plus and feels natural when drawing. I recommend this laptop to everyone.","Pros:  The screen resolution is 1920\/1080.  The unit is really lightweight.  I don't perceive any speed problems. It came with the touch pen, which works.  Battery life, so far, is 4-6 hours.  No area of the laptop gets warm, let alone hot.  For less than $350, this is a very good value. Cons:  My upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, took 1 hour and 12 minutes with Microsoft's Technical Assistance, (Free). I had searched for an Asus model with a finger touch ID, and thought this had one.  No luck. You will need a \"C\" Male to USB3 female adaptor for USB3 service. It is true, the connectors, (All are on the left or right side of the keyboard) extend 1\/2 to 1 & 1\/2\" beyond the keyboard, requiring care in handling of the laptop.","I had this flipbook just over a month and now after 2 to 5 minutes it shuts down automatically.  Battery life is full and happens whether plugged in or not. It is not overheating.  I have not downloaded any software.  I used it less than probably 20 hours total.  I contacted Amazon support chat (over a month ago) and that seemed as though my problems would be resolved.  I was assured I would get a hone call from ASUS the following day at 4pm my time.  I actually inquired to be sure the phone call was in my time zone.  I waited until after 6pm just in case it was PST and never received a call. I work 6 days a week, long hours.  I have not had time to revisit the issue but am exgtremely disappointed in not only not being able to use my laptop, but that CS has made no effort to contact me to resolve the issue. At this point I will not ever buy ASUS again and will tell anyone shopping for a a laptop, flipbook etc. to go with a different brand.","i really like this laptop. it does have cons like not having a cd\/dvd player, and not having a type A usb port, but it overall works very well. ive had it for a few months and have not had any problems","Bought this 2in1 for my mom, she absolutely loves it. Very few complaints in the first 2 months. If there was one thing she could add, it would be a second camera. It's a little difficult to take pics with the rear facing camera (unless you're taking a selfie), but that's not a deal-breaker. Also, she was upgrading from an Android ASUS, so she didn't have access to the apps she had been using. To remedy this, we unstalled an Android emulator on this system. Now she has all of her old Android apps, along with the new Windows apps.","So far, this laptop has been a great purchase for the money. I don't often write reviews but upon reading some of the negative ones on this particular product, I was inspired to leave one. First off, a lot of people are complaining about the limited app store that you are forced to utilize while in Windows S mode. However it's super easy to change to regular Windows. The first thing I do immediately when using a new computer is download Chrome. With this computer, I just had to go through the motions of downloading Chrome, it told me I couldn't while in S mode and asked if I wanted to switch, I clicked \"yes\" and boom, regular Windows, no problem. It is correct that there are no regular old USB ports on this. However, I bought a $6 adapter and it's no big deal. I don't plug too many USB things into it anyway (it has bluetooth, so you can easily get a bluetooth mouse and bluetooth headphones), but the adapter is so cheap that I picked it up anyway just in case I ever should need it for a flash drive or whatnot. Some people talk about a pen. I'm not sure why. Mine did not come with a pen. But that wasn't a big deal either. I was able to get a Microsoft certified pen for $30 on Amazon that works perfectly with it (not a stylus, a true connective pen). The lack of a slot for a pen is a little inconvenient, but I purchased a pen clip that attaches to the side of the laptop (also very cheap) and problem solved. The processor could be better, it's a little laggy with too many Chrome tabs open, but for the price I can't complain. Overall, it needed a few tweaks (like the adapter, pen, and pen attachment) but it was worth it for the low price, lightweight machine, and great battery life. I've been a lifelong user of Asus products and while I have been disappointed in the more recent low reviews of their computers, I wasn't able to stray away to a different company, and once again I am not disappointed.","I purchased a computer and found that it has apparently had the Windows 10  \"key\" already used.  I received the error \"We can't activate Windows on this device because the product key was already used on another device...\"  UNBELIEVABLE that you would sell a computer in this condition!  I tried to get it replaced but was told that you cannot replace it because it was a \"renewed\" computer.  Wow.  Renewed??  Really? So I get the runaround. Called Amazon support, they can't help... they sent me to Asus, they can't help, they say someone from higher tier will call back, they don't.  I call them back.  They say they will send me the original Key in 24-48 \"business hours\" (this is now Thursday, so... by Monday).  Looks like on the Activation page there is NOWAY for me to enter the original key, but... oh well, I'll wait. Amazon could simply send me another computer... But I guess that would break them. STEER CLEAR!!!","My mistake, I didn't find other user complaints about this same issue buried among other, higher reviews on this \"Amazon's Choice\" tablet.  But any of us accustomed to the micro-SD slot on other tablets (including modern Kindle Fire tablets) or phones will be shocked at how awful the \"card reader\" slot on this device.  It appears as if the designers NEVER want a memory card left in the slot for longer than it takes to upload or download a few files. First designer \/ user mis-match, the SD slot takes the old-style full size (postage stamp sized) SD Card.  I would have (and think most users would) expect the micro-SD (fingernail sized) card. Second, the full sized card only inserts into the slot about 1\/4th its length.  It leaves about an inch of plastic waving around outside the edge of the device -- catching on clothing, other paperwork, etc.  Obviously the card can't be left in the slot when the tablet is put away in a sleeve for transport; it would break right off, probably damaging the slot. Third, the card doesn't ever \"catch\" or hook into any sort of spring-like mechanism.  Most tablets do have a sort of tactile \"feel\" when the card seats into the slot correctly, and the catch also holds the card from getting unseated when the device is shaken.  Some devices with the full sized SD Card slot even have a rubberized cover over the opening.  This tablet takes a card, partway in, and you can push as hard as you dare without ever knowing whether it's engaged properly or not -- and you can tug it out accidentally with no indication you're doing so. Fourth, it's just annoying that all the other slots are micro modern.  HDMI, USB, etc.  All micro.  Why the inconsistancy\/ Fifth, the slot is rated to take VERY LARGE  SD memory cards -- the kind I expected to use as sort of a \"hard drive\" to store the photos the tablet would be recording and editing.  This is inconsistent with the \"Card Reader\" description and the bad mounting design that seems to suggest the designers only wanted users to move a few files from separate camera, into the VERY SMALL on-board memory, then remove the SD card.  With this SD card slot out of the picture, there is no way to upgrade user-storage capacity, as with a hard drive or on-board SSD drive.  So, why bother installing and rating for large capacity SD cards?  Misleading. I'm not particularly thrilled with the \"Windows 10 (R)estricted  Operating system, either. Yes, it's a fine touchscreen. Very light weight.  Seems to hold a charge on the battery.  But  NOT what I needed or wanted or expected.  I'm very disappointed in ASUS for designing this terrible tablet, and I'm astonished that Amazon publicizes it as a \"user's choice\".  What are those users actually doing with it?","I was so excited to get this. When I did, something was off about it. Some of the settings didn\u2019t work. So, I send it back for another. I received it on good time. However,  the same thing was wrong. I didn\u2019t want another and amazon doesn\u2019t exchange items for anything unless it\u2019s the same item. So keep this in mind. I didn\u2019t feel like going through the whole return, wait for refund thing. So I\u2019m  stuck with an item that settings don\u2019t work  my best advice to you is go out to a store start buying your stuff at a store because if you decide that you don\u2019t want it or it is broke you can\u2019t exchange it for any other item but the identical item which in my opinion kind of sucks","IMPORTANT Wrong details on this product... this product does NOT allow you to upgrade two Windows 10 home or Pro for free, you can only upgrade to Pro at a cost of $99. I even called Asus  to verify and they said I should have to contact Amazon or Windows for any upgrades, and Amazon does not offer the upgrade from them and windows of course it's not going to give it to you for free.","I purchased this and set it up for my friend's granddaughter. I'm also a PC building enthusiast that does IT work for a living. Right out of the box this thing impressed me. Very responsive and the right balance of hardware to perform really well for more than just average use. I'm really happy to see that it also includes USB Type C for connectivity. Just a heads-up before buying this though. It does not have old style USB Type A connections on it. You will need an adapter, hub, or just buy new peripherals with a USB Type C connector. For me it's not a big deal, because I already have upgraded most of my personal gear. For those unsuspecting buyers it may be a small annoyance when you first start to use it. Especially if you have a USB mouse that you plan on using. With the Bluetooth connectivity I simply paired my mouse and it works great. The same can obviously be done with other Bluetooth devices. This is just where the tech industry is headed with it's technology. You might as well suck it up now. I can't say anything negative about this laptop and I'm considering buying one for myself after spending a few days with it before giving it to my friend. The battery life was impressive and it's really pretty fast for what it is. It would be perfect for me to take on job sites and ditch the 15.6\" laptop I have now.","Even though this is still under warranty, ASUS wants me to pay shipping while my daughter is without her laptop for college for at least 2 weeks on a product that is 2 1\/2 months old. They kept telling me to back up my data?! On a laptop that won't turn on. Good plan. This will absolutely be the last ASUS product I'll buy, if for nothing else than the lousy support.","Its been 6 month since I purchased this Azus Vivobook flip laptop and already started having issues. The laptop screen suddenly went blank but the white bulb is still ON. I pressed the power button for more than 1 min at least 3 times but no change in status. I am unable to restart and blank screen continues. Unable to find the help or customer support so far to resolve this problem.","STUPID WINDOWS \"S MODE\"  THIS IS NOT RUNNING WINDOWS HOME, OR WINDOWS PRO, IT'S RUNNING AN OPERATING SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO INSTALL ANYTHING THAT IS NOT IN THE MICROSOFT STORE!!  WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP","Having some issues. I cant activate the windows 10 coz it says the product key has been used by another device, had reached the asus manufacturer and told me  to wait for the activation key they gonna send through email, I have waited but I didn't receive any. Upon reading the specs this laptop should have windows 10s and can be upgraded into Pro for free, and now I cant Use any shit in my laptop coz I cant activate it! Probably need a new one.PLUS I just noticed that it has missing 2 bolts at the back!! I know it's used but it's just too much for the price.","I just purchased this computer due to the fact that Asus had responded to a question in the question and answer section for this product here on amazon.  The question was \"is the ssd upgradeable\".  The Asus employee stated that a M.2 drive had to be purchased.  So based on this, I purchased a 256 gig M.2 drive.  I pulled the back cover and saw an empty M.2 slot.  I secured the drive.  once I powered up, it did not recognize the drive.  I had purchased an external enclosure so I could copy the drive..  I went ahead and pugged the drive into the usb port and it was recognized!!  Since I knew the drive was good, I called Asus.  After the rep did some research, I was told that this model was not upgradable!! I noticed that a couple of reviewers stated that they were able to upgrade successfully upgrade..  it looks like they may have changed the specs..  my computer was manufactured on February 2019.","These machines just don't hold up to office work. The ones we ordered are dying left and right and are less than 3 months old. If they were stiffer maybe they would last longer, but the flex in the main body of the thing seems to be resulting in them wearing down very quickly and experiencing freezing issues. This behavior has been consistent in 4 of 5 machines ordered.","I use this for checking emails and light web browsing.  I upgraded the SSD to 250 GB (easy to do).  It's rock solid, has a decent display for the money.  It's definitely not a workhorse, but for $350, it's not supposed to be.  The touch screen isn't bad, good for quick sketches, but I would not use it for detailed work.","I bought this laptop because I'm going to college soon and I needed a laptop for class. I thought that the specs were good enough for the types of stuff I'll be doing, college essays, homework, bingeing netflix shows. And I like that it isn't very bulky and too heavy. However the performance is surprisingly bad, even with the specs it comes with. Google Chrome loads very slowly and tends to freeze a lot. Watching stuff online like youtube and netflix buffer a lot and can get annoying when it stops every few seconds. And I know Chrome can be heavy on CPU and RAM but I noticed it was a lot of background applications that were hogging all the speed so unless this is a bug its something to look out for. Overall good laptop but if doing stuff that shouldn't be performance consuming is a problem then I would look to finding a laptop that has higher spec ratings than this one.","Can\u2019t use google chrome or anything other than a limited amount of apps. Every time I plug in headphones I hear sound coming from both the computer and the headphones. I tried downloading chrome (properly I didn\u2019t do anything sketchy) and I get a pop up every five minutes telling me I can only use apps from their very limited Microsoft App Store. Don\u2019t buy this computer, it\u2019s a waste of money and I regret owning it every second that I use it.","I got this laptop for my online college and it works great. The mousepad allows for all functions (like right-click w 2-fingers or clicking the lower right button, it allows for double-tap, 1-click or left-button to select). I like the big screeb and the ability to flip it into tablet mode. The pen is really nice when I'm ready to take a break and do some adult coloring. And it's super light weight. I'm loving it! This is a great machine for the price... But if you are looking for something to do gaming or heavy-lifting dont expect this to do the trick.","This laptop has been such a disappointment. Not only was it a pain in the neck to set up and I still have not gotten through all of the setup. However, the setup is the least of my concerns. By the third week and only 4 uses this laptop just stopped turning on no power at all and the batter was fully charged. I thought the resolution would be pretty straight forward and quick however 2 months later I still have a non working brand new laptop sitting in my room. I am extremely disappointed. Update....sent it back for repair a month ago, I still have not gotten it back. I am totally shocked, I never thought something like this was remotely possible with an Amazon purchase. I don't even want it back at this point. I would rather have my money back! Such a disappointment!","Exceeded my expectations, once I figured out how to turn Windows 10 Home S into Windows 10 Home without buying the Windows 10 Pro upgrade. I love the light weight, decent performance, very long battery life. I find that I'm using it more and more in place of my heavy duty laptop. It runs all of my Microsoft Office 2016 Pro apps perfectly too. Finally a true laptop that you can use in your lap comfortably. The display is good, but not great. No touch screen issues and overall quality is very good. Best of all, you can't beat the price.","The plastic feeling and the low resolution.. I don't care for those qualities but other than that I'm Sad I had to return it and get the money back, I loved it and always wanted but never had.. But with the Tropical storm Dorian coming we need everything that we can afford that means taking stuff back for supplies love the products though .. Thanks U","Liked everything except it wont hold a WiFi connection and by the time I found this out it was past the return window.  Not worth the chance!  I will give it to my 3 year old grandson, I'm sure he will find something to do with it.  Maybe dig in the sand or smash with a bat.","I've had it for 7 months now. Never had a issue with it. I upgraded to windows 10 pro for free which I prefer.  Its convenient to carry and light but sturdy NOT flimsy and does NOT have that cheap feel to it. LOVE IT!  Best buy for the money.","This laptop is exactly what I wanted. Fast, easy to set up and most of all very light weight. I am 70yrs old with arthritis in my hands so transporting this laptop is a breeze. Plus the touchscreen makes it so much easier for me","Computer seems to work great but why does it not come with a USB drive?! It comes with a small adapter but seriously?! Who wants to try and keep track of a small adapter all the time and deal with plugging that in and out.. and only ONE port!! so dumb.  Wouldn't buy it again just for that reason.","Just make sure that you get a micro hdmi cable so you can use external monitors.","i cant just make review i have to use for atleast 1 month than i can tell you exactly how it is but dor now i am enjoying its light weight edge to edge display flat cute keybourd look is just awesome everyone liked it whoever saw in my friends. but i cant tell you about performance i have to wait and use. hope for the best.","Returned. No usb port. Comes with adapter but huge inconvenience to always use adapter for wireless mouse or flash drive.","I only just got this computer today, but I love it! I do wish it had a regular USB port but, I knew that going in. The only problem I have had so far is I closed the computer and the screen would not come on so I had to turn it off and back on but after that it was fine. I really love how lightweight the computer is and the size is just perfect. My previous computer was a 2010\/11 model MacBook Pro and I find that the dimensions and appearance are very similar, just now sleeker and thinner. I didn't think I would use the tablet function much on this computer but after testing it out today I may have to play around with it more. I saw several negative reviews about this machine and I don't see why, other than perhaps those people just got a bad egg. I would most definitely recommend this computer to students and anyone who needs a lightweight computer on the go or something easy for personal use. Maybe not for someone who needs their computer to do tons of heavy lifting, as it is not meant for that. All in all, I am really happy I bought this computer, I will check in if my opinion changes.","Super bargain","I am pleasantly surprised that an inexpensive computer like this one is so nice. I just ordered a second one because my daughter liked mine better then her MacBook and took it from me. I highly recommend this one, you get a lot for your money.","I really wanted a smaller lap top but this is light enough and a great buy for the price,I love it and the touch screen is a plus good color and sound","My husband's computer. Only complaint so far is that he needed to get a USB hub since there's a shortage of outlets on the computer.","It was a gift,  but I did the setup, seems very good for the price, I expect good service as I own an older Asus and it has been great.","I use this product for college and I love it! I really love how lightweight it is and how it doubles as a tablet","Best affordable laptop for my dad. The touchscreen and flip make this a really cool laptop especially for the price - you can't find anything comparable for under 600. It has a really sleek design that stand out, overall a great ASUS product as usual.","I just got my laptop in today, and I have to say that so far, I love it! The touch screen is super sensitive and I don't have to press hard to get it to cooperate. It is fast and setting it up was easy! Just did what it told me to do and voila! Super happy I made this purchase and you will be too! Side note, I don't know how well the battery lasts just yet but when I have had it for a while I will update.","I like it.","Purchased this laptop for my daughter to use at college.  She\u2019s very happy with the performance, weight, and battery life.","I bought my laptop in March of this year.  It really has been used much, and a couple of days ago I was watching a movie on it and the screen black.  It took a good hour before I could finally get it to come back up, it did that several times that day.  The next day I was checking email, and it started making a god awful noise and went black again!  Not sure what is going on with it.","Love this laptop!!! Works well and was easy to set up. Great size to move around and even use on your lap.","Great laptop. Holds a charge. Like for days. I\u2019m impressed. This is the perfect laptop for daily use.","i like how light it is. its super sleek and nice looking. i dont like how there is no cd player and no usb port. i didnt know that it didnt include those features. i also don't know if you can extend the one year warrany it comes with.","I just received this second-hand computer, which is ultra-thin, ultra-light, touch screen is very smart, the processor is fast, and the most important thing is that the price is very reasonable.","No complaints!","It is a slow dog. It gets hot. And it has HORRIBLE SPEAKERS\/AUDIO! I dont recommend it.","Seems fast and light. Easy to switch to Windows 10 Home mode.","If you need a device w\/RJ-45 connection...this isn't it. Otherwise, nice machine","Love it my son tried to talk me out of touch screen but I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t listen . Screen bigger than I thought love how cornea talks to you didn\u2019t know that was a  feature !!","Excelente","Overall, I love it.  However,  it is not able to download some apps that I would like, especially Kindle for computer so that I can use it as a tablet sometimes to read my books.  Update to follow if I figure out how.","Item as described. Good for a student. light weight and well built. Storage 64G is tight.","Love it","Bought for my Daughter and she loves it.","Excellent Value. Does everything you need for school for a great price. Couldn't be happier.","Portable, light and powerful.  Really enjoy the vivobook flip!","Real good","Absolutely love this laptop!! It\u2019s so easy to transport to school everyday the only downfall is the battery life. If I barely use it I still need to charge it every night or else it will be dead when I\u2019m going to use it the next day.","I like almost everything about this laptop, touch screen is great and capabilities are as advertised.  Only dislike is how little disk space storage there is so investing in an external hard drive might be beneficial.  All in all, great product and very pleased.","Performance and price are balanced","Great Product, Great service","Just received it.....im excited to use it!!","Great deal for this laptop! No issues so far and easy to use.","Didn't know what to expect with this laptop....its great!

Not disappointed one bit.","Easy to use and efficient right out of the box. Very nice design. Great Device !","It seems to be a nice machine. I wouldn't buy this due to the flash drive is so small and it keeps trying update and there is no room for the update. You can't stop the updates from downloading. I needed this to take exams on-line so I figured the small drive would be ok. But I was wrong. Don't buy this or HP. You get what you pay for. It's too late to send back. I have exams due.","Love everything about this product, the Microsoft word,excel,  PowerPoint, makes my reports easy.is thin so i can actually carry it around like a phone .\ud83d\ude19","Exactly what I expected and came in great condition.","Not big but not too small. Fast and sleek. Looks and works great.","So slow...and gets really hot.","N\/A","Not a powerful device but it serves its purpose. Ideal for a child where you won\u2019t worry as much about them losing or breaking it.","Updated it to Pro immediately. All the updates took all day. A little quirky at times but seems to be very handy.","Let me start off by saying this laptop is great. it's very cheap compared to other flipbooks which is nice, and its specs aren't bad considering. It's fast enough to handle normal internet browsing, and of course any office\/ school work, its touch screen is great and useful, and it's nice, light, and sleek. the one thing that could be better is the pen. if you're drawing with it you may have difficulties. It regularly will think the pen is not touching the screen for a fraction of a second, so if you hit ctrl+z it will only remove part of what you drew, sometimes this makes gaps in lines aswell. you'll have to press harder than you might be comfortable with and i havent' see na way to increase pen sensitivity just through windows ink or through pen and touch settings. This laptop only has 2 USB ports, a C type and a microUSB type, so you will likely need an adapter. and the microUSB is upsidown for some reason, which is odd. lastly if the screen is free standing, AKA not stood upsidedown like the mail thumbnail or made to look like a tablet, the screen is a bit wobbly, which is fine for touch input, but not for the pen. Overall the cons sound worse than they are, this is a great laptop, it could just use some quality of life improvements aswell as a more functional pen Pros   affordable   plenty fast for academic\/office work\/lightweight drawing software   sleek and portable   touch screen works great   touch keyboard is very responsive   all around a good experience Cons   pen sensitivity could work better   only 2 USB ports, neither of which are the traditional USB-A type   you will probably need adapters   screen is a little wobbly when using pen in 2 of 4 (or more?) possible positions","I loved the idea of having a convertible laptop, but this computer is terrible. It barely functions! I can\u2019t even scroll through Facebook without having serious delays. I would click on the screen and the mouse would be several inches away all the time, so I would have to click in a different area on the screen to get the mouse where I wanted it- even on the touchscreen! I can\u2019t stand to use this stupid thing, and I\u2019m sending it back ASAP. The only reason I\u2019m giving it two stars is because the hinge system seems really sturdy, and the touchscreen is cool (when it works). I do not recommend this laptop.","This laptop is everything I need and more. I love it. And the stylus pen is a bonus!","This laptop does everything for me.  From tablet mode to regular laptop plus it has a touchscreen. The intel processor is more than enough for what I need.  I also took this to New york and the battery lasted the entire trip and it also worked in the freezing cold outside.  I was able to run most games and also netflix.  I like this laptop for the price.  Great device.","First off, this is not a laptop for high end users.  Gamers, programmers, video editing (Adobe CC), work (including presentations) are not going to love this laptop.  However is you are looking for a low cost laptop to surf the internet, online shopping, email, photo viewing or music & video enjoyment then this is a great unit. So who would this be good for?  Folks at home and want a good , GP laptop.  I am thinking about my 75 year old mother-in-law.  She is not tech heavy, but wants something easily portable for all of the items listed above.  This is perfect for her. Also good for younger folks who are not going to push the PC too hard. Great low cost laptop.  Nice weight, nice screen, good battery and adequate sized storage.  At this price you can't beat this laptop.  Just don't expect it to be a screaming demon for high end games or power hungry programs.","This laptop is a great solution for what I was needing. I like to take my work to the coffee shops sometimes and had been using a tablet with bluetooth keyboard. While this worked fine, it was difficult to use apps like Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Illustrator, and In Design. This ASUS laptop allows me to use all of the apps I need to get the job done. The laptop was super easy to set up and it has been working flawlessly ever since. I was able to set up my emails, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Amazon Music, Amazon Video, Hulu, and Adobe CC accounts. The Intel Quad-Core Pentium N5000 processor, coupled with 4GB DDR4 memory is adequate enough to complete all of my coffee shop tasks. I\u2019m a graphic designer, so while I wouldn\u2019t rely on this as my work horse computer, it is great for what I use it for. There are 128GB of eMMC storage, which is plenty for most tasks, but if I\u2019m going through a session of uncut video, I\u2019ll just use my 1TB external drive to keep plenty of free space on the laptop. Lets talk for a moment about streaming video and music on this ASUS laptop. First of all, it streams perfectly. The computer is fast enough to easily handle streaming high quality video, of course that all depends on the available wifi connection, as with any computer or device. The sound quality on videos is excellent. I was actually surprised at how good it sounded. Listening to music, on the other hand, is just OK. I\u2019m not real sure why this is, but this laptops audio strong point is definitely movies. You can, of course, connect an external speaker or headphones as well. While this laptop does an excellent job at being a laptop, it sports another exciting feature as well. It has a touch screen! Let me say that again. IT HAS A TOUCH SCREEN! Hahahahaha The touch screen is awesome! I absolutely love it. It allows me to do fairly heavy work as a laptop, while still allowing the feel of a tablet when I want it. The screen actually folds back completely, transforming the laptop into a tablet. You can also position the screen in any position between closed and fully folded against the back of the laptop. Pretty cool! I enjoy using the drawing app, though it\u2019s not the best for creating stunningly realistic paintings. It is still a lot of fun and serves its purpose. There are a few apps included with this ASUS laptop, like an Office 365 trial. I\u2019m a bit disappointed that you have to pay for an Office subscription to keep using it though. I chose to search a free option and found a couple in the windows store that were very similar to Word and Excel. I\u2019m actually writing this review using the free software I installed. This ASUS laptop is also able to perform tasks like video chat through Skype, which is also included with the laptop, and free for other devices. While the laptops built in camera is only a VGA UVC Webcam, it does a fine job for Skypeing. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for glamour shots though. Lol The audio also does well with Skype. I was able to clearly hear my wife\u2019s voice and understand everything she said. This IS a laptop, so there is bound to be a touch pad. While I did accidentally bump it with my thumb a few times while typing (not at all the fault of the laptop), it worked really well while intentionally using it. It is basically a flat rectangle with a small printed line at the bottom, separating left and right mouse clickable areas. The track pad is smooth and didn\u2019t appear to have any glitchy spots. Clicking was nice and crisp. It worked perfectly. Overall this is an excellent little laptop that is able to stream video, stream music, web surf, email, video call, and run programs like Adobe Photoshop. I am very pleased and so far the laptop has performed perfectly with plenty of speed. I can\u2019t really say how long the battery lasts yet, but I am surprised I haven\u2019t had to recharge it yet. I charged it completely when I took it out the box and have been using on and off for a couple of weeks now. I\u2019m very happy and would highly recommend this laptop. I think it\u2019s a great deal for the price.","I have a hard time rating this. On the pro side, once I had it set up, I like the speed and responsiveness.  It isn't loaded with bloat.  The touch screen and flip keyboard makes it easy to use and flexible.  The display is nice and crisp. so from a purely functioning perspective this is a good computer But on the con side there are some things that kinda aggravated me: For one, I hate having to be tied to to an email account in order to log in.  It would not allow me past the set up unless I used a microsoft account.  Yes, you can go in after set up to allow signing on with just a local, non-email connected account but I dislike having to do it from the start.  Also no matter what, it would not recognize my professional office 365 account.  So I had to use a fall back old hotmail account. This leads to my other issue is that it runs widows10  home s which only allows downloads from the microsoft store.  So if a program or app is not in the MS store, you can't use it on this machine.  Through my employer I am allowed to download the full Microsoft 365 office suite of products to my personal computer, the desktop versions.  Except Windows 10 Home S does not allow that.  I had to find a contortionate way to finally activate my  office products (because remember it would not recognize my professional MS account during set up). So i get that this is more secure etc. etc. but is leads to some frustration and results in the loss of some autonomy. A work around is to download the Windows 10 regular Home or Pro.  I opted not to for now, but if I find that I am having issues downloading programs then I may go that route.","This SLIM touchscreen laptop would be a good choice for many light-duty users and students. It's so lightweight and slim that it is especially portable. The touchscreen is nice and the 360 degrees of folding make it an excellent, versatile laptop that can turn tablet. There is no usb-a port. It does have micro usb and usb-c ports and a SD card slot. There is a headphone jack and screen brightness is also on the side which is odd but doesn't bother me. The battery life it pretty darn good but didn't blow my mind. I suppose for being so slim the battery life really is pretty good. The speed is good and so far I've had zero hiccups or struggles with any software or use. The price point is especially good for this style of laptop, in my opinion. It would be an excellent choice for anyone with a decent basic, portable laptop or especially a student. This laptop also stays impressively cool. There are not hot areas even after an hour of use. You cannot add memory so that is one major drawback, 4GB isn't much these days. But for someone with lighter needs and at this price point, it shouldn't be a problem. If you need a real workhorse of a computer with tons of storage and memory, you probably wouldn't be looking at this model to begin with anyway. I'll update this review if anything changes! So far I'm pretty happy with it.","I wanted something very portable but with a reasonably large screen and keyboard. I looked at a couple no name imports but was concerned about reliability.  So far this seems to fill the bill. Asus is a good brand name. The 14 inch screen is quite usable.  The metal case is thin and seems durable. I don't use the touch screen much but it seems responsive. It came with a protective sleeve (nice bonus). It also included a USB adapter which I promptly misplaced. I would recommend it to others.","Bought this for my 15 year old. He loves it. His friends love it and are jealous. Will be getting my other son one for Christmas. Reasonably priced. I\u2019d definitely recommend.","Garbage. Bought the laptop new, barely used it for a month before it stopped charging. Sent it back for repairs, they spent 3 months repairing the laptop, and then it worked for about a month or two and now it turns off after 30 min of work. Asus is the worst brand I've had experience with.","no usb connection for usb mouse  this was a terrible laptop","good","Poor.  Do not buy. Problematic.","Slim and light weight. Excellent for outdoor and meeting"],"16":["I'm unsure why there's bad reviews, but I wouldn't listen to them. I actually decided on this computer while at Best Buy where I was able to look and touch the computer before purchasing. I've been using Microsoft\/HP my ENTIRE life. I was extremely unsure about a chromebook. I went back and forth with myself for weeks. But let me say this, if you're an android lover, this chromebook will come as a second nature. It's based off the Google play store, and some of the features are great! (Like, if you have your phone unlocked nearby, you do not have to input a password to your computer.) Biggest selling points was the screen size. Most of the chromebooks I found are much smaller and this has a HUGE screen with such beautiful quality. The display settings also offer a night light\/blue light filter which I absolutely LOVE about it! Battery life is great and just all around great computer. Speed is lightning fast, I actually expected less. I have nothing bad to say about this laptop. If you haven't bought it already, I'm not sure what you're waiting for.","I love this Chromebook. The price was great, the screen is nice and large, battery life lasts a long time and it isn't heavy. This works great for school and fits all of my needs. I haven't come across a situation where I needed a PC or different system.  I'm very pleased with getting a 2018 model for under $200, especially with the screen size. The speakers are nicer than the last Chromebook model I had as well. I'm very happy with this purchase.","For 90 percent of the populous this will more than meet your demands. Extremely fast startup. More like instant. Picture quality is great. Operational speed very fast. Metal case. Automatically updates. Many apps available for it.  No viruses. If you are tired of windows short comings and you mostly do internet based usage, then this is what you want. Low price to boot! In my opinion its a win win.","Chromebook fanatic. Have several. This is an upgrade from 3 yr old 15\" Chromebook. Faster. Brilliant colors. Improved keyboard. For $200 you can't go wrong. REVISED to 3 stars. Downgraded for low screen resolution. While it is faster than my 2 yr old Chromebook with same size screen the resolution is 1366 x 768 vs 1920 x 1080 on the older computer. At first I thought it was just my eyes but I have tweaked as much as possible and it still isn't as clear as I would prefer. I have owned several Acer's over the last few years but this may be my last one. Asus is (in my opinion) a much better computer albeit at a higher price. About $150 more than this Acer but it comes with more storage and a higher resolution screen. It is also faster than the Acer.","Having used HP laptops for years, through various operating systems, I decided to try a Chromebook because I simply can't stand Windows 10. It's slow, ponderous, and takes forever to update. The price of this computer was a definite plus. It's quick and agile, and I'm very comfortable with the Android OS. It took fewer than 5 minutes to set up this computer, from the time I plugged it in until I turned it off. For the big stuff I still have my desktop computer (also Acer), but I can see myself using this laptop gem for a lot more tasks. I feel this was a wise decision and purchase.","Amazing great inexpensive Chromebook! I purchased this for my in-laws that are not at all techies to replace a dog slow old Dell  laptop, and they absolutely love it! I am very impressed with the quality of it and the performance for basic functions such as email, web surfing, YouTube videos etc. Setup was a breeze! ChromeOS found the local USB printer and got it working right away automatically. The build quality is solid for a basic 15.6 inch laptop. The battery life is great (12 hours). The screen quality is perfectly good as well. Nice snappy little laptop!","Previously had a Mac laptop computer and have the iPad and iMac needed a laptop to write while recovering from surgery.  Purchased this as a temporary fix.  It is really a nice computer and for the price would be great for college students.  If you are used to typing fast of the mac you'll find this different.  Most actions involve two key steps.  For an unknown reason when typing fast I find the cursor moves up and I have to stop and re position it.  Could be user error....","I have had the computer for 3 months. It has been running very efficiently. What a great price!","Bought this for my 84 year old mother. I bought her one in 2015 she loved it. It got a lot of use by a lot of people. Im sure it just needs a new battery and the bottom battery port. The bottom is because a family member messed with it and cracked it not acer's issue. but, because it is a 2015 there are not a lot of parts for me to fix it and she really missed surfing the web.. which is what chromebooks are great for! The battery life lasted 4 days before she had to recharge. She wasn't on it a lot this week. But the battery is a lot longer lasting than the 2015. it is wonderful for her to do what she does, goes on facebook, pay bills, and clicks on stuff that would give a normal laptop a virus! but, since Chromebooks run everything through a sandbox , they don't get viruses. I have the c720 from 5 years ago and im using it to put up this review. they update regularly and quickly by time you restart it has updated. Everything you used to do on Windows , Chrome has  google docs and other programs for that. i do not miss windows one bit.  Great machine at a great price! love Acer's Google Chromebooks.","UPDATE: LIGHTNING SP33D + MOUSE IS NEEDED!  ..WHAT REFURB? Omygod$! : ) I AM ESTATIC! PERFECTION! PERFECTION! PERFECTION!.. ARRIVED TODAY! A++ BATTERY LIFE, SCREEN, & EASY 2USE ... ADDED MY WIFI .. WITH EASE ..SIGN INTO MY GOOGLE WITH EASE.. SETUP WITH EASE.. Time along with date ..is set for you...

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ..LOVE THE LIGHT WEIGHT.. PICTURES WILL BE ADDED .. Perfect place for speakers!","At first it seems like a great laptop for the price. After about a week the computer started to slow down drastically. The OS is interesting to use and a lot of simple tasks become complicated because of the limitations of the OS. The computer runs alright when only one tab is open but once multiple tabs are opened the computer runs real slow and pages load super slow. I bought this because I fried my MacBook and needed a quick cheap replacement while I worked on getting my MacBook repaired. I used the computer for about two weeks until I got fed up and just bought a new MacBook. I would not recommend this laptop for anyone unless all you plan on doing is watching youtube videos (even youtube loads\/runs slow) and maybe checking emails. I would not recommend this laptop to anyone who is looking to use it for work as it runs slow and reduces productivity significantly. Battery life is no good either, a full charge lasts a couple hours just simply browsing the web. The only nice thing about the laptop is how it syncs with everything Google, but then again, any laptop can do that nowadays. Don't waste your money trying to buy a cheap computer like this; do some research and get something with a legitimate OS.","When I started looking for a new Laptop, I wanted something different from my Dell. I was just about done with all the glitches with Windows. I came across this model and I have to say I am more than satisfied with it. The set up took minutes and very easy. The battery life is strong, and my apps for TV and gaming are working smoothly. Great for all your usual email and doc's. I am happy I chose this product.","Computer was so slow, kept shutting down, and had to return it.  Terrible investment for college.","Screen is big.Everything works.","I bought this chromebook under the advice of my 16 year old grandson because I dont have the knowledge about computers like he does and he was right! I love my new chromebook! I like the wider screen like this one has, the brightness, etc.. I don't need or want anything fancy, just wanted a simple computer that I can learn and move around on. We did a lot of comparisons on them. I highly recommend this one because it is what I needed and the back stays up too! I like the company I bought it from and would buy from them again.","This advertised fast speed internet and ease of use, neither of those were true. Once I had more than two tabs open the computer it was slower than a granny taking a Sunday drive. Save your money get a decent laptop. This was just one disappointment after another. I really wanted to love it too.","I bought a Chrome book because every 2 minutes my old computer had a pushy pop up sales advertisement saying it \"suggest\" I use Chrome because it was faster.  So sorry now.  I can't even do my taxes on it because Turbo Tax doesn't work on it!!  It is so different from Windows you have to relearn about clicking on different file extensions to open various files.  Are you serious? The scroll bar is so narrow, even on a 15 inch screen, I can rarely click on it the first or second time.  To \"right click\" on the touchpad  I have to hammer it down with my finger.  I can't even use this.","I love everything on. It very easy computer to use very good screen and sound","This chromebook is decent at most. And definitely useable. Cons: The problems for me with this device is the screen is bad, the viewing angles are terrible and its only 720p also this device is slow at times when opening up chrome\/amazon. And I dont know if this is a problem with my unit but the right click on the touchpad dont work out the box, found a solution to this problem by tapping both fingers on the mouse pad at once and it makes a right click, its a bit unconvienient, overall decent. Pros: Screen is large and good looking laptop, it will be supported for five more years and it comes with a year's 100gb google drive overall decent chromebook for starting.","This is a low end, kinda underpowered machine. That's not a complaint, just the fact. I'm finding it useful for Office 365 in Chrome - don't bother with the Office apps. I also have the Fortinet VPN client to access the company VPN. And I found a good RDP client to connect to computers in the office. All in all, a good machine for the money for what I'm doing with it. And it's Android, so there isn't the maintenance overhead of a Windows machine. Buy em for your road warriors. EDIT 17 Jan 19 - I'm currently working to get the StrongSwan VPN client to working in order to connect Point-To-Site to my Azure VPN. I know it can be done, but getting the StrongSwan configuration correct is a bear. If anyone out there has used StrongSwan to connect P2S to an Azure VPN, send me a comment. Otherwise, I'll post when I get it working on my own. Why do this? So that I can access my Linux VMs via SSH and my Windows Server VMs via RDP.","I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I've been working on an 8 year old laptop until this year. The letters would stick. Some were faded. It was slow. I knew I couldn't go into a new year without a new computer. That is why I was glad to stumble upon this Acer. Love that it's affordable, does all the things I need and is a definite upgrade from what I had. Lots of great features that I am still playing with. The most important thing is that it allows me to do the work I need to do in a much quicker way. If you are needing a new computer that will fit your needs and not break the bank, this is definitely one to take a look at.","Easy to set up, screen quality is good. This is great for a beginner. Audio sounds clear.","I bought this Chromebook for my boss who has almost no computer experience, but I've finally got him at least checking his email. This snazzy little machine is great for anyone who primarily wants access to the internet and Google services. It's fast and has a lot of versatility but getting it to pair with a printer is a bear. It couldn't see our older model Canon deskjet at all, wired or wireless. It apparently has something to do with the operating system Chrome uses. (I am strictly  an end user myself, but not a complete novice.) A little online research told us that HP printers were more amenable to Chromebook, so we ordered a little HP (your welcome, Amazon). I was finally able to get the Chromebook to recognize the HP when wired, but not wireless. Both Chromebook and HP help was cumbersome and ultimately useless. I really wanted to love this Chromebook and had great hopes for it. I'm still impressed with what it does offer, but something as simple as pairing it with a printer should not be such an issue.","I am a nursing student, and my old laptop (a Lenovo yoga) finally died on me after so many years. I needed an upgraded laptop for starting the nursing program. I did lots of research on various laptops that are great for students and I could not have chosen a better laptop. Although the laptop takes a few weeks to get used to, the keyboard set up is a bit different (nothing that causes any difficulty typing) and the screen is fairly large. The large screen works in my favor. I have the ability to split the screen between two windows, so I can simultaneously write my papers while referencing the article all in one. The memory on this laptop is amazing, and allows me to save my files in any form (pdf,word,open document,etc) making submissions for various classes easy. The fact that this is a google computer is one of the main reasons i love it so much. I have everything I need readily available and Google makes this a laptop that is super easy to navigate. 10\/10 would recommend to any student. I'm not sure about gaming capabilities or anything outside of my academic needs, but I can't imagine that there is anything this laptop can do well.","I like the look of it and it works great. I hate the fact that it does not have the key pad to the right of the keyboard like my Dell laptop.  I also don't like that it has no CD drive but I knew that when I bought it. Good price and a good product but would not buy another one, just my preference, as I like the laptop with the CH\/DVD and the numeric key pad better than this Chromebook.","I searched laptops by ratings and came across this one...I wasn't looking to break the bank.  I received this laptop in 2 days...and was able to set it up in minutes (which is quite a feat as I am technically challenged)  - I've had 5-6 windows opened at a time and it runs fast and easy....I can't believe what a great laptop I got for the money!","It's a bit slow in terms of performance but it worked out great for limited use cases and patient users.","This computer is cheap; I knew that going in but I was hoping that it would have basic functioning for writing. All I was looking for is a device that I could use to go to the coffee shop or library and write. This machine can't even handle that task. Not to mention, the resolution is horrible. It is unbelievably disfunctional. I will be returning this thing as soon as possible.","This is a great chromebook. This is my first time to purchase a chromebook. I only use it to go online. For this price, it is perfect, no complaints.","I tried ... I really did. This is so slow that I can literally fix a cup of coffee while my gmail loads. Then I can usually feed the cats while I wait for items to delete from my gmail. If I want to compose an email, it's another miserably long wait. I have to add my printer again and again ... at least three or four times a week. It is not my internet connection because my husband's laptops run just fine and he is able to run CAD programs with ease. I have to say, it does start up and shut down quickly. I guess I will use it as an external hard drive to keep my photos and documents.","There are enough of this type of review that I shouldn't have risked it, but man, what a disappointment. It was a 'wow, you got into college' gift for a kid I tutor who just needed a basic laptop and he was so tickled and then the thing powered up, but the screen remained black.  Then there was a 10-minute scramble trying all the tricks, the inevitable call to tech services and finally, the sad repacking it up to return it.  I am not reordering it. Found a faster one, for less $ at a big box store that I am picking up in person today. Not a big deal but in terms of gift-giving, it sucked.","The power connection is the most flimsy I've ever seen, and keeps coming out. It's tiny, and it's loose even when its in there. What a corner to cut!","The problem was with the operating system, namely Chrome OS, which seems fine for many, probably those who grew up with Android phones. But for us old-school Microsoft folk it was like Greek, not nearly enough help, unintuitive (at least to us) with all sorts of unexplained symbols that did important things (the Greek!). Plus it wants to send everything to the cloud or Google Drive and with our rural snail\u2019s pace internet connection, that would take FOREVER! So now we\u2019ll try Windows 10 in S mode, which is supposed to make things easier while looking familiar, though, like Google or Apple, everything has to go through Microsoft, for apps, having to use Bing (bye-bye Chrome and Firefox). We\u2019ll see\u2026.. (Interestingly you can opt out of the S mode but not opt back in, hmmmmm)","I haven't purchased a new PC in a decade or more and this is the worst PC i've ever purchased. A PC built in 2018 should be able to play youtube videos without lag. i installed Cog an app to view system info and the CPU and memory usage has been maxed, even when nothing is running. i uninstalled a half dozen extensions. closed all extra apps and the thing still can't keep up. what a piece of poop","This was a birthday gift for my 16 year old son. He loves it and uses it daily for homework and entertainment. Its an awesome piece for the price.","Out of blue the browser changes to a new one with only 1 tab with no way to recover the one you had open, outlook and other Microsoft apps quit working.  I've used computers since 1981, long before the WWW. I would not recommend this to anyone, not even to my ex-wife.","I bought two of these for my high school and junior high students and two months later they have been flawless and used extensively. They easily access cloud drives, write and submit papers for school in both Google Docs and Office 365 (running in browser) and take them to school in their backpacks on occasion. I even managed to get them to print to my WiFi network printer. I expected to have to help them often with technical hurdles but have not had a single  If WiFi is not readily available, you won't want this (or any Chromebook). But if it is and you aren't looking to install Windows apps, this is worth every penny and then some. I bought the extended warranty, because kids. Even with that cost tacked on, it is still well worth the price.","It is very stressful for me to get new tech, being a more \"experienced\" person. My last phone had me wanting to throw it into large vats of water or stomp it with both feet and I did return it 3 times before finally managing to semi-adjust to it and I now have a so-so relationship with that piece of frustrating technology. So, when my Mac Air started to circle the drain I dreaded getting a new lap top. When my son recommended Chromebook I was skeptical that it could be as simple as it sounded to set up and use. But I was totally amazed!!! I had the lap top open and I was logged in with gmail in 5 minutes. Anything that I have needed to do has been easy to google. The screen quality and sound are both better than I had with the Mac but it was pretty old. The simple set up, speed and use of docs and downloads has been easy and I didn't have to buy software extra like I did with Mac.  I also found connecting to my HP printer was much easier than the process to connect on my Mac. For me to transition from a Mac to the Chromebook was very smooth. This screen is so much larger than my Mac and has taken some getting used to. At this price my husband has encouraged me to get a smaller one to carry when we go somewhere but I am adjusting to this larger size.  I thought the large size would be a viewing plus and it is. It's heavier than the small Mac and that is the adjustment. I use it for basics and work- banking, contracts, etc and I am very pleased!!! I will add that I never liked iPhones but did like my Mac Air but like the Chromebook much better so far.","09-30-19 Just received these today so take this review in stride as I usually try and update my reviews every couple months on expensive purchases like these. I bought two of these, they came at a great price, and right NOW I'm loving them. For me the screen size and picture quality are great. No issues as others seemed to have with resolution. My kids (11 and 12) are familiar with them because they use similar devices at school. They're seemingly fast, efficient and user friendly. They came ready to use right out of the box and limited effort on my part needed to be exerted to place monitoring controls on them. 10-7-19 So, I haven't even had these products a week and one of the units wont turn on and will not hold a charge. I've contacted the customer support team (located in India i.e. thick accents) these individuals are extremely difficult to understand, talk fast, and I \"lost connection\" twice. Long story short I have to wait for a shipping label, go to a fed ex store, send it in for repairs and wait 7 to 10 business days for those repairs to be made. This unit is my daughter's so you can imagine how thrilled she'll be about all of this. 10-30-19 So, I went to the fed-ex store to ship these back. I had to purchase a special box for the chromebook, that cost $25, as shipping it in the box it came in and bubble wrap wouldn't protect it completely. It came back within the 7 to 10 business days as promised.....in a different box, upside down and wrapped in bubble wrap. Seriously?!?!?? Anyway it's working right now.","It actually worked out better than expected. I bought this with the full intention of hacking it through developer mode and doing a chroot Linux install, which runs alongside the boot OS and avoids by using the main OS to interface with devices. I wanted a client to play my Windows desktop and Shadow cloud PC at my girlfriend's and when I travel. So I installed moonlight and shadow on Linux. They both work beautifully and the Wi-Fi connection is rock solid. But I have come to realize the fact it is very nice to boot into Chrome OS instantly if I just want to surf the web or do basic Android apps (no hardware acceleration for that or the built-in Linux feature in the beta channel, which is one reason I did the chroot install, so don't plan on using that to game), initiate the Linux desktop if I want a multi-purpose full desktop experience, or if I want full-on gaming, connect to my PC or my Shadow Cloud PC and let it rip. Even when connected to my Shadow cloud PC, the battery life is still incredible. It doesn't get very warm. The Wi-Fi connection is rock solid. The screen has a narrow viewing angle but the picture quality is actually pretty good. The colors get a little bit deeper if you give yourself a few feet from the screen which is easy if you use a game controller to play a good number of your games. It was an incredible buy for $200 and got me what I need it to do without having to buy a Microsoft license or buy from one of those expensive custom Linux laptop companies.","I purchased this to upgrade from an old HP Chromebook I've used for years due to some dead pixels on the HP screen. This Acer is noticeably slower despite having twice the RAM, particularly wit h the new Gmail. In addition, the keyboard is lower quality and the mousepad is extremely loud.  To top it off, this one actually cost more than my old one. Was tempted to return it, but kept it as a backup. Still looking for a replacement for my old one.","I have always been a PC fan and have never previously owned a Chromebook. I have been looking for an MS alternative for a while as the issues and maintenance of a MS PC have grown old. I wanted an easy to use and maintain system that was inexpensive but still fast to boot up and use. The Chromebook fit all of those requirements nicely. The setup of this system was very easy and the interface isn't that different from an Android phone. It didn't take long at all to figure out where everything was located and so far the system has worked flawlessly. The battery life is great and the 15.6\" screen is the same size as the older laptop that it replaced. I was able to show my non-PC savvy wife how to use this system without any problems. The hardware is more than capable of running the Chrome OS and there are plenty of apps available to do just about anything that you could want to do. The only shortfall would be if you require a specific software that will only run on a MS PC then this system would not work for you. For the vast majority of users this system will work fine. I have a relative who purchased an expensive MacBook and this Chromebook is very comparable to that system at less than 1\/3 of the cost. I would definitely recommend this Chromebook.","Got this one to replace my 2013 Acer model.  I never had any issues with my 2013 Acer..just not Google Chrome software supported anymore. Still works great... I just don\u2019t want it connected to WiFi with updates no longer available. Sooo purchased new Acer and It is great!!!!! Wonderful sound, keyboard touch is great, screen great, download speed is amazing!!!!  It\u2019s  just GREAT!!!! I am so impressed with the price....and thankful that it\u2019s affordable. Easy setup... I  took it out of the box, plugged it up, turned it on, connected to WiFi and then logged onto my google account.... and bam.. perfection!!!! So thank you Acer and Google.","Update: I am bringing my review down to 3 stars for now as I had to just send the computer back to the manufacturer because it wouldn't turn on. I have had the computer less than 2 months and already an issue. Before this happened I did like the computer and loved how fast it loaded and operated as just a basic model laptop. However, not even 2 months later it wont turn on and I had to pay to ship to the manufacture to see what the issue is. I bought this as a replacement to the laptop that I had. The one I had was extremely slow and would have an error and restart on its own every once in awhile. This Chromebook is a 1000x faster than the old laptop. It's great for just a computer to have access to the internet. If you don't need much out of a laptop then this one is great, has a couple USB ports and an HDMI port as well as blue tooth ability. I also like how the screen is less reflective so it has less glare. Overall, great product for the short time I have had it!","I love my chromebook very simple and easy and dont freeze up like windows and like that  if you have gmail evreything is tide together I love it. especially the screen  I just need something simple and this  does the job. I highly recommend it.","As i said, pretty much bought from every vendor and so far msi and dell r the ones that have helped even when a few days out of warranty. cant say the same about acer. they forgot to install something on the laptop n i just went ahead n bought it after they denied helping me with the parts that were suppose to b in the laptop in the first place. surely will b my last acer product.","You get what you pay for at $200.00.  Celeron is slow, pages load slower on the web than my MacBook Pro. Good for simple task and web surfing but I would not use it for real work.  For that get a real computer.  Another quirk is you need to be connected to the internet for this to work.  Chromebook does not support Adobe reader even though some websites say, I tried their methods and it don't work. Maybe I should have gotten a different model but I'm not wasting my time or money on another Chromebook.  As Will Rogers said, Good judgement comes from experience which come from bad judgement.","Really good so far.","I bought this for my husband.  At the time I didn't realize it was re-furbished.  I think the price I paid for this was as much as a brand new PC.  I only realized it was re-furbished after I looked at the receipt.  I bought it as a gift for father's day. Not wanting the hassle of sending it back we kept it and I have to say it is working well.  It's kind of big and clunky like the older model PC's I guess that's what happens when you shop late at night and don't pay attention.  So far so good my husband likes it let's hope it holds out","Only complaint is that the screen quality is poor in my opinion.  Connected it to an external monitor and it is perfect.  For the price it is darn good.","Disclaimer: I bought this for a second computer, just for back up, email, and surfing the web. I didn't buy to download anything like Excel, or Word, or Paint Shop Pro. This is not my work computer, nor do I game on it. That being said, I absolutely love this computer. It has a very intuitive interface, and was pretty much plug in and play. I was ready to use the computer within minutes of taking it out of the box. I like it a lot more than a phone or tablet because (being old school), I touch type very fast, and touch screen typing slows me down. After decades of struggling with clunky Microsoft (and their viruses), I plan on using a Chromebook from now on for non-work, non-gaming social interaction, paying bills, and shopping.","I just use my home computer for entertainment purposes only.  Internet, mostly and storing Albums.  If that's all you need just get this one and save $$.","Great, lightweight laptop, at a very affordable price.  Came ready to go out of the box.  Just had to charge it a little but it fired up in about 3 seconds.  After about 2 mins setting up my info for Gmail, it was ready to go.  All my settings transferred over.  All my Chrome bookmarks did as well.  Screen quality is very good.  Sound is good as well.  Keyboard types quietly.  So far, it's exactly what the advertisement says it is.  Perfect for anyone that just needs to surf the internet, or work on Google Docs\/Gmail related items.  Great for the price. Very fast!","I had been a PC user for a very long time.  A friend gave me a chrombook several years ago.  I grew to love having it in the family room to surf the net and read email.  I still did most of my work on my PC.  After my PC died, i was using my chromebook for more but it also abruptly died recently.  I purchased an inexpensive PC and was unhappy with it's performance as compared to my chromebook. After a few weeks of research, I found this Acer 15.6\" screen Chromebook.  In the few weeks I have had this computer, it has far exceeded my expectations.  It is my first experience with an Acer.  It seems very well made and the size and weight are great for me.  I love the size of the screen, the same as most PC laptops. If you haven't tried a Chromebook, they are the perfect computer for someone who is looking to search on the internet, stream videos, and check email.  They are ready to use out of the box and integrate with your Google account.","I purchased this laptop thinking I would love it since I generally use google chrome for pretty much everything, however I hate this laptop. Majority of my documents aren't compatible with chromebook operating system even google doc that I created previously using microsoft systems. This laptop isn't compatible with my printer, apparently I need to purchase a bluetooth printer since this laptop won't connect with my current printer via USB, screen quality is blurry looks like it's out of focus, can never get the resolution quite right, battery life is pretty good, laptop is sleek and light weight, overall just not what I expected will probably end up purchasing another laptop with microsoft operating system.","I got this as an extra computer to use at work (light use-checking emails, etc) . I like that the screen is large. It is quite heavy, which I don't really mind. It gets kind of glitchy at times, especially when more than one web page is open at the same time (I don't even mind that) . Battery life is amazing. The reason for the 2 stars is the screen resolution. The very first smartphones that came out had better resolution than this screen. I realize you'll get less screen resolution because of the price of this laptop, but this was horrible. Makes it very hard to see without squinting and adjusting the screen all the time, which also doesn't help much.","We needed a cheap laptop to do Gmail and Google Docs only. We bought this in September 2019. The screen is large and bright, and the sound is outstanding, but there is a painful delay when interacting with Gmail and Google Docs, even if only one tab is open in Chrome. Compared to the Windows 7 laptop we bought for about $300 back in 2011, it boots quickly of course, but is noticeably slower once you are in Gmail. Some browser tweaking didn't make any noticeable improvement.","So I literally just got this today, love everything about it except when I opened a youtube video. the sound quality SUCKS~~~~~~~~~~!!!! and the volume height is SOOOooo loooowwWW. ughhhh I need to send this back now and get a less cheepbook with better quality sound this will not do, videos is basically all I use this for. . . my lame old cheap cell phone sound quality sounds way better than this. Boo!","Great so far, but I only used it a short time. We'll see how well it helps up!","I dont think ill buy one of these chrome books ever again . I'm used to being able to do things on a regular windows PC easily . Unless you're doing something  VERY BASIC with this computer I'd steer clear for something better.  Even a standard cheap laptop. If  you need to do things for work or tasks such as uploading\/ opening\/finding files etc. (Which I considered basic in itself) expect to find frustration  from the awkward unfamiliar keyboard placement to just trying to enter information online and it refreshing and not being able to register that the information was imputed correctly. I'd honestly get rid of this if this wasn't my sole computer right now and not having funds for a new one .","This laptop will hopefully bring me into the 21st century with its ever-evolving computer technology. For years I've lagged behind the rest of the world with unreliable internet connections and other problems. As my 2nd device Chromebook seems to have fixed that. My old notebook now snaps to attention when I tell it to connect. Maybe it's just afraid of losing its job! In any case I'm happy with the purchase.","I like how easy it was to setup. The functionality of it is very user friendly. I just needed a computer for internet\/email\/documents. This is a basic and perfect laptop for what I needed. It has met my needs. My only complaint is the screen can be kind of hard to see at certain angles. But definitely not enough to be a deal breaker for me and I'm finicky. Also, I wish the keyboard was back-lit. But also, not a deal breaker for the price. I couldn't see using this for gaming. But I'm not a gamer.","Our desktop computer crashed so looked for something portable and great value.  Very easy to complete setup and start web surfing. We do not use for gaming, but for banking and some web surfing. Great battery life and fast proceesor.","Love this laptop but I will say that if you are a student, a Chromebook may not be the best choice. Especially if you have online classes. Some of the software we have to use for my online classes is not compatible with Chromebook. Only windows or Mac. I ended up having to use my old crappy windows laptop to complete some assignments. So I'm disappointed with that considering I got this computer for school. But it is great for general use. Very fast and easy to use. I love that all my stuff is synced through Google.","I didn't like moving the cursor around with my fingers. That is why I bought myself a wireless mouse. It is easier for me since I am older and used to a mouse. Otherwise I love it.  Wanted to use it for ancestry.com. So much better to have a larger screen (15.6) than a small one that I was using on my Kindle.","I waited a few months to review. Use this for streaming, nice big screen, and poking around on line. The big keyboard isnt comfortable for me and the keys aren't back lighted but not a deal breaker for me.  If you are a student or someone doing a lot of typing or at night, just something to consider. Excellent value and price. Would buy again.","I'm not a computer geek, so I can't give you any kind of computer lingo for this device. My MIL, almost 80 years old, likes to do some internet surfing, going through her e-mail, and playing solitaire. For her this is a great option. It doesn't have Windows so it is more secure as well.  It was strange for me when I was setting it up for her. I had a hard time finding things (I'm used to a computer with Windows on it). But once I tootled around with it I was able to find my way around and knew this would work for her.  My husband and I ended up buying an Acer tower and I love it. It does have Windows on it (I do a lot of word processing), and the browser is super fast compared to what we had.","I got it for internet browsing and internet browsing alone. Battery life is great. Screen size is great. Price is great. Would recommend 100%.","NOT for people who need a serious laptop! There is no full Word version available for this Chromebook, and that\u2019s my biggest objection. Memory is so limited, you must be a cloud-lover to embrace it (I\u2019m not one). Gave this to my husband to Facebook and email with\u2014it\u2019s fine for that\u2014and I bought a Lenovo laptop with 1 terabyte instead.","I have two of these laptops (one older) but this one was to replace a very old chromebook that finally gave up on him. I have a Windows laptop too but these are faster. If you're not used to working with apps and researching what you can do on a chromebook, you'll have a learning curve. The only issue I've had is some apps aren't all they say they are (Microsoft Word) but I've had my Windows 10 crash plenty too.","This chromebook exceeded my expectations. Its everything I was looking for. I bought it for my out of state vacation so I could do my homework online. Its quick, extremely portable, and the battery life is amazing! I get 10 hrs out of it every charge. If you're expecting this to be able to play games you're asking too much. Light web browsing and working on documents\/papers are what this thing was made for. Cant beat the price either.","Gave to Grand kids for Christmas and they were playing on them in 15 minutes. They love this little unit and I can't believe the price for the quality!","It's great!  It's like I open the screen and it's ready to use...  It is soooo responsive.  It's fast.  I totally recommend it.  You know, I had doubts.  I thought the screen resolution and quality were not going to be so good.  But they are actually really good. I got this laptop for my 80 year old mom.  She thinks it's excellent too.  You know, it's not windows...  Right click with a 2 finger press.  Scroll down... use 2 fingers on the mouse touchpad.  It's simple.  It's fast. It's good.","This is an amazing price. I have a Mac, HP and a Toshiba, all of which I use for different reasons and have paid from $1500  to $5000+. This Acer is used in my den to access email, shop and google. I do not use it for gaming. Need it simple and inexpensive this is it. I noticed that the schools were using it so I decided to give it a try. Glad I did. Nice large screen and key board. Picture quality is good and the sound is very nice. It seems that many computers could use improvement in this area. The battery life is excellent!  A little heavy, but that's OK.","I like the storage, and the screen quality. I do not like the face that it still is not a \"lap\" top so to speak.  A laptop had a cd\/dvd in it... this does not.... a laptop is compatible with games that have been purchased and downloaded... this Acer is not. So if you have down loads some will not be compatible and you might want to rethink.... other than that.... it is pretty decent.","I have actually returned this product, but not because it wasn't a good product. The screen size is huge and the image quality is nice. With that being said, this is basically a Samsung phone on a laptop. If you're a Samsung user, this is very easy to maneuver and use. I was looking for something I could use for school, and this just didn't fit the bill. It could've been because I didn't know what the laptop was about until I tried it out, so it's not necessarily that it was a bad laptop, it just didn't suit my needs.","I wish I'd know how less than crystal clear the screen was before buying. I've accepted it now but it's definitely subpar especially for the price.","I have worked from a MacBook Air for several years. However, I desired a Unit to use for entertainment in bed when I could not sleep. So I purchased this unit for the price, and size only knowing it would do all I was asking of it. I am very satisfied with the result and not qualified to answer anything else about the unit.","It\u2019s a great product if you want a Chromebook and don\u2019t mind that every application is web based. My son called it a \u201cgiant portable phone, passing itself off as a computer!\u201d It literally operates like our cell phones, do include needing to download the android version of MS applications. You can use Google docs; however, you can\u2019t use any word processing applications unless you\u2019re connected to the internet. It also lacks certain familiar keys on the keyboard, so you will need to Google the keyboard shortcuts. The Chromebook was frustrating to me. Thank goodness Amazon let me return it!","This is a great chrome book for those who looking to browse, watch you tube videos(with not very great but acceptable quality), awesome if you use google docs and other products. Battery life is awesome. Durability is good, although (and thank god) I did not get a chance to check it but this is surviving with my young kids. It is. Buy in each side but I don\u2019t mind as price is unbeatable. I would recommend it.","love Acer Chromebooks, but some are too slow, choppy, pause while you're typing, etc. very frustrating","This has basically replaced my work laptop. I open this and it's ready to roll where my work laptop takes anywhere from 1-3 minutes to get going--Windoze.  There are very few things that I cannot accomplish on this Chromebook, and I have found some work arounds or solutions to most of my challenges.  Easy to set up and use, I'd  recommend this to anyone who is tired of waiting for their computer to update all the time.","Bought this to work on a huge ancestry project because I needed something faster than my old laptop or phone or tablet. It is SUPER Fast, but you can't use a lot of apps that you may be used to. The streaming quality for music and videos is abysmal. If you need something larger than your tablet and just use it for internet reference, it'll work, but if you want more, spend the extra $50 and get an economical laptop from Walmart or anywhere. I would have returned it, but not worth the hassle. Still need to run 3 separate devices while working on projects.","This is the chromebook that I have wanted for a very long time. The screen at 15.6\" is perfect for these old eyes. The quality of the screen brings a very sharp clear picture. The chromebook is very light for it's size. Well done Acer you have a very happy customer.","Received yesterday. So far it's easy to use and pretty fast. The only bad thing is the screen resolution. It really is poor. Update, had to call acer tech support twice. It won't charge. Sent back for repair. At first they wanted to charge me for sending it back after owning for two weeks!  Got it back, it still wasn't fixed. They sent a whole new power cord, it worked for a while but started the same again. What a piece of JUNK.","The only thing I don't like about my new Acer Chromebook is that it doesn't have a CAPS LOCK key. I keep hitting the key that is CAPS LOCK on other laptops and computers and it takes me to the menu. Very frustrating when I'm in the middle of writing and I need to write a long word or phrase in all capital letters. Other than that, it is a great laptop and I enjoy it very much.","Exactly what the description said. Wish it had a touch screen then it would be perfect! Long battery life., over 12 hrs!  Screen appears dark at sharp angles. Touch pad is very responsive. Must open chrome account. It's free and easy. No life story needed.","I was swayed with the bigger screen and the HDMI port; but have found it to be noticeably slower than previous HP Chromebook purchases. I had 3 HPs but wanted to try something different. If this was my very first one, I would be impressed; but I also see that the resolution is wanting compared to my old one, which is still on the floor in front of me; but it kept losing the cursor and I finally bought this one.","Signed into the chromebook for the first time and it worked for three minutes. System locked up , spent almost two hours on the phone with Acer to try to fix it . The  operating system was corrupted and damaged . Sent it back! Last time I will purchase a computer online at any online store. I will pay more locally for electronics, but it will be worth it.","I bought this to take on the road and connect to Bluetooth so I could use my iPhone as a hot spot. No such luck. It connects for a few seconds then disconnects. The whole reason I bought it and it don't work. From searching, this apparently is an known issue with Chrombooks and has been for a while yet Google won't fix it. Never had these problems with a Windows laptop.","The device works as intended and is okay dispite feeling like an over grown Android phone I would say the only upside is how it keeps my Google photos so I don't have to lose any important pictures. Outside of that it often freezes and I need to sign out then sign back in.  The memory is so lack luster I would say this is best as an inbetween investment than anything long term. I will be looking to return this with in the following days as it does not me the needs I desire. Since Amy programs I use require a Windows OS and not a chromo OS.","Made the switch from Windows to chromebook and am happy with it.","chrome books are way faster than notebooks and more reliable for most of what i use them for. this is the second chromebook i have owned both acer and i have not been dissapointed in either of them.","Its slow, colors contrast is terrible and if you click on a story and in it is a sidebar, click on that and its impossible to read as the scroll feature is uncontrollable and the drop down ads take forever to download.  in some situations the scrol down feature disappears entirely.","This is the second Chromebook I've had and I love it. I mostly surf websites, pay bills, email, text, and use Google Drive\/photos. I don't use it for gaming. The screensize and weight is perfect if you need to carry it somewhere or just use at home.","How unfortunate. Did not suit my needs at all. I purchased this Chromebook to use primarily for remote desktop software. I didn't have audio when working in music production applications. I have never had that issue before with other Chromebooks. I couldn't even get sound in Google Play Music remotely (just did that to test the machine), or any other mp3 player for that matter. The Chromebook also kept restarting and was sluggish. I had high hopes, but Acer is now on my \"do not buy\" list.","The computer box had a previous shipping label to someone in another state that was covered over with blank shipping labels so I an unsure if I have a new, open box or renewed computer. I paid for a new computer and am puzzled by the old shipping labels. The box it was sent in to me was oversize and only my shipping label, but the computer box inside had the old shipping label covered over.","Love it, so happy with my purchase.  I have a smaller Chrome Book I bought a few years ago thru Amazon and it still works great too.  Just wanted something bigger, so very easy to use because of already being established with my previous chrome book.","This product has quality for the money.","I am not computer savvy at all. I got this computer all set up within 5 minutes (probably less). It has everything I need for a home laptop. And it uploaded everything from my google account. Very happy.","For less than $200, I am quite pleased with this laptop. I'm not sure why there is a rating for 'touch-screen' as the screen is a normal one. I'm kind of bummed out that I can't play Old-School Runescape on it normally, but I'm sure I'll get over it (I have the iPhone app). This OS runs smooth and fast for me and it's a nice & simple laptop for my upcoming semester. Battery charges fairly quickly and is truly long-lasting. I'll update this the more I use it.","I read that this would work great for school and college, which is what I needed it for, but it had so little processing power that it would lag when I wrote in Microsoft Word. If I had more than 2 tabs open lagging would begin. I knew that it wouldn't be as powerful as my old computer, but it drove me crazy. The laptop was like new though and it looked nice. The screen was pretty dim, but I don't need to use it outside so that wasn't a problem. I really wanted to like it, but I couldn't get past not being able to do HW that required several tabs to open at once.","Affordable and easy to use. Love it","This is my third chromebook, purchased only because my second chromebook needed to be up dated!.  Set up was very easy;  no problem transferring all of my files. Definitely a 5 star item, highly recommended!","I like the computer. I have always had a mac so it is an adjustment going well. It is fast and love the goggle chrome. I was off it for a few weeks after i fractured my arm however, one handed I get all done. I believe it was the best purchase especially for the price. Highly recomend","This is perfect for on the go working or google ANYTHING! I have used this for my business laptop and it has a great battery life and fast processor. Great buy!","After just a few weeks of getting this prodeuct, I REGRET of spending my money on this piece of ^%$#. Is not compatible with most of the printers, even ifthe printers or acer say they are, you ll be returning printer after printer. Some basic apps become just a dream on this product, the screen\/cursor gets useles when try to scroll up\/down, and the list goes on and on. DO NOT throw your money tothe trash, DO NOT get a lot of headaches tryng to figure out how you can solve a lot of issues, you ll be just wasting your time and money. For a few extra buks you ll be on the safe side and happy owning a dell\/hp or even mac","so far this seems to do the job I want it to--I don't game so mainly I just use it for a few purposes","Very good chromebook. Easily worth twice as much. Only criticism is that the sd card slot doesn't allow the card to go all the way in. It juts out slightly so if you intend to have kids around or to transport the computer in a bag, it is quite inconvenient. Other than that it's  been an excellent purchase so far.","I wanted a newer model of my older chrome book and this is just amazing. I love the chrome book and I wanted it to have an hdmi hook up . My old chrome book lasted 6 years before the screen went out and it still works if you plug it into a screen with hdmi."],"17":["For 300 USD, I was expecting a high-end Chromebook, with good performance and build quality. And after my order arrived... well I got that high-end Chromebook, with good performance and build quality... for a Chromebook. For a product advertised with a metal build, it isn't wrong, but the only metal on the surface is the center plating around the keyboard and track pad. The top, bottom, and screen cover are made from a cheap polymer coated with silver paint. This is excusable since it's a Chromebook but I just wanted to point out that it isn't all metal. The I\/O is fantastic, as it contains 2 USB C ports, 2 USB 3.0 ports, a microSD slot, headphone jack, and k-slot. It also charges through the USB C slot on the left side, which is just amazing. Performance-wise the device is remarkably better than any sub-500 dollar Chromebook I've ever used. It contains an SSD, so quick boot up times in the seconds were expected. The 4 GB of RAM hits a sweet spot in price\/performance for light work and multi-tasking. And the 2.4 Ghz CPU was able to keep up with the tasks that I demanded it to accomplish. For media consumption, this device gets the job done. The screen is a 1080p (not sure if 60hz) IPS display with adequate color accuracy. For reading articles or looking at photos, the Chromebook does an excellent job. I can't exactly say the same for videos, however, as any video I've watched was defaulted to 720p. I can set it to 1080p but afterwards the device gets a little slow and toasty. At least 720p isn't an unwatchable resolution. On the notions of productivity, Chromebooks were designed to accomplish this at a low price point. The specs are just enough for light multi-tasking, as I was able to run Chrome (3 tabs), Firefox (2 tabs), Google Documents, Microsoft OneNote, and Discord all at the same time. While it's true that Windows or Macbooks are able to accomplish much more than this, those laptops exist at a different much higher price point. Macbooks don't exist new at this price point and the Windows laptops that do are often plagued with meager performance and build quality (basically it doesn't take a whole lot to run ChromeOS compared to Windows). Lots of good points to note but I do have some bad points to point out. First off, the track pad. The track pad is just garbage with poor sensitivity, poor tracking, and poor physical touch. The material on the track pad is glossy plastic and it lacks a matte texture, making it difficult to precisely maneuver the cursor as friction slows your finger down. ChromeOS also only has 5 cursor settings, making it difficult to precisely personalize the DPI. Due to this I had to buy a Bluetooth mouse. Another flaw would be the battery life; advertised as 14 hours, I actually only got 6 hours off at 50% brightness. 14 hours at 10% brightness is probably what Acer was referring to. Final flaw would be the keyboard. Typing on it isn't very grand; it can be argued that I should not expect a good typing experience from a 300 dollar Chromebook, but I felt better keyboards from other 300 dollar Windows laptops. Also I did read some third party reviews from other sites, apparently the Acer Chromebook 15 keyboard suffers from water and moisture problems. As such I would recommend Amazon's recommendation for the silicone Acer Chromebook keyboard cover. Overall I think this is a good productivity device for small business or schoolwork. It certainly punches above its price point while not breaking the bank. If you can deal with the flaws I listed above, I would highly recommend this over any other 300 dollar laptop.","Since 2014, I have purchased five Acer 15 Chromebooks from Amazon. These last two just within the past week. I am impressed with these and love the back-lit keyboard, a new feature for my collection. Wonderful. I can type in the dark when and if I need to. Also, it is an additional perk and aesthetically speaking, very attractive. Another fantastic feature for my needs is the ability to charge my CB from either side. The adapter inserts to the left or the right of this CB. When buying Chromebooks, I look for brilliant screen features that are most important to me and they are, Full HD with IPS technology and  also a must-have \"fabulous audio.\" I love the speakers located on either side of the keyboard and facing up. I love great bass in my music and all my Acer 15.6 Chromebooks brings it in spades. \"Almost\" as good as my separately purchased remote surround-sound system for my desktop PC and the best speakers on any CB I have listened to. The beautiful FULL HD screen display is glossy, not matte which I would have preferred and my 3 previous Acer 15 Chromebooks from 2014 and 2017 have.  I should have knocked down a star for this issue but the top CAN quickly be adjusted when the light behind me is being reflected so I didn't.  You do lose some screen brilliance when you have a matte screen ( anti-glare )  but I got used to it in no time. If you want a matte screen that doesn't reflect light the ACER 14 has that feature but you lose the back-lit keyboard. I am going to wait until the 2020 CBs are available as they have this feature ( matte ) plus a longer AUE date. ( Automatic Update Expiration )  That date begins when the device is manufactured not when you receive it. I have read all of the reviews of this model and agree with all  5-star ones.  I am set. \"Most\" of my needs have been met! Love Acer and love Amazon and love these two new Acer 15 Chromebooks which are working flawlessly.","This Chromebook is just what I was looking for! The 15 inch screen is big enough for my aging eyes, but the size of the Chromebook is still very easy to manage and lightweight. I am a teacher. A lot of my work is done in the cloud. As a Mom a lot of my personal computing is Facebook and online bill play. This computer is great for all of that. The camera and microphone work wonderfully. This computer is an amazing value!","Product arrived on time. Took out of factory sealed box and plugged in per instructions. Turned on power. Nothing happened. Screen completely black. keyboard backlights were on so I know it was turned on. Thought maybe I needed to charge it. Charged it for several hours.....still nothing but a black screen. Looked online at Acer community for support. Apparently this is a problem with this computer. DO NOT BUY THIS!","Works well for all school functions. Can handle having up to 8 tabs open before becoming sluggish. Very lightweight, good battery life, ok touchscreen (not great). The only issue I've been having is with the keyboard layout. It's different than a standard keyboard layout, so I'm always hitting the 'a' when I mean to hit 's', etc.","Really great computer, super fast with lots of storage. The screen and image quality are amazing and I'd definitely recommend this computer to anyone plus excellent service.","I LOVE this laptop. My last Acer lasted over five years and the only reason I replaced it was because it would not hold a charge without the charger plugged into it. Setting this up was so easy! All my bookmarks were already in place, thanks to my Google account! Do NOT waste your money on the setup...you can do it yourself in less than five minutes! My only complaint is that there was no real recommnedation while I was looking at this for a hard shell case, so I posted a question and I got an answer. I ordered a hard shell case based on the user's recommendation, but it did not fit. I did further research and see that there are so many models (read: too many numbers to confuse us!) and finally found one that is supposed to fit this model. It just came today, but that one does not fit either! What the heck?! Does anyone have any idea for me? I am sending back model number AC15-CB415","I purchased this item a while back and am somewhat pleased, however the lack of HDMI ports and the non-cooperation of \"c type\" to HDMI adapters is upsetting (can't connect to my hdmi projectors even with adapters). It comes with google chrome excel, word, etc. I would suggest holding off for a better laptop (i purchased it when acer products were having a sale on Amazon). It lacks some of the normal keyboard keys (delete and caps lock) and also the lack of a right click mouse for easy options. The saving features when downloading files also add onto the headache of easily moving files.","Absolutely flabbergasted for this chromebook. I bought two chromebooks for my daughters for doing so well in school and Amazon was great at a timely delivery. Received both and the first one worked for a minute while I was going through the setup. After I got to the wifi setup portion the screen went black and I couldn't get it to turn on. I called an \"expert\" and they had me check a few things. Long story short, the backlight wasn't working so they had me send it in for a warranty repair. Second laptop worked fine but the touchscreen didnt work. I thought I might have misread the product description so I chocked it up to a misunderstanding. But when I looked up the listing, it said touchscreen, the box said touchscreen... confused, I looked up the model and saw an unboxing video on YouTube and it showed the reviewer opening apps and using the display as a touchscreen. I reset the chromebook to factory settings and restarted. After the setup I tried it again, still didnt work. I didnt want to get stuck with a broken chromebook off the bat so I sent it back for an exchange. Got the exchange (3rd chromebook) in today and I plugged it in, booted it up, lights on the keyboard and everything... but no screen. Backlight not working. The same not working as the first chromebook that Acer had me send back for a repair not working. I have never had this much trouble with anything I bought from amazon. And I have a bachelor's in IT and I work with computers for a living. I am very disappointed and I can't believe that I would get 3 defective chromebooks in a row. I'm assuming acer will ensure functionality for the first one so I'll (hopefully) get to test that one. But this one is going back for a return and I'll use the money on a chromebook other than this model.","I needed a new laptop, and I am so glad I made it this one. I keep finding new things to love--like the MicroSD reader built into the side. That will come in handy on my upcoming trip.","We use Chromebooks in small office setting. We have bought Acers in past with celeron processors and 4 gb ram, and they have performed well. It seems they have changed out hard drives for flash drives or some other technical change has transpired that has dramatically slowed down these devices. We open tab sets with 5-7 tabs at a time.  On our older Acer machines it takes about 30 seconds to load a tab set. On this new machine, it took over 2 minutes. It was worse than the old Acers with 2GB of ram.  Other than that, beautiful machine. Screens are better than the old ones. There is a three star review where he talks about speed too. If you are only using for email or browsing it may  be okay, but if you want to use with Google Drive and multiple files open, possibly with a second monitor, this is a slug. Bad tech design by Acer.","I appreciated the size and clarity of the screen, and it having touch screen functionality. I realized that this has a slower Celeron processor and only 4GB of memory, but loading an initial web page took long enough to be irritating. I found a closeout HP laptop for $70 less that has Windows 10 on it, that seems more responsive. Separate from my experience with this Chromebook, is Amazon's ridiculous returns experience. I walked through most of this process easy enough, until I went to print out the return label. The page then just says \"Print the return shipping label anytime from Your Orders or your email.\"  Never found it. Used their chat tool and also called support, and waited on hold for 20 minutes (would think that a support person would know how to do this without having to ask for help). Anyway, from a web page layout perspective and from a \"let's make this a great experience for our customers perspective\" you'd think they might just have a \"print your return label here\" button on the same page where I just processed the return. It's almost like they want to discourage you completing your return just in case you change your mind out of frustration. Fortunately I live in the Seattle area and can just head over to Bezos house and throw this package thru his window. Just kidding. There is an Amazon Hub near me, and after a google search, I can apparently print a return label there. Not all of us have this option though...","Received this chrome book only to have the operating system crash. Follows the google instructions to reinstall it, which did not help. Amazon offered to have me pay to send it back to Acer. Acer paid the shipping. Don\u2019t know if the fix will work. I have owned the computer for two weeks and haven\u2019t used it.","I'm not into a lot of heavy stuff, so a Chromebook works great for me.  I love the Acer Chromebook!  It was easy to connect to the internet.  I don't use the touchscreen on a regular basis,  (I'm used to a mouse), but it works fine.  My last Chromebook was an 11.5\" screen.  My eyes are not what they used to be and I've found that the 15\" screen is just right.  Fits perfect on the lap pad I have.  The keys have a nice touch with a back light.  Good battery life.  I'm happy with this computer.","I originally have owned only windows laptops and I bought this when it was on the Amazon truck and I am very happy with the switch to chrome book. Kinda iffy getting used to the different features (Microsoft online, a two finger tap instead of right click, etc.) but it works great. I use it everyday and the charge lasts almost 3 days","I love Chromebooks, I had the model from 2 years ago and when I bought another one I chose to spend the extra $20 for the touchscreen. Only thing I don't like is with my old model when the warranty expired I kept receiving updates that would crash the system. I finally got it working right but you can't have more than 3 programs running or it doesn't, I haven't had an issue with this model and the touchscreen is amazing and works wonderful. Also this is the cheapest price I found for this laptop everywhere else it was almost $50 more.","I like the battery life of this device...the touch screen stop working after two months of use... There is no \"delete\" button, no \"right\" or \"left\" click option. Other than those three things I need in a laptop, this Chromebook serves a purpose.... I would not buy another unless they add a delete button, a proper working touchscreen, and a right click option.....the screen quality is great, movies look great on it...it's very responsive,.... I'm unable to cast to it or from it. The volume is great.","I am so glad I got this!  It\u2019s fast!","all good features. 32G hard drive is enough for chomebook. Screen is crystal clear plus it is touch screen which I didn't expect for the price I paid. the processor is quad core which handle regular task smoothly. highly recommended! it is not as light as my daught's dell 11.6 chromebook, but I need 15.6 screen for sure","Even though I knew the dimensions, I was surprised by the screen size. And for the size of the Chromebook, it is very lightweight. Love the backlit keyboard! Touchpad and touch screen are responsive and work well.","This laptop is doing its job as to what I needed it for. I'm a college student attending a university that is using google products, so the fact that this is run by google helps immensely. The downside though, is that I need to draw diagrams for one of my classes. The touchscreen didn't register my finger very well (when I would draw, there would be breaks in the line where it didn't register my finger touch). To counter this issue, I bought a stylus. Upon receiving the stylus and testing it out, I found that the same thing happened. The screen didn't register the stylus continuously either. Other than the crappy touchscreen, it's an overall decent computer.","Screen was great .. Easy to set up... Touch screen did not work... Sent it back","I bought this for my daughter\u2019s freshman year of college. She\u2019s a little rough on electronics and I wasn\u2019t willing to drop real money on something she was going to drop. This laptop is a bargain. She\u2019s able to do all of her assignments and watch all the YouTube videos. It is rare to have something that is completely functional and doesn\u2019t cost a small fortune","it is great experience to use this chromebook for watching video and my favorite shows. The touch screen also full HD is the part I like most. Plus the 4 core process gives very smooth output for such a affordable computer. five star, highly recommended.","Battery isn\u2019t great; forty-five minutes, tops.  But the laptop is a solid product otherwise. Loads super-quick. Programs run fine. Not a \u201cgaming\u201d system and didn\u2019t buy it for gaming either. This chrome book was purchased for college and it has delivered!","This computer is so fast. It starts up immediately. Touch screen is fantastic. Backlit full size keyboard is great. I made a great purchase!","Happy with the Acer Chromebook 15. The blurb suggests the battery will last 11 hours. In practice about six hours. Having said that it's delightful to stream Netflix with a 15.6 inch screen.","Surprised by the battery life and overall quality. Macbook looks at a fraction of the price. Powerful enough to run all apps and a pefect class companion for a student. The build quility is top notch. The only question is Can it run Crisis 3, when Google Stadia comes out?","When I opened the package, I was immediately impressed with the build quality of this chromebook. It doesn't feel cheap at all. Upon turning it on, the screen resolution is quite nice & the computer is fast & snappy when browsing. I was quite surprised about this computer, especially for the more than reasonable price range. Being a chromebook, I know it has its limitations & wont be as good as a high end laptop, but this really just hits the nail on the head for basic use. If you have a young student, this is perfect for them. If you have folks that just need a computer to browse & take care of some online stuff without needing tons of space or power, this is for them. It's very portable & slim design makes it easy to throw in a bookbag or even a large purse.  My 9 year old son uses chromebooks at school & is really familiar with them so this was an ideal purchase for him to have at home!","Very fast. Battery lasts a good while. I was upgrading from a 2015 laptop, so of course I'm going to love anything faster than 5 years ago. Well worth the price! Lots of storage. Works well with wireless mouse and keyboard.  Has office online which I needed for work, Word, Excel, etc. and no problems with remoting in to work with databases, sharing online and such. Will recommend for the price.","The computer I was sent by the seller Niya goods didn't work. I've heard great things about the laptop itself but didn't get to test any of it since the one that I was sent by this seller had an issue where the screen wouldn't turn on.","This is a good Chromebook for the price I paid. It is still a Chromebook and doesn't do much outside of the Google ecosystem, but it's good enough to use for registrations for events with our Cub Scout Pack.","I hate PC's. I only need chrome browse but have access to google play store. Screan is very crisp and clear. Back lit keyboard is fantastic. Wide angle screen viewing. Battery lasts more than 8 hours and charges very quickly. Can charge usb devices wc 3.0 quick charge. Micro sd slot for memory expansion. Two of ports to charge from either side. Very lightweight.","You'll always be denied login and have to verify with a secondary device. If there is no internet connection you can't present at business conferences saved documents. So much for a simple thing.  Screen is nice for streaming.","WOW!  Great Chromebook for the price.  I was not expecting to get a 15.6\" touchscreen for under 250.  This thing does everything I need it to do and will hold a charge for the entire day of mild to moderate use.  I will say the speakers aren't the best, but overall a very solid machine after a month of use so far.  If you are looking for a cheap Chromebook that has touchscreen and is large, this is the one to get.","A wide screen laptop. Nicely designed with great speakers. Light weight and with va brushed aluminum feel. Keyboard is easy with illumination. Good navigation and a good settings icon. Long lasting battery. I like this device to watch my favorite streaming service. Movies and news  channels. I have never used a good laptop as this one.","I had been looking for a Chromebook, the Acer is the best in its field.","The best Chrome Book for the price. You get backlit keyboard, HD touch screen and a very good battery life. If you\u2019re on a budget and want something nice, pick this up. Only thing is it\u2019ll slow down a bit with 6-7 windows open at once, but just keep under that and you\u2019ll be fine.","My first experience with cloud computing. This is great for websurfing or Netflix and chilling, but not for office productivity. I must operate Excel and Word and save files in that format. The extra steps required to download, upload, save to and convert files is too much of a hinderance for me to use this laptop. Gave it to the kid to play Roblox.","Perfect gift for my temporarily bed-ridden husband.","Quit working 2 days after return window closed.","Just received awesome screen quality. I love since it\u2019s not my first Acer chromebook I logged into my gmail account and it automatically transferred many of my saved items. 4 pounds is heavier than I expected when actually feeling it.  Still loving one month later","La computadora anda perfectamente y es una gran maquina para quienes trabajan online y no necesitan guardar archivos grandes y no quieren gastar mucho dinero. La pantalla est\u00e1 muy bien si le das un usp hogare\u00f1o para ver pel\u00edculas, navegar internet. El sistema t\u00e1ctil anda muy bien aunque yo no lo uso porque al tener teclado la pantalla queda algo lejos y el brazo se cansa al usar mucho la pantalla t\u00e1ctil. EL teclado est\u00e1 muy bien, aunque no he podido encontrar la forma de bloquear las mayusculas, ya que no tiene tecla para ello. El trackpad parece algo fragil, pero yo he conectado un mouse. Muy satisfecho con mi compra.","Great screen resolution. Not as fast as I expected. Good value for the money. I use an SD card to save files. Netflix never lags. Apps load easily. Great battery life and low maintenance.","I think this is good for what it is, a cheap way to browse the internet. But versus the laptops I have used in the past, the screen quality is not good and is dim. Keyboard not as comfortable.","For the first time, I feel confident in using a Chromebook for some school projects.  Acer has contributed a lot to the success of Chomebook series.  Keep up with good work for both Google and Acer.  Cheers...","Great for ChromeOS, Android, and Linux apps. My one critique is the dual-core processor is a little under powered. This is a solid computer, especially for the price.","the screen died after a few weeks and i never use the thing. it's in a drawer and i don't use it anymore","i am very happy with this CB - the battery life is extremely good - the display is awesome, very clear & the resolution is very tight - light weight & slim - i would recommend this CB to a friend - i didn't rate the touch screen bc i never use it","I love this Chromebook.  It's very lightweight and has good battery life.  I purchased this particular model because of the larger screen and keyboard backlight.  The keyboard feels slightly smaller than a standard laptop.","This computer is easy to use and has a great screen. The sound and blue tooth work great and the apps are easy to download with good wifi. I really like the touch screen. The only concern is that there isn't a caps lock and the keyboard is a little weird.","I bought it loved it immediately. Only recently did i discover the touch screen.","Computer is fine.  I just learn that it is not compatible with my Cricut.  I should have done more research on it.  So now I have this computer and not able to use it for what I intended it for.","Bought this for our grandchildren as they use Chromebooks in elementary school.  Good price and great look.  Screen is very clear and sharp.","I'm pretty happy with this. I needed something to carry around for when I'm working remotely and this fits the bill. For the price, I doubt there's anything better out there! The screen quality is excellent in comparison to other Chromebooks I've used. The machine itself is quick, stores charge well, and hasn't shown any processing issues.","Bought this two days ago. Arrived today. Took out of the box, charged for about 10 minutes, powered up. Only to find the screen doesn\u2019t work. Called Acer for tech support, did the troubleshooting and was told to send it to them to repair. Nope, I\u2019ll be sending back to amazon and buying a different brand.","Does the basic job well. The browsing is reasonably fast.","I love Chromebooks- this one is the best I ever bought- Great screen and sound system cranks!","Well worth it\u2019s price. It is an awesome laptop and I love it so much.","Havent used very much yet.  Love it so far.","Very please with purchase. Working Awesome","Has all the features of a much higher priced laptop! Lightweight, screen looks great indoors, love the back lit keyboard!  This is a must for Google lovers \u2764\ufe0f","So far love it. Very clean and New.","Have had it for 2 months, so far it works fine. I had one already but it didn't have the touchscreen or backlit keyboard. However, this one does kind of lock up when doing certain tasks I have noticed whereas my old one didn't.","My new Acer  laptop is great.  Fast charging, long battery life, & quick response.  My only dislike is that there is no number pad on the keyboard.  Overall I'm very happy with my purchase.","I hate this computer. If all you want to do is play games and surf the net, it might be okay, but for anything like real work, it's useless.","Really pleased with this purchase","I bought this for my son to use at school and absolutely love the battery  life!","Good brand name reliable product under reasonable price.The tough screen is a great feature to have.","Just feels like it could be a bit better.","I can't seem to get an answer as to why the box had been opened if this was a new product.","Meets my needs.  Works great so far.","Perfect and simple to use. Great value","Replaced a Samsung with it because I wanted a bigger screen. I love it. Guess what everyone is getting for Christmas.","Love it","Big Bangs for the buck","This laptop runs slowly","Turns on and off and opens up pages very fast. Great images and good size screen for viewing pictures\/movies.","Love all","Easy to use - compatible with Google Family Link, so it's easy to limit the time spent on it","Love the price!! Also the touch screen, battery and it\u2019s light weight too!","This can do almost everything my PC does.  The SSD drive loads everything a lot faster than my PC.  True, it the hard drive is only 32GB, but I was able to add a 256GB MicroSD Card for storage. The manual doesn't mention a size limit for the SD card, so if 256GB isn't enough for your storage needs, you can go higher than that. After a bit of fidgeting, I figured out how to save files on the SD card instead of the internal hard drive or Google Drive.  Yes, the purchase of this Chromebook gives you an additional 100GB on Google Drive.  However, I'm old enough (in my 60's) that I don't trust the Cloud.  The default setting saves your files to the Cloud, but it's fairly simple to change that setting  Just click on the clock (lower right side of the screen) > the Settings wheel > Downloads.  You can either set it to save in a specific location every time or ask you where to save the file.  I chose the later, just because I have several different folders for downloading files.  Another thing I like is that there's an app that mimics MS Word, so I can save files from my PC to the Chromebook using Bluetooth. I use the File App (a blue circle with a picture of a file folder inside the circle) to open files and determine how much free space I have remaining on the hard drive, USB drives and my SD card.  You can also use the File App to create new folders (for instance, creating a new folder for every year in the Photo Folder, then creating a new folder for each month in each year's folder). The one thing that bothers me about the Chromebook is that I can't put icons for the various apps on the desktop (like I do on my PC -- I called Acer's tech support and asked).  I can put them at the bottom of the screen -- Chromebook calls it the Shelf.  There are two ways to add your favorite and most used icons on the Shelf: * Drag and drop, or * Right-click on the app with your mouse and click app icon, then click \"Pin to Shelf.\"  To find all your apps, click the small circle on the lower left of the screen, then click the caret (^).  All the apps you've got on the computer will show up there. The reason I don't like not being able to use the desktop to store my favorite icons is that I have more than will just fit in a single row on the Shelf.  I also don't care much for the keyboard, but that's because I prefer my keyboard to have more of an audible click to it.  It makes it easier for me to touch type.  However, I didn't ding the stars for that because I know other people will prefer a more silent keyboard, especially when there are other people in the room watching tv while you're computing. The battery life depends on how you're using the Chromebook.  When watching videos, it lasts about 6 hours.  If I've got the Chromebook in standby mode (like my PC going to sleep), it will last about 12 hours.","So far so good easy to set up love the back lit keyboard","Chromebooks make life easier. Excellent product","Excellent quality","Great chromebook for web browsing and checking email. Quick and responsive.","This thing weighs a ton, is not a traveling laptop","Nice and sleek, fast and sharp image. Very satisfied with my laptop!!","A really nice laptop for casual usage","Just last week I was bemoaning my 10 year old laptop which is a dinosaur and so slow! So imagine my glee when I was offered this Acer Chromebook 15 laptop to review! So first off, of course it's WAY BETTER than my old laptop, so I won't compare it to that, I'll compare it to my relatively new work laptop which is an HP. I lifted this Acer laptop out of the box, it's fairly light, and plugged it in - and immediately the WELCOM page came up and then it was just a matter of following the prompts and logging into my Google account! I am not tech savvy AT ALL, so this was immediately reassuring. It will take me time to discover all the joys of this new laptop - I know I will love the touch-screen and I'll get used to the touch-pad \"tap\" instead of \"click\". Anyway, I feel I'm in the 21st Century for sure. And the PRICE! Well, it's half of what I paid for my old laptop 10 years ago! That's the way technology goes, \"better, faster, cheaper\"!","I ordered the Acer Chromebook 15, Intel Celeron N3350, 15.6\" Full HD Touch, 4GB LPDDR4, 32GB Storage, Google Chrome, Pure Silver, CB515-1HT-C2AE, 15-15.99 inches so that I might have a lightweight portable travel laptop to enjoy and use for travel and at home. I have had some time with the new Chromebook and I would like to share a few thoughts and experiences with this particular model. The first thing that I noticed with this Acer Chromebook was how thin and lightweight it was. It reminded me of a Macbook, though I have never owned one. I love the silver metal look and the keyboard is very enjoyable and comfortable to use. The speakers on either side of the keyboard are nice and sound amazing considering the size and the fact that they are housed in a very thin and compact space. Initially I did experience some issues with the screen where it would not turn on despite the fact that there was power. It was very random but about 80% of the time the display would not turn on. I was able to contact Acer and they did resolve the issue within a reasonable amount of time. I had to send it back to Acer and they replaced the mainboard which I assume was the culprit. As I type up this review I am doing so on the repaired Chromebook and I have to say that though I had that initial experience, Acer made it right and I absolutely love this product! I\u2019m not real savvy with the Chromebook OS but it really is simple and I appreciate the fact that this model comes with a Micro SD slot for my 128gb card which will come in handy to use for loading some movies and or music for on-the-go. Also it will come in handy for loading a few photos to edit with my favorite mobile photo editing app using the excellent touch screen which I quite enjoy. Speaking of movies I have played a bit with Netflix, Google Movies and Hulu and the video quality is quite amazing with the 1080p screen resolution and, as I mentioned earlier, the sound is surprisingly loud and clear. Battery life has been pretty impressive and lasts much better than I expected. As I stated before, this has been my first Chromebook experience so the only thing I have to compare battery life with is my much larger gaming laptop which I can't even get a few hours of use before I need to plug in. Overall this Acer Chromebook 15 has been quite enjoyable, and because of Acer\u2019s great support, I would highly recommend this Chromebook if you are looking for an inexpensive well rounded mobile \u201cLaptop\u201d experience.","The original concept of the Chromebook was a technically lightweight internet\/web appliance without the usage, knowledge, and maintenance complexity of typical home computers of the time.  Aimed at those with similarly lightweight needs like simple browsing and email, it was ahead of the curve on cloud-based apps and storage.  Way too far ahead, unfortunately, as Chromebooks barely survived their introduction.  Cloud functionality, availability, and pricing has come a long, long way since then, to the point where it\u2019s unusual to find someone who isn\u2019t using the cloud.  Moreover, Chrome itself has become one of the most widely-used browsers, Google apps (g-suite) incredibly popular and powerful, and the Chromium OS platform itself has become attractive as a deployment base.  Microsoft is even porting its Edge browser to Chromium.  So the ground has shifted from the Chromebook being the odd machine out to a very capable alternative that gives up little to nothing for many people ... and not just those with lightweight needs any longer.  The OS & Chromium platform and Google apps coupled with cloud storage are completely mainstream. Acre makes a large variety of Chromebooks, the CB515-1HT-C2AE being roughly in the middle of their price range, which spans from about $200 - $800, street prices.  Memory and local storage is more than adequate as long as you are dedicated to using cloud storage.  The processors don\u2019t compare in power to those of more expensive laptops, but then, they are a fraction of the price. Build quality is excellent.  Design excellent.  Screen Excellent.  Usability - excellent and instant. \u201cInstant.\u201d  What does that mean?  That means my 18 year-old granddaughter was functional on the Acer inside of 15 minutes of opening the box.  And she\u2019s thrilled with it. Contrast that with my new MacBook Pro ($3k plus).  I was three days in to *really* complete the set-up.  Now the needs are entirely different.  I\u2019m typically running 15-20 simultaneous apps, 4 different browsers each with a dozen or so tabs open, a VM with Windows 10, and have software development tools as well as photo editing needs.  The thing is, BOTH Windows and OSX are capable of being taken to this level (and far beyond).  It\u2019s that extensive capability, configurability, and extensibility that contributes to the support issues that plague so many people.  ESPECIALLY those who don\u2019t need it! A Chromebook simplifies the entire situation and considerably lowers the cost besides.  Google\u2019s apps are superb for most.  (I use them as well.)  And the Acer is well-regarded.  I\u2019ve owned Acers before and still have one of their newer laptops (a Windows 10 machine) as well.  Acer - like a Chromebook itself - is a mainline choice.  The CB515-1HT-C2AE has been stable, it\u2019s fast when run as intended, and it\u2019s fun. Highly recommended and should be on the short list of anyone who doesn\u2019t have niche or heavy processing needs.","Just shy of being a Luddite, I can add no real useful information about this product to the detailed reviews here.  All its specs are on the product page and also mentioned in the better reviews.  So I'll just say why I like this. Since I don't do anything complex on computers, a Chromebook works well for me. (1)  Almost instant start-up, no waiting around for it to boot up like my PC.  I'm not a patient person, so this is a great feature. (2)  Battery life is relatively good, but even better is the fast recharging time. (3)  Big, 15-inch screen.  This is great for streaming videos and movies.  And the image is quite sharp.  Of course, the trade-off for this large screen is that the Chromebook itself is a bit too large for convenient portability.  I just keep this at home. (4)  Easy-breezy set-up.  Takes minutes.  All you need is a Google account. (5)  Sound is good. (6)  Keyboard is backlit.  That's a very handy feature for me. (7)  It's touchscreen.  Another handy feature. In general, this is a good Chromebook.  It has the same strengths and weaknesses of most brands when comparing them to a PC.  But, as I said before, I'm just barely computer literate and this meets my limited needs well.  YMMV.","I've been wary of Acer; I've had desktops and laptops by that company have some significant issues. I really don't feel like they're built to last. So, when I got a Chromebook a few years ago, I got a Toshiba, and I love it. She's still running strong with no issues! I got this Acer to review it; I really do like it a lot, but it will be interesting to see how it plays out in the long-term. The Acer is quite large. I like the smaller size of my Toshiba, but if you want a nice, beautiful (HD) screen, the Acer will not disappoint. The screen is a touch screen, which I don't find useful for my purposes, but others might like that feature. The sound is great, as well. If you haven't used a Chromebook before, it may take a little getting used to- there are some different keyboard buttons, and what you can do with a CB is a bit different compared to a desktop\/laptop. However, if you are used to using a CB and are just looking for something new, I'd consider the size. Again, this is a pretty big Chromebook--maybe that's what you want, or maybe that will cause you to think about something else. Overall, the CB functions well and has a good battery life. As mentioned, the sound is great, and the screen is crisp and clear. It's a great machine--I just hope that as an Acer, it's as reliable as my Toshiba has been (which I'm not getting rid of by any means- just making a comparison!). I've had bad luck with Acer before--maybe this CB will change my mind!","My daughter uses this laptop for all of her school work, and she loves it so far. The touch screen is really responsive, and the screen itself is huge. The screen is also more clear than other chromebooks we've had in the past, easier to see because it doesn't have that weird anti-reflection finish. But even though the computer is big, it isn't too heavy for her to lug around. And it's fast. We haven't had any trouble with lagging. My only minor complaint is that the track pad can be a little touchy. It does the job, but compared to, say, a Macbook, there is a world of difference. We've had this issue with every Chromebook we've had, though, and so we are used to it. This isn't as nice as a Macbook obviously, but it is perfect for a younger kid. It does everything it needs to do, and my daughter can use it to research, write, access apps, etc. It's exactly what we needed it to be.","So, my first encoun ter with a chromebook was a few years ago. I was not pleased by the smaller size keyboard that my hands could not adjust to. Other than that, though, I didn't really have any issues with it. Upon considering this purchase, I went back and forth between this and a tablet combo form another maker. I had a few friends discourage me from the chromebook, suggesting that it was too limiting. However, given my needs, I don't see any limitations at all. I use it for emailing, streaming subscriptions, composing in googledocs, updating my websites, and of course, shopping on amazon. It allows me to do everything my old laptop did. But this is faster, sleeker, and the touchscreen, I suppose is an added feature for some, but I find that I don't really use it. Anyway, I'm very satisfied with this product, and, if that changes over time, I will update this review.","I typically do a lot of research on the go from my phone. I am one of those people who has a million tabs open for all the things I'm either in the middle of researching, need to come back and research, or things I want to hold on to for later. Although I still do that, I finally got to the point where I wanted to have a bigger screen to be able to see things better and be able to type with a keyboard instead of the small keyboard on the phone. So when this Chromebook was up for grabs on Vine I jumped on getting it to try it out. Visually it's great. The subtle back-lit keyboard is super nice for laying in bed without the lights on and still being able to see what you need from the keyboard. The metal look and feel is also very nice. The matte finish is perfect for keeping clean and not leaving smudges all over. It also hasn't been uncomfortable to type on. The keys are very smooth and quiet (perfect if you're a loud\/angry typer like I've been told that I am, lol) so the fact that it's quiet is nice when people are around and dont want to hear you typing. The screen size is pretty amazing, as is the quality being that it's 1080p HD. It has 2 USB type C ports (one on each side), 2 regular USB ports (one on each side), 1 MicroSD slot, a headphone jack, and a k lock spot. The sound quality when listening to music or watching videos has been great as well. The only complaints I have are with the following: 1. Battery Life - it states that the battery life can be up to 12 hours, but so far the longest I have gotten out of a single charge is about 6 hours. I'm assuming they rate it at 12 hours if the screen is dimmed to the lowest setting, but I'm not about to strain my eyes. I like mine around 50% brightness. 2. The other thing I'm not very fond of on this book is the center mouse pad. It's not overly sensitive, so it's a little difficult to maneuver over to select things on the screen. I will definitely been needing to get a bluetooth mouse. It also has the left click button built into the pad, but no right click, so again definitely need the mouse. You do have the ability to scroll up and down from the mouse pad, which can be beneficial at times seeing as though it doesn't have a page up\/page down buttons. I can't say I'm by any means disappointed with my Chromebook. It's great for easy every day use. And for the price it far surpasses all expectations, and performs much better than other brand Chromebooks I've looked at. It would be perfect for students or someone who doesnt need all the other applications from a regular laptop. I did check into being able to install Microsoft products and there is a version you can purchase for Chromebook, so I will most likely be doing that to kick up my usability.","I'll be honest, I don't know a lot about specs, megagertz or hertz or whatever, technical stuff. So here is a 57 yo woman who just got it out, plugged it in, and made it work. Usually I have my son or husband set things up but I wanted to see if I could do it, because believe me, if I can, you can. It was easy to set up, and easy to use. It's pretty fast, we are running a megablast network thing through cox so that probably helps too. It took me awhile to adjust to all google all the time, google docs vs microsoft office, but I did. the biggest thing I love is all the apps I can use, that I don't use on my phone because of the small screen. The keyboard is responsive. It also has touch display. It says a 12 hour battery life, I get about 11, maybe I leave it one without realizing? no biggie, it charges quickly It has all the memory I need so far. I've had no issues with it other than a little learning curve, barely a bump in the road really, I mean google and find the answers quickly. A very good chrome book","I\u2019ve used a Chromebook before, but it was much smaller than this one. This one is pretty cool, and offers just about all you would want from a regular laptop. I have to say that I love the larger screen. After playing around on smaller screens for years, it\u2019s a delight to have a big and absolutely beautiful screen to work with, especially as one grows older. A lot of the things I need a laptop for, for instance, using Office, Word, or Excel, you can do on a Chromebook and store your files in the cloud instead of on a PC or Mac computer. Starting up this baby was really easy. It took a minute or less to get me to a browser window and up and running. The internet speed seems ramped up from what I\u2019m used to, living in a rural area. I\u2019m amazed at how quickly the web pages load. It also includes touch screen, which is pretty awesome. I recommend this Chromebook not only for all that it offers, but also because of its price, which is very reasonable for what you\u2019re getting.","I had a Chromebook years and years ago while I was in school and it was a great basic computer. I will say they've come a long way since then. This one boasts a fantastic touchscreen and a really cool feature of being able to lay flat which is great for collaborative projects. I'm also impressed with how much more useful this laptop is from an entertainment standpoint. The two up facing speakers make a noticeable difference in the sound. My last Chromebook the sound was pretty pathetic but this one sounds legit. It's perfect for streaming or even light gaming. The keyboard feels good too. Overall for the price this is a fantastic laptop.","Not that long ago that I would have scoffed at the thought of buying either any PC from Acer or any Chromebook. My perceptions of Acer PCs and Chromebooks weren\u2019t positive. I remember checking out Acer PCs that traded expense for quality. The ones I knew were cheap and slow. My Chromebook experience was based on buying one. I lost money when I sold it shortly after because it had performance issues from day one. Flash forward to recently when I received this Acer Chromebook. The first thing I noticed was the size, much bigger than my first Chromebook. Second, after setting it up, I was surprised at the speed. It literally takes just seconds to boot up. I\u2019m using the Acer Chromebook more often than our almost as new Windows PC. I like it more and use it for almost everything. There was a time that I could have made a list of reasons I had to have a PC. Now, the only reason I\u2019m not choosing my new Chromebook one hundred percent of the time is because of one software program. It\u2019s personal finance software that I\u2019ve used for over a decade. I\u2019m ready to ditch it now when I decide on which app to use that provides the functions I need. Everything else, I\u2019m accomplishing through apps. This Chromebook\u2019s 34GB of built-in storage is plenty, especially since everything on our network syncs and backs up to shared cloud services. When I can finally only use my Chromebook and get away completely from the PC, I\u2019ll save money by canceling our subscription virus protection. The Chromebook comes with it at no additional cost, including regular protection updates. I love that any of the personal and business related doc, spreadsheet, picture, slide, etc editing I did on my PC, I can do on the Chromebook. It\u2019s big 15.6\u201d full HD screen lets me see more without scrolling. The screen is also a decided plus when streaming movies and TV shows. The built-in camera and speakers are as good as any I\u2019ve had on a regular PC. If I could change anything, I\u2019d add a cover for the camera for when it\u2019s not in use. Also a built-in microphone for using Hangouts or Duo to video chat would be nice. To anyone thinking of moving to a Chromebook, I can tell you it\u2019s not a hard thing to do and I recommend this Acer for its performance and stunning looks.","I've been using Macs most of my professional life, but my phone is Android, so getting up and running on this laptop took very little time. It's turning out to be a great tool for my illustration work as I can add reference to my Google photo collection from my desktop or phone and then call them up in my studio on the chromebook and I'm good to go. I was using an old iPad but this beastie is so much sleeker, faster and BIGGER (but not too big), with a nice hi-res screen. Having ready access to my Google drive, documents and email in the studio is also very helpful. I'm trying to use this mainly as a work computer but it's great for having movies and shows playing from our streaming accounts when I'm working for more than a few hours and need entertaining background. The touch screen isn't *quite* as responsive as that of my Moto G4, but it's a minor difference and doesn't cause any problems. The keyboard is comfortable and responsive but I mainly use the touch screen except to type. My main quibble is that I cannot get it to recognize my bluetooth speakers or headphones -- the same devices my Android phone has no problem with. I've tried various workarounds but nothing has solved the problem. Apparently this is an issue with Chromebooks. It's frustrating and I hope it can be fixed, but it isn't a deal-breaker. The sound from the internal speakers is decent enough for background while I'm working (but I'd rather be able to use my headphones). Aside from that it's been a great little machine.","Excellent laptop. Super fast start up. The sound is decent. Screen quality is excellent. Holds its charge all day long. Charges back up quickly. It's not the type of laptop you'd want to use for gaming or for installing lots of stuff. It is what it is. Great for email, web browsing, social media, and watching videos.","This is my second chrome note laptop. Golly  I love it. everything a computer should be. Fast, saves your works . password saver and google docs. Easy up dates do not crash your computer! Since I had an older version chromebook , after I logged , the new machine talked to the great cloud in the sky and loaded everything I needed from my old lap top. No more long transfer problems.  I use it mainly for shopping and business and vacations. It does have usb ports, so I can hook up my track ball. I do not like the small pad if you have not made the switch, trust me you will be happy--- you will need a google account to make it work.","A decent laptop if you don\u2019t plan on using it for business or designing. Perfect for browsing, email and streaming. I was hoping it would be compatible with my Cricut Design space software but it is not. I found the touch screen to be sensitive and easy to use. Much faster then using the mousepad. The laptop is extremely thin and lightweight making it perfect for travel. Overall I would recommend this laptop if your looking for a sleek, fast and reliable laptop.","So this chromebook is good. It is sleek, compact, and works great! However, it's not a full laptop.  You can access the internet on it and browse pages, check email etc. It is not a gamer pc.  You can't download programs onto it. Or at least I haven't figured out a way to download programs onto it. But, for browsing the internet it's great! The battery charge lasts awhile and it's portable to lug around with you.","Their is very little to dislike about this item. It has a great physical presence, being an above average looking book. Internally, it has above average components allowing you to do everything expected. We've had no problems and nothing but good experiences with it.","DON'T DO IT!!! DON'T LISTEN TO THE OTHER REVIEWS, THIS COMPUTER IS THE WORST. the only good thing about this computer is the expected battery life, which is accurate. everything else is absolute trash, trust me. you will NEVER have enough storage space, it will NEVER properly sync up with your Google Drive, after 4 months of use it'll begin crashing every time you so much as try and fill out some feedback about how horrible this damn device it. don't get it. save up some money and get a proper laptop, preferably one with more space and an actual operating system.","This laptop is very light and easy to use. Love the touch screen. It is very responsive. The display is very clear. The keyboard is easy to use. I really like how easy it is to take it with me and use. The speed is very good and it works well for all of my needs. I highly recommend this laptop.","If you're looking for a lasting notebook, this is not the one. The keyboard will eventually start falling apart, and sending it to get repaired is so expensive that I rather wait for either Black Friday\/Cyber Monday deals."],"18":["June 17, 2019: ASUS support tells me that I must send the machine for additional test\/repairs. UNACCEPTABLE. The tech I worked with over a month ago told me that if the problem returned my machine would be replaced.  I will not send this back in. The only acceptable resolution is replacement. I've lost literally months while this machine went back and forth to the ASUS repair facility and I'm still stuck with brick.  I will never buy another ASUS computer. This is literally the worst computer purchase I've ever made and I've been using these things since the late 1980s. June 13, 2019: THIS COMPUTER LITERALLY CAME BACK FROM THE REPAIR FACILITY FOR THE SECOND TIME LESS THAN A WEEK AGO and the issues have returned AGAIN. I'll never buy another ASUS product. This is garbage, the brand is garbage and I just want my machine replaced or money returned. This is absurd. If I could give this machine a negative rating I would... I've brought my rating down to one star. You can see my original review after my update. Update: The problem with the fans grew worse. I tried updating all the drivers and this failed to fix the problem. I contacted support and spent about thirty minutes walking through the issue with them. They issued and RMA and I sent the computer out for a warranty repair. My computer was out for about three weeks and when it was returned to me, the problem was alleviated, but only for about a week, at which time the fans gradually spun up more and more frequently and for longer and longer periods of time.  Right now, the fans have literally been running, and they are VERY LOUD for the past two hours. I'll close the laptop and the fans will spin down, but within half an hour, they spin up again. The computer actually woke me up last night when the fans kicked in (with the laptop closed). I spoke to support again, and this time the agent told me the behavior was normal. Okay, right. In addition, this computer's track pad is the worst I've ever had.  It's almost unusable. I regret purchasing this machine. It is absolutely the worst computer purchase I've ever made. Original I bought this computer primarily for a mobile DAW. In general, it supports everything I do in terms of audio recording and editing. However, there's a couple caveats I feel I must share with others. 1. The fans are running for no apparent reason. They are tremendously loud and in fact they've been running since I turned on the computer 5 minutes ago. I've disabled all but the essential startup items and currently I am running only Chrome. No other applications are running. The computer isn't even warm. It's really annoying. I was one version behind on the BIOS, so I flashed it with the latest. No change. 2. The track pad isn't great. Sometimes it's weirdly sensitive and mistakes a scroll for a click. Other times scrolling is difficult (it will scroll smoothly and suddenly stumbles requiring that I move the cursor to the side and try again. If that doesn't work I just go to the scroll bar and go from there. So while the computer is suited to my needs, it's drawbacks are very frustrating. I'm considering sending it back.","i bought the rtx2070 512m2 16gb. I would give it 4.7 stars if i could. its a great laptop but its not perfect. If you plan on playing games you really need to buy an extra stick of memory with the 16gb model. Games will run mediocre without it but ur frame rates will increase 90-110% when you add the 2nd channel (depending on the game). Shadow of the tomb raider averaged 50fps with med-high settings with 1 channel, it jumped to over 90 fps with ultra high settings. Resident evil 2 remake went from 60-85 to 105-144 (cus vsync probably) on highest settings. It's great for work. The 144hz panel makes everything look smooth. I got lucky, my panel only has a little light bleed in the corners and can only be seen when the screen goes completely dark. Fans are loud. Use headphones. The speakers are pretty good, u need to turn it up really loud to over power the fans.  Panel is not gsync.. but 144hz so doesn't really matter. update: Worked great for about 3 weeks. Then the graphics card decided to disconnect itself from the computer. Couldn't find it in bios. My guess is high temps probably loosened a solder joint. I still like the computer so i ordered a replacement.","The pros: 1. Beautiful screen 2. Solid build 3. Easy to upgrade (ram or storage) 4. The speaker sounds great 5. Easy to monitoring the basic information by software and control the fans and colour of the keyboard (Armoury Crate) The cons 1. Touch pad not big enough 2. Fans maybe too loud when overboost mode 3. Blue screen issues (I think it\u2019s just a individual problem but it\u2019s happened when I play game) When I playing game, this laptop provide a beautiful display and good sound quality to me to enjoy. Unfortunately, my laptop seem have something wrong (software or hardware problem), it always blue screen when playing game and I try to fix it (e.g. update the driver or windows) by finding the solution on internet but the situation still happen. Another problem is after I install GeForce Experience, it might have a weird colour dots randomly appear and the laptop might going to freeze or blue screen. I returned this product and it delivered to return center over a weeks but I still waiting for my refund. Unlucky and Disappointed experience I shops on amazon!","The good: Initially pleased with product at unboxing.  Was pleased with minimal bloatware (except McAffee which comes preloaded and pushy). Device has a cool appearance. Easy to change backlit keyboard colors etc and overall solid construction. Snappy responses for basic apps. The Meh: It is a large, heavy laptop. At the outer edge of what I consider portable. But fine for my purposes which don't require constant movement. Screen quality is very average. The Bad: On the 3rd startup the network adapter failed to appear. Device basically showed that no wifi card was installed. 2 hours of troubleshooting and ASUS support recommended I return it. Also, while it was working I ran some basic diagnostics and performance. While CPU appeared fast, graphics and overall performance did not equal the sum of the parts as I expected. Perhaps if I had it longer I could have tweaked.","I tried to like this laptop. The fans are loud like most laptops. Its so loud it disturbs others in the same room. The battery is horrible just like other gaming laptops. This particular laptop kept crashing during gaming at random times. Also, apparently it has a RTX 2070 graphics card but I can only play many of my favorite games like BFV and Anthem with Low-Medium graphics settings and even then its buggy and laggy. Not sure if my laptop was defective or what but I know that's not normal. I have another computer with a 1070 and I play BFV and Anthem on Max settings so go figure. Long story short I returned this laptop very quickly. My laptop was the version with RTX 2070. ***Edit: March 20 2018: I returned the laptop very quickly like I said and unfortunately even though Amazon has had it for 2 weeks I have still not received credit for the return even after reaching out to them 3 times. They assured me several times that the credit will be issued in 24 hours but I have still yet to receive it so I had to make a payment on my credit card because of this! Unacceptable business practices Amazon \ud83d\ude24","Purchased this guy to upgrade from an ASUS GL-502VM. The build quality is leaps and bounds higher. Virtually no deck flex and feels super solid. The screen quality is good. I do wish it were a 1440p display and\/or it had G-sync support, but at least it runs well at 144Hz. As with other nVidia laptops, if you hook up a G-sync compatible display via DisplayPort, it works. The NVME SSD that it comes with isn't incredibly fast compared to the Samsung 960 EVO that I replaced it with, but it's still faster than SATA. Speaking of SATA, it does come with the ability to add your own 2.5\" SATA SSD. Comes with a cage for it, and a special fiddly ribbon connector as it doesn't have SATA data or power ports on the motherboard. Not very difficult to install, but it does require a careful touch to not mess up the ribbon connector's latch. More about upgrades. You can upgrade the RAM. At least partially. Opening the back gives you access to the M.2 slot, SATA drive and 1 DIMM slot. I'm not sure if it has 8GB soldered to the motherboard, or if there's a 2nd DIMM slot on the other side of the motherboard. The speakers on this thing are fantastic. They produce a lot more bass than I initially thought they would. They fire out the right and left sides around the bottom of the keyboard so they aren't easily covered by hands. They can also get quite loud without distorting or vibrating the chassis. It took me a while to figure out the Aura stuff for changing the keyboard lighting (and disabling the light strip on the front which I find kind of obnoxious). The CPU and GPU are both fantastic and keep cool, as well as keeping the keyboard cool so it's comfortable to game on for a long time. Keep in mind that unlike the Pascal cards, the mobile variants of these Turing cards are not identical to the desktop cards. They have a bit less SU's and are clocked a bit slower. The trackpad is glass as well as having separate right and left click buttons. It uses Windows Precision drivers as well. It still has some troubles that I can't seem to work out yet (sometimes input is ignored for a second or two), but most people probably won't use it too often. Overall, I love this thing and will probably continue to use it for several years down the road.","The design is superb, very stylish and eye-grabbing, without being tacky. The RGB keyboard is great, although I have to play around a little bit more with the settings to see if there is individual colour backlighting on these, the marketing materials do not seem to mention it. It's a spec beast, that's for sure. It feels super smooth while using most software for video editing and graphic design. Would have liked to see a GTX 1060 instead of a GTX1050 Ti in here to take advantage of the 120hz screen in more games, but it does the trick for the MOBA games I usually play. The screen is gorgeous, and quite an upgrade from most laptops in the price range. Colours are accurate and great for both work and gaming. Highly recommended if purchased at the right price.","I was super happy with this within the first 24hrs of receiving it. I\u2019m a 3d artist and I found this laptop ran my primary programs smoothly without too much of a fuss. And then I went to close the lid at work after a long day at the grind... and I noticed the screen was peeling back from the casing and the glue. Since I want this laptop the most I\u2019m going to give it a second chance with a replacement. Did amazon send me a referb when I ordered new?","I honestly thought due to the review and the price this computer would work well. But ive been having more and more issues with it. Ive had it for a little less than a year now and ive had to factory reset it mutple times just so i could open some files. It good at the begining no problems, then everything kina goes to crap. My led keyboard has malfunctioned multiple times and the ROG gaming center is just all over the place. I constantly have to look up how to resolve stupid issues. I give it 2 stars cause it was great at the beginning. Honestly though i would not suggest this laptop to anyone. Hope this helps, wish there was someone to tell me before I spent 1200$.","This laptop works incredibly well and I'd give it a much higher rating if it weren't for the fact that it constantly freezes. It has had these random freezes for a long time now and I haven't been able to find the cause or any pattern to when they will happen. It makes doing any work or gaming on this computer very difficult. Other than this, the computer is actually very well-built with a vibrant monitor, but I cannot give it a higher rating.","This is a great MOBA laptop.  It has just the right specs.  The 1050TI is a perfect fit for MOBA Gaming.  I like how the QWER keys are highlighted on the \"Hero\" edition unlinke the usual WASD.  The 120hz is nicely done.  This is a keeper. DOTA2 and Heroes Of The Storm HotS.","I received the package last night in San Diego and after charge it for over 3hours and try to turn it on the screen was blank meanwhile the keyboard light was on, what is going on?","I\u2019m not saying ROG is useless or anything, but the laptop I received have A LOT of problems. Just transferring files from my old laptop caused WiFi disconnection and device not responding which I can only fix it by resetting this laptop. When gaming, fan noise is VERY loud so I turned it to silence mode, which caused \u201cYour PC ran into a problem and need to restart\u201d Btw, in my own opinion, go buy a hard drive and extra RAM since the one I bought doesn\u2019t have that much storage for my Steam games(only ~500GB, not their problem) and the keyboard lighting doesn\u2019t work properly","My device had very minor backlight bleed but not enough for me to make a deal of it. The laptop is spec\u2019d out with some of the best components on the market. Enough RGB to light up the Western Hemisphere, jk. All in all, a great performer. A bit hot on the thermals depending on the games played. Only game that makes me really worry is Black ops 4, thermals seem to get pushed really far when I play that game for some reason. Other than that most other games I play are around 80 for both cpu and gpu. Laptop is fairly thin for gaming standards at around an inch give or take. So if you\u2019re used to a ultra book it might be a bit of culture shock for you. I paid close to 2k when I first got in March but this laptop generally sells for around 1.5k now or close to that which I think is more than a great price. I would recommend this laptop if your looking for something that handles thermals fairly well and a more than decent built in keyboard. I actually game with this keyboard by default since I have a full size desk to expand my layout and that\u2019s one of the reasons why I haven\u2019t sold this laptop is because most thin and light devices have worse chiclet keyboard with no travel.","I needed a laptop for heavy video and photo editing that I could see lasting several years. I am not a gamer so the clear WASD keys and \"Republic of Gamers\" everywhere are somewhat annoying however worth the tradeoff to have a laptop that can keep up in Premiere and Lightroom. The price on the ROG Strix II was the best price to anything remotely comparable (2070 graphics card). I also purchased a 2nd 16gb memory stick along with a 2tb Samsung EVO SSD which were both very affordable. Any off the shelf comparable spec laptop I researched with these simple upgrades were much more expensive. Also I saw all of the negative amazon reviews and realized they are mostly about the old 1050ti model so Tom a chance and I'm glad I did","Just got this laptop no less than 5hrs ago and it\u2019s already a wreck. The screen is flickering every 20 seconds...I\u2019ve already had to reset my computer twice and lose everything on it...trying to boot the laptop on safe mode only made things worse by making the touchpad lose connection to the laptop. All on day one. Unbelievable and inexcusable. Trying to return ASAP. Do not buy. It seems like instead of being the lucky few to get a bad unit, you have to be one of the lucky few to obtain a good unit. Also I sent this laptop back in about 6 days ago and still haven\u2019t been contacted by Amazon to tell me my refund has been initiated...I\u2019ve had to call them multiple times already and they \u201cdon\u2019t know what\u2019s happening\u201d nearly $2000 and they don\u2019t have the respect to give you back your money promptly. Doesn\u2019t matter how many times they \u201cthank you\u201d for being a prime member. They take your money from you in less than a second, but they don\u2019t even want to answer your calls when you\u2019re expecting your own money back.","This laptop is absolutely amazing - for the first 6 months. Please keep in note I've had this laptop since December 3rd 2018 or around that date and I was putting a review on hold to test how long this laptop can actually LAST. I treat my laptops like children, I air dust monthly, wipe down with screen safe cloths, dont remove any of the components or overrun this beast. It's an excellent gaming laptop, but it can get a bit hot sometimes so I bought an extra fan to go under it to keep the interior dust free and more cool when I ran heavy games. Most of the time I dont run this thing to its max because it's a nervous feeling hearing it give it all. I dont move this laptop much, if I do, I never, never drop it. So what happened? Well for starters, the laptop started to get a bit funky after 3 months, when I did add a little pressure to the system and play heavy games (Max settings on FFXV or Archeage, GTAV I never dared) it would unexpectedly blue screen and pop off. At first I was like \"Well okay I'll just lower everything, keep it on resting modes and no run it as hard next time.\" Which worked, up until the next month where the CMD prompt would randomly spasm on the computer. Thought I had a virus and ran multiple security checks on it, turned out clean, left it alone. Finally, the 6th month comes around, the screen just loves to black out frequently. Everything else is working fine, it runs and I even hooked it up to another screen to see that the computer itself is all good but it was literally just the screen causing issues. This is the week that the screen never even bothered to come on, and I believe the screen is faulty after awhile for this particular laptop, as I've been reading up on reviews myself. No, I don't have warranty for this laptop as I know that I treat my laptops with the absolute care and protection than I probably do other living beings. So here I am stuck with a dead screened laptop that I wouldve thought would last a year minimum and over a thousand dollars lost.","So pleased it arrived on time. The screen has a very beautiful resolution. The boot is too fast, I like too much the speed or the memory. It would be better if had more memory rom, but I can buy an external hard drive so it's ok. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact I had to did a lot of system updates. I recommend a lot this computer, if you wanted a high quality pc for multitask and gaming this is a really good one.","This is a very powerful laptop. I have had it for about a week and the gaming experience and overall user experience is top notch. Playing Overwatch and Call of Duty online without and hickups or screen tear. Even while I am downloading content in the background , my gaming is super smooth and the keyboard is responsive. I suggest if you get the model that comes with only 1 16gb stick, buy another 16gb ram stick and install it BEFORE you turn on windows for the first time. I had some errors before but this time it worked perfectly. Also adding HDD \/ SSD takes a careful hand. Not the easiest SSD install but it's not too bad. And the cable for the SSD is in the packet with the ROG sculpture, just have to look throughly. The reason I give it 4 stars is because the Armory Crate software which controls the RGB keyboard is terrible. It works whenever it wants to. And when I try to customize it keeps crashing, so for now I have it on just 1 single light until Asus implements an software update. EDIT 12\/01\/2019 There was a software update for the armory crate so I can now customize the 4 zones as well as the light strip on the bottom and the logo on the lid. You can individually customize them. However it still freezes up at times and you can change anything.","Its a laptop, to start off. Don't buy this thinking it will be anything like a Desktop gaming machine just because it has RTX and 9th gen intel processor. You can play some newer titles, but most of which will not be running at 120fps even on the lowest settings(Unless its a game with an adaptive resolution which I personally, will never use as I'm not a fan of playing games where its just pure blocks. I'll play Minecraft when I want to play Minecraft). It doesn't have a webcam which some may dislike and has a single input where many people still use a mic\/headphone jack. The RGB is nice but can be annoying if you leave the laptop plugged in overnight as it will be flashing red continuously. Had a few issues where it would continuously reset the color and not keep it which is better now but still sometimes has this issue. The first game I tested with this was Dead By Daylight, which stuttered like crazy on the lowest settings. Which to be fair, its a terribly optimized game. While playing I felt as though my mouse was lagging and the inputs were delayed? I ended up switching mice, two models of the g502 (wired\/wireless) and the issue persisted. Each mouse click felt delayed by up to 250ms or so. This is not normal, couldn't find anything on this so I said whatever and tested a new game, had the same issue. Stick to non-competitive games :^) The armory crate software from Asus is nice for people who want a quick download\/install of updated drivers and software. Overall, a nice laptop. But I would highly advise against this for gaming. I was actually amazed at the CPU performance for encoding - Using NDI with OBS for encoding you can use this laptop as a two computer setup if you so desire. Then simply throw the laptop in your bag and head out. Minus points though for the horrible battery life - Idle, balanced battery the laptop died in 2 hours with nothing running.","The laptop is good for the price and has a really nice material quality (feels sturdy). Battery is on the rather weak end of the laptop and the display of 120hz kind of goes to waste with newer titles(It is intended twords mobas wich works perfect) as this laptop will not be able to display 120fps in games like Shadows of War. The 128gb ssd feels rather useles(on bigger titles) and would preferred paying 100 usd more for a 500gb ssd instead. Speakers are rather nice but earplugs will most definetly be better and the microphone\/webcam of the laptop are nice as they are. Asus global warranty does not cover many countries so if this is a deciding factor you should check Asus international warranty country cover list before purchising it. For the money you pay this is a good budget purchase.","I was looking for a budget laptop to edit 4K footage. I hate the look of most gaming laptops but this one isn\u2019t too flamboyant. This thing easily powers through any video I want to make in Davinci or Premeire Pro! The only things I dislike about it are the touchpad and the display isn\u2019t the greatest! Great laptop for the price!","Honestly... the computer works fine.. Older model works better... but hte fan is so loud and constant, it is really a bother!","I know it's a larger laptop, to fit a 2070 regular & improved air flow. Even then, the whole experience is pretty clunky. The gaming performance was worse than a side-by with a 2080 Max-Q Razer Blade (on paper 2070 regular outperforms 2080 Max-Q, so this shouldn't be the case). The touchpad loses contact with finger very easily, so you're vigorously trying to get the pointer from A to B. Bloatware sky-high! I counted 15 unnecessary ASUS apps (not including Windows bloatware, and not including ASUS Crate which is valuable). I'm keeping 3-star because it's fine for the price, other gaming laptops are ~3k. I'm returning actually because the speakers don't work. It's barely audible 95% of the time, with spikes of regular-volume 5%. Likely defective product, if this was only issue I'd return for replacement rather than refund.","Overall, this is a great laptop with the only real downside being it is a little loud depending on what applications are running. This can be easily be fixed by creating a new profile through the Armoury Crate and changing the Hyperfan DC or AC to Silent depending on whether you are plugged in or not. If you are used to using gaming desktops, this will likely not bother you and otherwise it is a very powerful laptop that is also quite light for how powerful it is.","So I've had this machine for a few weeks. Overall I've been pretty happy with it. It looks great, feels great, performance is fine. However, just a few weeks in I'm already experiencing some problems. I've blue screened a couple times while watching Netflix\/Hulu (none while playing games), and now this morning I blue screened just on the desktop. On top of that, now my machine isn't even displaying my RTX 2060 in device manager and the fan is running at 100% speed even on silent mode. This is eliminating me from playing any games at the moment. Unfortunately I'm more than likely not going to send off for repair. The thing is a few weeks old. I'm more than likely just going to refund completely and look for a different machine at this point. You only get one chance to make a great first impression.. Only a few weeks in and having these problems? What about a year from now when all warranties are over? I'm not getting stuck with a $1600 paper weight.","I was an owner of the Lenovo y50-70 and after 3 years that gave out on me. I was hunting down a new gaming laptop and was struggling between a pc or a laptop, but knowing how well the Rog Strix 503 was going for I wanted something similar. I noticed that the Hero 2 was pretty good, with the light up led and the difference in color for the MOBA keys it was nice. The weight is pretty light and the size is great. No overheating and better yet it gives you an option when playing a game to record your game play. I've had this for a month now and I've had no regrets but instead more things that has blown my mind.","Trackpad? Doesn't work about 1\/5th of the time. I mean that seriously, 1 out of 5 times I touch the touchpad, it doesn't register a touch, or will register it in 3 or 4 seconds, after I've already moved it. Audio? A mess. The built in speakers try to self adjust, but just go back and forth between really quiet, and kind loud. Want to use headphones? Well that's a crap shoot too. Just gotta restart the audio drivers until it starts working. Those lovely leds in the keyboard? It came with 2 different pieces of software to manage it, and neither worked completely, with BOTH unable to set a STATIC COLOR. How?! That's literally the simplest setting! Installing tried 3 different utilities from Asus by themselves, and have only found one which lets you set a static color, or disable things like the rear logo light. Even that one doesn't work for the music or other sync functions. Leaving the keyboard on it's default rainbow mode still freezes from time to time. I really have no words to describe the rgb implementation. Windows comes with a bunch of bloatware for \"gaming\" or \"security\". Most want money, or data. It's strange, because the Asus software is not bad, and I actually would have appreciated the OC program they provide, if they hadn't jammed 5 other applications on the machine. The monitor is quite strange, and changing the refresh rate is difficult because of Intel optimus taking the reigns from Nvidia. Intel control panel is just slow, and I have no idea why. This also makes external monitors really weird because they run on the GPU and DO use the Nvidia software. Oy... This is important for going mobile to save battery power, and it seems to have some software that tries to change refresh rates when on battery, but again it's pretty unreliable. I would send this back, but with all the shipping costs and wait times I may just sell it and buy another model laptop.","Its ok im still getting used to it . It has a decent screen its pretty vibrant . Actually good sound from the bottom firing speakers even has bass. I dont like the keyboard i mean its fine but ive used better . The I absalutely hate the trackpad it feels like your sliding on ice i feel like i lose control when im using it . It stutters i hate it . I Dont like the that the laptop is pretty heavy i didnt expect that even though it doesnt use metal at all its like plastic albeit very high grade . The fans arent as bad as people think its usually not that loud .  IT cools it very well thats what i like. No thunderbolt 3. One more thing I what super annoying is that this laptop comes with only single stick of 16 gig so single channel .i had to add a stick of ram in there that i had from a previous  laptop. The battery is okay is u will get 3 to 5 hours doing normal things but gaming will be at 30fps . When u connect to charger u get get tripple the performance wich is good if ur trying to reach that 144 hurtz of the display wich feels super smooth and very very quick response time . The camera is crap. One thing i really wish is that the screen was a tad brighter and more accurate .  Especially how heavy it is im wondering that probably this isng goot for college students.","Fantastic gaming laptop. The keys are perfect. The screen resolution and refresh is fantastic. The LED's are a nice touch. PRO - I've been able to play the most recent games on ULTRA with the RTX 2060 (6GB), so the graphics are awesome and with the refresh rate it's very smooth! CON - The speakers are junk. Realtek HD Audio Manager has changed, and amplifying the on-board speakers is difficult. Eventually went with a third-party program (FxSound Enhancer) to boost their output. Bottom Line - Fantastic laptop. Worth every penny.","I like this ASUS Laptop. It is light enough to take on the road when I travel. It packs a credible punch when gaming. I play BF5 and D2, and other FPS games that require a lot of memory and GPU power. I replaced the 512 PCIe NVMEx4 with a 2TB PCIe NVMEx4 bought here on Amazon, and I added a 16gb RAM stick to give me full featured dual channel capability. You can't go wrong with the price to performance this laptop gets you.","I don't know if I just had bad luck, but my D key came poorly installed , I only had the laptop for a month and the D key pops out constantly and does not stay in. I talked to ASUS about sending me a new key and hinge, they said I would have to ship my laptop to them, and that doesn't work for me, since I cannot be without my computer , because it is also for work. Other than that, the laptop does become extremely loud when gaming and very hot, but it runs most games on medium settings pretty ok.","I'm in love with this laptop, but unfortunately I'm returning it. The display is beautiful and crisp. It runs beautifully. Unfortunately, it's had some issues that I can't get past. I've only had it 1 month. - The speaker immediately started going out. I was able to get it turn work when I restarted the entire laptop, but it just goes out again. I eventually just accepted that there was no point. - Sometimes the track pad starts going crazy. Sometimes it doesn't work at all, and sometimes it will work fine but then continually stop picking up movement. I requested a return, only to be told I have to pay for shipping. What the heck?","I used this for gaming. Afther countless hours updating bios, updating drivers, undervolting underclocking the computer was unable to utilize a full performance on games because it was THERMAL THROTTLING LIKE HELL. Out of the box all CPU cores was hitting 99 Degrees. No matter how much you undervolt it is not able to disperse the heat and gpu and  cpu was throttling. That's why people are doing repasting and trying undervolting all over the places. IT IS RUNNING AT 90 degrees still at simple games like dota.Dont make me speak of BFV. Constant throttling GPU even throttling to %50 usage and not beyond. This is a scam by Asus selling you a 2 level below performance gaming notebook for the money of 2000 dollars. Absolutely terrible.","First review on Amazon ever... it's just such a terrible product that has faced problems left and right. All-around a massive disappointment, especially considering the price. One day you have audio problems, the next you have a random blue screen (just 4-5 months from purchase, mind you). The laptop even overheats, which is understandable, but it reaches temps of nearly 100 degrees celsius (with a cooling pad, and cool ambient temperature). It has a very nice 144hz monitor, backlit keyboard, and that's about it for positives. The cooling is very bad, the laptop seems to be defective, and it has 1x16GB of RAM (end user should upgrade with a second stick, dual channel improves performance significantly in many instances). In short, if you're set on buying a decent laptop, just buy a Lenovo, HP, Acer, or even an Alienware\/Dell. Asus really flopped with this one.","I bought this for school project since I have to work with CAD program. When I received the box, there was a seal tape over an old one and it made me think asus just ship a returned laptop to me. I think it\u2019s still good to use until I notice the bleeding screen and battery life was not good. It might be the reason why it was returned? When I received it, it had no battery left. It is abnormal because when I bought any new machine, it should have a little bit of battery in it. I checked and all the operated program was installed on Feb 2019. The advertise from amazon is misleading since it states processor is 3.9 ghz for i7 core but the truth is the machine is slow. It keeps loading when I run solidworks. When there is no program running, the temp is around 49 C deg, and battery keeps eating up too much. Hence, I return it to buy a better laptop.","Have had this laptop for 1 day, I really like it. A 1-day review is usually frowned upon but Im going from a high end pc (1080 ti, 7th gen i7, etc) to this for work related reason and this thing is really impressive for a laptop. Its geared toward moba's but offers more than just that with the 1050 ti built in, and the 6 core i7 8th gen is a really great aspect. I can have a lot going on with a very slight lag that doesnt bother me (unclocked). I havnt played any games yet that are graphic intensive but my geforce program auto set a lot of my really nice games that are mostly about the scenario to mostly high settings with some being really high\/ultra. Everything about the laptop feels nice. Im glad I bought it.","The first one I received had some weird screen issues so I sent it back. However amazon offered a full replacement so I\u2019m only taking off 1 star. This laptop is incredibly powerful and I love it. The fact that we can now have a desktop class gaming experience on the go is so awesome. The cooling system while loud keeps the thermals in check and I have yet to experience any real throttling. Overall an awesome laptop if u get a good one","This is a great piece of hardware, packing a hexacore i7 and an RTX270 with monitor running at 144Hz. This laptop outperformed my main gaming desktop and convinced me I needed to upgrade to a better GPU\/Monitor setup. I used it for a weekend long LAN party. It ran everything (Apex, SC2, Overwatch, UT4 etc.) on highest settings without missing a beat. It's a great gaming machine that rivals the likes of Razer's Blade at a significant discount. Opted to return this model in favor of the 17.3\" version. For a weekend of gaming like I used it for, I'll be a lot more comfortable with the extra 2\" diagonal. But everything inside is exactly what gamers will want. Not a fan of the \"camo\" print across half the keyboard area. Looks tacky, and definitely solicited snarky comments. Personal preference though.","This laptop performance is stunning - its the best value for money after a lot of research I did! In addition, Light-speed fast delivery!","Holy smokes make sure you check your RAM (I used cpuID). They legit put 1 stick of 1333mhz 16gb ram in my config with an rtx2070... Are you kidding me? Not impressed with the cutting of corners. Don't be fooled by \"16gb\", they literally could not have installed a worse config for 16gb in this machine... I had to change nvidia settings because my benchmark tests were using CPU graphics (not a big deal). I'm also battling an issue with framerate; online pool of tests for an rtx2070 show OW high settings 1080p with average of 180fps, and I'm barely getting 120fps on medium settings (with fans all the way on). If I can't find the issue I will probably return it.","I was looking for a computer to replace my 2011 alienware r15, and im very happy with this purchase. First product i bought from ASUS and im not disapointed after a month with my laptop, great product.","Got this for AIT, it works for everything I could ever need it for and then some, I like to play games so I made sure to get a gaming laptop instead of something plain, this has met my expectations and then some. The only negative thing I can say about this is that it came in single channel mode ram, I'm actually glad it came with only one stick of 16 GB because I'm all about over kill, 32 GB Ram, its a flex. This is my first gaming laptop but I'm sure all gaming laptops completely lose all power when it comes to gaming unplugged  so I can't be mad.","Its an awesome laptop, got it during prime day and its a beast it handles everything you throw at it and more. My gf is a dj and does a lot of music and sound editing so she really squeezes the juice out of that laptop and the laptop doesnt even break a sweat. Asus rocks big time. want another one for myself","1. Abnormal cpu power line noise, \u201czi zi\u201d !!! 2. 14 percent buttery loss?! 3. Fans run fast few seconds and run slow and run fast again and again. Some problems with fan management mechanism!!! 4. Extremely short battery life!!! 5. Back panel has a light leak. 6. You have to buy another RAM if you wanna play games cause there\u2019s only one 16 GB RAM in it. You need double channels to improve performance. You also need another hard disk since 512 is small for 3A games. 7. The laptop is a little Clunky and the fan noise at turbo mode is extremely loud, as loud as a thin razer blade. The price is fair but the build quality is not good as a ROG","My son bought this for gaming. It is excellent for that. The battery life is okay, but with the higher end specs on this you are not going to get all day. ++ Important to note ++ there is not a camera on this. If you are looking to video chat, you will need to buy and a web cam. The plus side is you won't have to worry about some evil internet thug highjacking your web cam and posting pictures and videos of you in your tighty whities! Overall really good gaming laptop!","The RGB logo is super cool! I am also very impressed by the weight of this gaming laptop.","Bought the computer and now returning in 4 days later. The RTX graphics card is not detected by the computer tried all the \"fixes\" that online and asus support has given. Really disappointing that I wasted my time to get a computer that cant even find its own GPU.  The asus support did give me something that did work tho, return it to amazon. So thank you amazon for sending me a defective product.","I'll start the review by saying that the unit I received was likely defective, and that I understand things like that happen despite a company's best effort to have it not happen. The unit I recieved made an odd buzzing sound whenever the screen was not stationary (mouse moving, things loading, video playing etc).  Asus told me it was likely due to a defect, Google tells me it's a common problem typically caused by interference of some sort with the GPU.  Never heard of that happening on a desktop which is more my style typically, but I wanted a laptop to use for work\/game when I travel. Returning this unit and ordering a Razer Blade, costs a bit more... but there seems to be a reason this particular model is so cheap for what's inside.","This laptop is great for college student. It's not heavy as expected. If you want to play games with high quality or study, this is the one. I don't know for other laptops. My laptop has errors on mousepad. When I am studying without a mouse, mousepad is sometimes lagging or does not move. Also, when you are playing games, the fan sound is pretty loud and heated on the keyboard. If you are playing with gaming keyboard, gaming mouse, headset, you won't mind with those problems.","I update my computer and it constantly rain into black screen problems. And then the gaming performance becomes terrible. Can't believe I am running a 6 FPS(yes, 6, not even 10) on this gaming laptop??? Gonna return it later.","It is quite good and the weight is manageable The screen is good for gaming My only issue is every once in a while the system asks me to restart the laptop for some speakers issue which is kind annoying","I loved this laptop, it has all the specs mentioned in the description and with a lot of function keys that make gaming a lot more enjoyable. You even have a key to change the fan speed to be silent, moderate or over-boost which I find awesome when playing games.","Great laptop so far, been using Asus since my first computer and have never had an issue. This one is able to tear through every game I have thrown at it. The only two problems I have with this laptop are light bleed in the corners of the screen, which is pretty dissapointing for the amount of money you are spending. The other issue is it can get pretty loud when playing more intense games.","Major light bleeds at the very top of the screen right out the box. Sent it back and awaiting a replacement. Got a replacement and it works perfectly, plays all my games on almost full ultra everything over 60fps with 32gb of RAM and a new faster NVme","I bought this laptop two months ago and it doesnt start anymore.. the seller didn't respond and didn't give me a solution when I did a claim. The laptop make like a loop start and it doesn't work.","This is the first time I bought an expensive laptop and I was disappointed with the quality. Mouse right click don't work. Installed additional stuff no help. Cam and mic having problems during online video calls. Heats and blows too much. Uncomfortable.","I am not a fan of the drivers and support for this product. I have had blue screens for the graphics drivers, issues with the screen repeatedly going black as it switches between gpus, and constant reminders for audio driver updates.","can't even hit 200 frames on counter strike global offensive. my i5 and gtx 1060 gets more fps than this laptop...","I bought this computer in march of this year.  It works great can do amazing gaming on it. However by June the computer kept booting to the bios.  I had to send the computer in to ASUS and they had to replace the harddrive.  They did not update the warranty from time of repair.  The repair process was mostly painless. I only used this computer for steam and email  and I would not  recommend this product to others, as a 2k dollar computer should not critically fail in just 4 months of light-moderate use.","bought 3 - have 3 kids, now they can all game together.

Even when the GPU is not being used, the fan goes to 7000rpm, making a huge noise. It happens several times during the day. Posts in the ROG forums and comments here shows that other people are having the same problem. ASUS support didn't help at all. They want me to send the machine for repair, but I live in Brazil and local ASUS doesn't offer support for this laptop. I would need to send it to USA, but shipping would be too expensive and I use this laptop for my daily work. I'm 99% sure this fan problem is a mix of bug in the BIOS + drivers + ROG Gaming Center. Unfortunately, it seems that I will have to buy another laptop, but you can be sure it will not be an ASUS. ---------------- Original comment: I bought this notebook while my daughter was in USA. Since I live in Brazil, she brought it to me 2 weeks ago. I'm not a gamer, I'm a software developer, so I need a fast machine to do my daily work, and gamers notebooks usually fits this requirement. I was an ASUS fan back in the 90's, when I used to assembly desktop machines with parts from different brands. ASUS was my preferred brand for the motherboards in that time, so I supposed that ASUS notebooks would provide the same quality that I was used to, back in those days. Well, it seems that my expectations was too high. The machine is fast, of course, but I faced two problems that I would like to share:  When you \"click\" in the touchpad, it is like there is something loose inside that hits the plastic chassis mostly where you stand your wrist, causing an weird sensation. The other problem is a \"high frequency\" noise coming from the notebook when the CPU is under some load. I searched the online forums, and this sound seems to be pretty common in ASUS notebooks, and they call it \"coil whine\" sound. It seems to be harmless, but very annoying. The loose touchpad also seems to be common for those notebooks. Unfortunately, ASUS warranty does not cover Brazil, so seems that I'll have to live with those problems. They are not showstoppers, but they should not exist at all in a quality product. Another problem was regarding the (mostly useless) ASUS support. I replaced the original SSD with a (higher capacity) Samsung EVO 970, meaning that I had to do a fresh install of Windows 10. I downloaded all the drivers from ASUS site, but I wasn't able to install the touchpad driver. In the end of the install, it always raised an error. I contacted ASUS support by chat, and they gave me all kind of useless answers, like installing ASUS live, send it to RMA (in my case, this would not be possible), etc. I was sure that there was no hardware problem, since the touchpad worked fine in the bios setup screen, and also worked fine in the pre-installed Windows on the original SSD. It took me more than a day digging into forums, etc until I finally found that I had to install the Intel I\/O driver before installing the Precision touchpad driver. This wasn't mentioned anywhere. This solved the problem, but I wonder how ASUS support missed this information! So, I wonder if buying an ASUS notebook was the best choice...","Very good laptop from a well known reliable company. Easy recommendation. Also easily upgradable, would highly recommend buying a 2.5inch hdd with it! Performance is outstnding.

The Battery life is okay for a laptop this cheap (I got around 3 hours of heavy use on a full charge), and the charger is so small it can fit in your pocket. The 0.3mp webcam is absolute trash though, so if you're planning on video chatting with this thing, don't buy it. EDIT: I forgot to mention that it comes with Windows 10 Home in S-Mode, but you can easily disable S-Mode for free by going into \"Settings\" -> \"Update & Security\" -> \"Activation\" -> Select \"Go to the Store.\" under \"Switch to Windows 10 Home \" -> click \"Get\"","Great cheap laptop.

This limits productivity and if this was properly advertised I would not have purchase this computer.","I am quite pleased with this little laptop. However,  people who are not comfortable with installing a clean copy of Windows 10 (or upgrading the ram to 8 gigs) will be dissatisfied with this laptop. It has so much bloatware installed that the computer runs extremely slow. (I am talking turtle slow, go get a cup of coffee, make breakfast, and come back to find the computer is still thinking about doing what you are asking it to). Even just simple web surfing is annoyingly slow. There are two choices: either upgrade the ram to 8 gigs OR install a clean copy of Windows 10. You cannot uninstall the bloatware as it has been integrated into the installed Windows 10 operating system. These are your only two options with this laptop. Once I realized that I could not uninstall the annoying bloatware, I decided to completely format the hard drive and install a clean copy of Windows 10. Luckily I already had a copy of windows 10 so I didn't incur any additional costs. If you don't have a copy of windows 10 and don't want to purchase one, then your remaining option will be to upgrade the ram to 8 gigs. If you can do this yourself, it will cost about $40. If you take it somewhere for this to be done, you should plan on spending around $100-ish. Once the bloatware issue is resolved, this is really a great laptop!","The only thing positive about this laptop is that the graphics are good and it's sleek lightweight design. It took forever to setup because it is extremely slow and unresponsive.  Felt like I was back in the dial-up days. It is going to be returned. Shame on me for thinking a brand new computer would perform as well as a much older laptop. Will by a refurbished one instead.","The installed operating system is Windows10 S. The 'S' means it behaves in a very restrictive way. You are only allowed to use Microsoft approved apps from their store and do only Microsoft approved things. It is possible to upgrade to standard Windows 10 'home' (free) or 'pro'(purchase) but there is little reason to do so. This is simply not a game machine and surfing the net and watching movies you can do with the 's' system no problem. There is a builtin camera and microphone with their increased risk of 'loss of privacy'. On the face of it, you cannot enter the bios in order to install a different operating system. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE.  If you are computer savvy and go to lenovo's website and find the Lenovo manual for this specific laptop, and read it; you can change all of that. I am currently booting to, and running Linux Mint . This is exactly what I wanted; a cheap but modern laptop with Linux mint installed for general internet browsing and movies but without Microsoft telling me what I can and can't do or watching me do it. It's my wife's laptop and she is visually and physically impaired due to a stroke so no need for a game machine. The HD resolution is perfect for a screen of this size. Also, with Linux, there is almost no chance of anyone accessing the camera or microphone Snowden style.","This unit does not have touch screen. Do not purchase this computer because if you do they have defective built in batteries which require you to return the entire computer with all your confidential information.  Plus if that battery dies so does your computer and it cannot be fixed.  User be warned.","Overall this laptop is above average for the price range. For starters, it takes less than 5 minutes to change it from Windows 10s mode to normal (You're even given a prompt as soon as the initial setup is complete), otherwise it's just a 10 second google search. For the specs, it can run any simple task like YouTube, email, word, etc. with ease. The system also comes with an SSD rather than a disk hard drive, making boot up much quicker. There are a few cons that do prevent it from being a 5 star product however. First, the battery life is relatively low, only getting around 2-3 hours doing light-medium work, so if you're going anywhere, make sure to bring the charger. Second, the mouse-pad is off center, which is bad for lefties like me (you're gonna have to buy a mouse or get used to the awkward positioning). Lastly, there is significant bloatware issues upon setup (McAfee, Lenovo apps, a billion Microsoft apps, etc.) making the computer slow at first, but once everything is uninstalled, it runs much smoother. Overall, it isn't a bad system at all. Many of the issues can be rectified with little to no money, and for it's price, I would definitely recommend it to people who want a college\/business\/recreational laptop, but do not want to break the bank. (note: for gaming, it can run simple games like minecraft, Roblox, LoL at 35-45 fps med-high settings. For more demanding titles, it is powerful enough to run a peer to peer gaming software like Parsec)","When opening the Laptop, and setting it up, i was surprised on how light it was. We all own lenovo laptops in our household, however this one was a let down. Pros: Very light weight Seems to have a fast processor Cons: (and these are major ones, especially if you love customizing your laptop to your liking) Comes with windows 10s mode. This means you cannot download any apps online unless they are in the app store. Therefore, any software, browsers, or general downloads that you usually run on a windows pc is blocked. - The screen is dull... i mean really dull. Even at the highest brightness setting, it still looked as if it was on low battery mode. - Innovation is lacking, as it is almost identical to similar lenovo laptops, but just slightly slimmer, & lighter. Overall, id pass on this one. If your a student and need a laptop for programming, you may be limited on what you can install and run on the laptop. However, lenovo offers turning off Windows 10s mode, but if you do so, it states that you can not get it back.","It's a decent laptop and it does a nice job in basic computing like Internet, email, etc. It's not your \"speed demon\" and not a \"gaming machine,\" but it's fine for a student or somebody who doesn't do much more than web browsing. The screen is fine and the keyboard has a nice feel, but it's not back-lighted. Webcam is fine for video chats and the touch pad is OK. In short, it's a good basic laptop and the price is right. Now we come to this AWFUL Windows 10 S mode. For those not familiar with S Mode: some new computers (including this one!) boot to S Mode when you turn them on for the first time. In Windows 10 S mode you cannot uninstall  anything from your new computer and you CANNOT install anything not made or pushed by Microsoft. Lets say you want to install you favorite web  browser. Not so fast! Windows in S Mode will tell you that you already have a wonderful Edge browser and will not let you install one of your choice. Most people do not like this S Mode and Microsoft says \"OK, switch to regular Windows 10.\" To do this just click here, then here and then here and that's it. Well, it took me half a day clicking \"here and here.\" I followed Microsoft instructions to the letter, but my new laptop stayed in S Mode. Then after probably 25 tries, it suddenly worked and it booted into normal, regular Windows 10 and it's fine now. So, you might be lucky and your new laptop will switch from S Mode to regular Windows right away, or you might have to fight with it, or maybe you'll like S Mode (I cannot imagine who would like it...) To make this long story short, this particular laptop is fine as long as you manage to switch it from this silly S Mode to regular Windows 10.","I bought this item lenovo laptop on Jun 17, 2019, thelaptop will not turn on  a few months after that On Aufust 26, 2019, still covered under manufacturer warranty, the question is where do I send the laptop to get fixed? CI called lenovo tech support I was told that 1 have to pay $34 -$  99to ship the laptop to get it fixed eventhough the lap top only 3 months old and still under warranty what a lousy tech support they have. The worst exp I ever had. The worst tech support I will not recommend lenovo to anybody. Please avoid lenovo youwill regret it for your entire life.","I bought this as a family computer for my elementary age children to start working on. Overall this has been a great purchase so far. Set up was super easy-- but I did have to switch out of S-mode right away, just to download my printer drivers. I cannot see the value in this mode since it seems so limiting to only select apps from the microsoft store. But it was easy to turn off, the computer even gave me a prompt to do so when I tried to download an unapproved application (my drivers). The CD drive\/burner is the best part-- and why we selected this model. For my kids programs, this was a must. They have also loved burning music onto CDs-- we were doing this on Day 1. My only complaint is the screen. I knew it wouldn't be amazing since it wasn't full HD- so this was not a surprise to me. The contrast between blacks and whites is poor-- mostly the black just looks like dark grey. Not a deal breaker, but really the only negative I have. (and my kids don't care!) I would definitely buy this again and recommend for anyone using it in a similar way. I did not find the computer to be all that slow (especially working online- plenty fast, though loading new programs did take a few seconds) but my husband bought a single stick 8G memory to upgrade- so that is an affordable option if that is important to you. Even upgrading the memory, I couldn't find more value in another laptop- especially since the CD drive\/burner was a priority for us.","Buyer Beware! This is a limited version of windows!  Just spend 4 hours on the phone with Microsoft tech support who couldn\u2019t get it to run normal windows. It came with a limited \u201cS-Mode windows\u201d and wouldn\u2019t switch to normal windows. Returning","Not bad for the price, but there were some issues. The biggest is the Lenovo DVD app for playing DVDs kept crashing. I remedied that by downloading a free player that was stable. The keyboard is atrocious. I purchased this thinking that it had the same, superior, keyboard that my Lenovo T400 has. Sadly it does not. Yes, it's a step up from the \"chicklet\" style keys that Apple made in vogue, but not by much. If you are looking for something inexpensive to browse the web and are not ready to commit to a Chromebook, this is probably a decent choice. I do recommend that you lower expectations (especially is a quality keyboard for touch typing is important to you.)","I can't believe how nice it really is. This was a refurbished unit. I challenge anyone to see the difference.","What a pleasant surprise. First thing I did was use windows activation to remove S mode. Tested internet speed on WiFi and it was slow at 50mg download but I have 100mg service. Go to device manager and updated atheos WiFi card driver and now download is a fast 100mg down. Installed chrome browser and classic shell to for win7 startup view. Allow protection on C drive to enable system restore and create a backup. Viola, this PC starts up within 30-40 seconds and is great surfing the internet. Two thumbs up!","I guess you get what you pay for. This laptop was used to begin with and I foolishly thought that because Amazon would stand behind the product it would be a good purchase. Wrong, setup is not friendly and I couldn't understand two support personal at Amazon so help was non existent. UPS here I come.","This was advertised with Windows 10 Home, but they sent it with Windows 10 S . Windows 10 S only allow Apps \/ Programs from Microsoft's Store only. Now you can get it released to Windows 10 Home in the settings. But you will need an account with Microsofts store in order to get it converted. It's free but to set up an account they want your e-mail, name and date of birth and you have to agree with their Terms of Service 1st . Unless you already have one set up . Now I only let people know to make an informed decision on what it involves. Otherwise I have enjoyed using it for light work, no gaming stuff. But I found that the screen, touchpad and keyborad to work great. It has a light to let you know your Caps Lock and Numaric lock are on. I wanted one with a DVD R-RW so this fit the bill .","Much better than expected.","I had to send my computer back after working with it for a week, trying to get the functions to perform correctly, such as the touchpad not responding and requiring use of a mouse, and bluetooth that never did work, even though devices were shown as paired with the computer. I did not believe that the kind of errors that I encountered were worth trying another unit, as my recent experience with a bluetooth mouse was incredibly bad, after two tries to reconcile the defect. Overall, I thought the speed of the unit was adequate, but the functionality of having all the USB ports on the left side of the computer was awkward, especially for using a corded mouse.","Not enough memory or graphics to run an app for my college classes, which was the only reason I bought a new laptop. I had to return it! It put me a week behind in my quarter of college, what a hassle.","I hate windows 10 for many reasons. This laptop was made for windows 10 only. It was very difficult to install windows 7, but I finally did. Linux mint runs fine on the laptop.","Worked fine for 4 1\/2 months then, plugged it in (to a surge protector - as I had many times before to charge), heard a \"pop\" sound and . . . laptop is dead. Does not turn on. Surge protector is fine, shows no issue. Laptop was still under manufacture warranty but, in reviewing the warranty return\/repair instructions, decided it was too much effort\/cost to bother to send it in just to potentially receive a replacement with the same potential issues.","Been using it about a month. Battery life is good, display is crisp and bright, seems sturdy. A bump to 8Gb RAM (from the 4Gb installed) makes a noticeable difference. I use it mainly for email, web browsing and spreadsheets. I've never been a fan of a touchpad (Lenovo or any other), but a $10 mouse takes care of that. I guess my only complaint is the power cord: 1) could be a foot or so longer, 2) there is a block on the plug itself (see pic) which can make it difficult to plug in on a crowded or hard to reach outlet.","I bought this laptop for my 85-year old mother to replace her six year old Windows 7 HP laptop.  It was easy to set up and did not come with nearly as much \"bloatware\" as an HP laptop.  It has a fast CPU and is more than adequate for her needs, which are mostly just email and web browsing.  She'd be a perfect candidate for a Chromebook except that she doesn't use any Google products currently, and it would be too hard to get her to change, so Windows it is.  My only ding on this system is that the colors seem very washed out, not saturated.  I suspect this is due to the matte, non-reflective screen.  That's a nice feature in that you don't get distracted by reflections, but it does make the colors insipid.  I don't think she minds, but I prefer a more vivid display for my own use.  No data on battery use as she always uses it on her desk, plugged in.","Unfortunately we find ourselves rather let down with this purchase. The battery life isn't too bad but I feel for a new laptop should be just a little bit better. We have had this laptop about 6 months now and are already experiencing software issues. The laptop has moments where it slows down for now reason will say we are having connection issues when it is clearly connected . We've used it through both WiFi and ethernet. Admittedly Ethernet is obviously stronger than wifi but still experience some issue with the processing of page requests. Basically it works but doesn't provide much confidence that the laptop was made for longevity. I do appreciate how lightweight it is compared to a lot of other laptops I've had. It is not touch screen. We use it for school (college and a 1st grade math program - all in browser-) and maybe a resume or a random YouTube video here and there.","I haven't owned a laptop for years, but needed something portable to run automotive diagnostics equipment. This was equipped for my need with Bluetooth, DVD, USB, and SD slot. Drive is small, but fits my need, and external drives are cheap. Only negative for me is touchpad is difficult to use, especially left and right clicking. So I bought a wireless mouse for $10. Changing from 10S to full 10 is simple. It seems Lenovo now has a similar unit with larger drive for $60 more. I think that's a good deal if you need the storage. I would recommend this unit.","Windows10 S?  Really?  only programs that you purchase at the MICROSOFT WINDOWS STORE will work on this computer.  Even the Norton anti-Virus program I bought with the computer would not install until I upgraded to Windows10 (another $99.00) Home or Pro.  This is an evil marketing technique by Microsoft disguised as \"protection\".  Had I been aware of this \"feature\" I would have purchased a more expensive computer from the get-go...","Return initiated.... Came with a defective wifi adapter... Tried with windows and three diff linux distros... Nine of them could recognize the wifi adapter....","This computer is an absolute joke. You can\u2019t even surf the internet without it taking forever. Your grandparents would think this thing is slow. How is this laptop even allowed to be sold? You can\u2019t do anything, even the most mondane internet surfing causes this computer to crash. Pathetic. Disgrace. Do not buy","Received several E-Mails from \"Lenovo.com\" the E-mail talks about total support of my new laptop. I attempted to E-mail to given address. Received \"MAIL DEMON\" every attempt. I checked the label of my new laptop. Manufacturer date 04\/19\/12 Received several E-mails from Lenovo. Returned for refund","This is a good, efficient computer for home\/school use.  MIght lack a little power as a professional tool, but the SSD drive makes start-up and searches faster than I'm used to.  The keyboard is a little error-sensitive, but I've been dealing with a wrist injury since I got the computer, and that may affect things for me.  I recommend this model for anyone who doesn't need \"Power Computing\" .","For the price, this is an amazing laptop. Set up was a breeze and it was up and running in 15 mins. It does come with Microsoft explorer which can be slow so I downloaded Chrome. switching to chrome  was a little time consuming but easy to do. You have to go into settings to allow downloads not familiar with Microsoft. Easy to do. Since my first few laptop disasters with HP, Sony and apple. I stick with Lenovo. They\u2019re inexpensive, reliable and easy to use. My kids have managed to drop, spill, and download viruses on a few of my Lenovo\u2019s lol and they still pull through. Upgraded for the newer model of my last laptop. I feel confident that this one will last for some time.","I\u2019m very pleased with this laptop. I purchased this laptop for my sister-in-law who will be starting college soon. She needed something affordable, but as high quality as possible. So far, she loves it! Fast prime shipping, great screen quality, the touch screen is okay, and it certainly gets the job done. Sleek design!","what pisses me off is i cannot link this unit to my e-mail account without buying the office group so you get  outlook which i did not want . seems everything has to be bought thru M?soft. not compatible for me. i use linux at work, and love it. probablyreturn this if no solution","I use this as my travel DJ computer. It runs Virtual DJ like a champ and the solid state hardrive makes sure theres no lag between opening and previewing new songs. Its light weight and has all the connector ports i need as well as a promising battery life.","Nice laptop for the price and I do like Lenovo (I have an all-in-one desk top of theirs from years ago still going strong). It is a bit slow, I'm using it for one purpose only and it takes its sweet time printing labels. Audio is great.","I returned this laptop one day after I purchased it. The DVD tray was very flimsy and rattled when playing a DVD. The display was dim and the sound from the speakers was very soft even at full volume. Yes, I was buying a laptop at the low end of the Lenovo product line but, come on, you can do better than this.","Worst customer service EVER! The computer will not reset to factory settings. I spent thirty minutes on the phone with JEN. I told her at the start of the call that the reset instructions do not work. It runs through and stops. I told her we have tried several times. She asked me to go through the exact same instructions and we had the same result. I then asked her where I can send it back to get it fixed since we JUST purchased it to months ago and its still under warranty. She said we will need to call the software center next and see if they can help us. I told her I simply wanted to send it back and get this reset. She stared laughing and talking down to me as if I was bothering her. We purchase laptops all the time for our radio stations and all the other companies like DELL and HP have been great. Our first experience with Lenovo and its awful!","This product does not have the English keyboard - missing \u00a3 sign. Different position for @ It also doesn't have a UK charger it appears to be (as suggested by the Local IT specialist in Albox) Canadian ?  I have had to go and buy an adaptor. Due to it not having been shipped (I'm assuming ) from UK it ended up stuck in customs who wouldn't release without the completion of a form signed and returned  so instead of a delivery date of 28th of June it was received by me on 9th July 2019 after being left at some random persons flat. I have yet to use this product but not a good start.","As soon as I received the machine, I fully charged the battery overnight.  When I went to use the laptop, the battery died within an hour.  I thought it was a fluke and so I recharged it for several hours, and attempted to use it again.  Battery died within an hour again.  Additionally, the webpages were slow to load, etc.  I contacted this seller and asked if they could make it right by sending me a new battery.  Remember, the machine was brand new, not refurbished.  The seller said that I could contact Lenovo myself and get my own battery.  Seriously!  I was very upset.  So, needless to say, machine is going back to the seller.  Get your laptop from another seller, this one does not treat their customers with any respect.","I'm using it right now, for what I have designated it for, writing, internet, and stuff like this...it's awesome! The quality surpassed my expectations and it\u2019s overall durability and design are great.  Description, photograph, website presentation, and what arrived are the same-size, shape, and color matched expectations.  I'd recommend it!","I needed another laptop for a year of grad school and didn't want to spend a lot.  This works, and is much faster than my previous and pricier 2014 laptop.  The battery life isn't very long.  To compound this, it has a unique power plug that I have been unable to find in a cord that has a USB connector on the other end. If I found a power cord with a USB connector then I could connect it to my power bank and there would be no issue. Even so, this has only been an issue a few times as most times there are ample power outlets around.","This is not for power users, but I needed a computer to watch videos and work with documents on and this works well.  I use an external hard drive for storage because of the small capacity of the computer's hard drive, which I understood when I purchased it. One hint, to lenghten the battery life, It does not charge until the battery goes down to about 93%.","Typical ruination of a computer by Microsoft's low rent disfunctional JUNK operating system. Updates and bloated junkware ruins functiionality of the simple laptop!!!!!","After only 4 months the laptop went dead. I live in Mexico and Lenovo didn\u2019t honor the warranty because I bought the product in USA and the report has to be paid by me.","Look, it's an affordable laptop so I should expect speed bumps. Short battery life, touchpad that feels cheap, power adapter that stopped working after only a few months. A phone call to Amazon customer service did result in a quickly shipped replacement for the dead adapter. The boot times are pretty good however. Decent budget laptop.","Impresivly slow, benchmarks comparable to a $400 7 year old asus with a celeron processor.  Spend the extra 50 bucks and get something with an i3.","La computadora inicia Rapido. Pero se queda congelado el mouse muchas veces. Tengo otra computadora antigua a la cual se le realizo la actualizacion de windows 8.1 a 10 con el mismo problema, por lo cual asumo que alli esta el origen. O simplemente el Windows nuevo es fallido y Habra que esperar una actualizacion de correccion o los requerimientos del sistema son superiores a lo que ellos indican...","I am currently using this laptop to write this review. It has lasted me a good 3 or 4 months so far. I think it's good for student use, if not a little bit heavy for a backpack. I did want to point out though that the battery life is sub-par and doesn't last a full school day i.e 6 or 7 hours. The last thing I want to let anyone know is that the plastic on the sides of the computer started falling apart and make me nervous about how long this product will last. I didn't do enough research. If you want this laptop make sure you get the one made out of metal and not the plastic one.  TLDR. Battery life is bad, materials are cheap, overall good for school though.","Its a bit slow and can get overloaded quick if you are not careful.  But to have an SSD for this price is great.  I'll be upgrading the ram for about 30 bucks and that should solve the slowdown issues.  Also getting into regular Windows 10 is easy.  Those complaining about that must be technologically challenged.  Its a great machine for the price.","Not worth the money. This laptop feels like a toy - plastic parts and flimsy construction. Windows 10 is a nightmare to navigate and will not let you update to Chrome or other browsers. The laptop feels cheaply made and the software is difficult to use. Recommend spending more on a higher quality laptop or go for a chromebook instead.","Extremely slow, loading simple webpage seems to overload the CPU and whole machine starts lagging. It's frustrating using it even as secondary PC. I would recommend saving another $250 bucks and buy something with Intel core5 and 8GB ram to get something that is enjoyable to work with.","I bought this computer for my 9 yr old. just to get her introduced  in using a computer, with that being said i dident want to spend a whole lot of money doing so .i bought this cheap laptop that has specs just fast enought to watch movies and run a google chrome with out any problems would recommend for a child but not good for a teen or college student","When I bought this computer I was under the assumption that it was a touch screen, which was a must for what I need. I searched touch green lap tops and this one came up!  It is NOT a touch screen, therefor I am out of the $255 I paid for it!","I'm very happy with this for the money it was exactly what I wanted. I had to change the resolution so I could see it better but over very happy.. It came with Windows 10 ..plus a tutorial set up.","This unit is listed as having Windows 10, but did not specify that it has Windows 10 \"S\" mode on it.  What the f#$% is \"s\" mode you ask?  A version of Windows that does not run anything (or let you install anything) that did not come from the Microsoft Store.  So for those of us who want to move even the previous version of MS Office 2013 H&B - you cannot.  Waste of time and money!  Would give it 0 stars, but you have to select something.","This new laptop is very fast, works well on wifi, very light to carry around.

I like how light the laptop is. I also like how it charges very quickly. I also like the very futuristic design and how well the laptop works. The laptop has a great mount of memory and runs very quickly. The thing that I do not like about this laptop is the fact that the charge does not last long.","Delivery was perfect!

We didn't know anything about that name but glad we bought the lap top.","Quiero saber si a esta computadora  tengo que instalar word o ya tiene?","No lo puede usar lo devolv\u00ed as\u00ed que no puedo hablar sobre el producto","Will not recommend this to anyone. Doesn't work after 6 days pass warranty","I bought for my son for his boarding school, it was a requirement that he have a laptop.","I needed something for school and this had features that I like. Don\u2019t come with Microsoft office and when you download the app. It keeps trying to get you to purchase it.","love it  arrived quickly and in great start up and go condition","Bought this for my son to have as a windows PC option.  Great value and easy setup.","Auto up dates for four years really nice. It keeps up with the latest app.","I love my Laptop, its great, but when I received it, it was hot. A hot Laptop is no go for me. It also isn't touch screen either. Im upset though because my battery life is supposed to be 2.5 to 3 hours and its already gone and drained in one. I'm not sure if I can replace it or now though. Great laptop, but if you're looking for something with a long battery life, dont get this one.","No product key for windows 10 Pro \"Free\" upgrade. Costs $99. Would appreciate some help from the seller here, as they advertise a \"free\" upgrade on the box of the lenovo.","Construction seems fine but the mouse and keyboard aren\u2019t very responsive the mouse gets stuck frequently with makes it very frustrating to use.","received product yesterday, turned in on and set up, zfter using the laptop for about an hour i shut it off. this morning i turned it on and when it asked for my password the letter part of  the keyboard didnt work, the numbers work just fine. i have tried lenovo customer service but i am not sure they even exist. i gave it one star because it did work for an hour."],"20":["I wanted to wait a while before reviewing this product as I feel it\u2019s not proper to review within a day of having it. I bought this after my laptop died and I wanted something I\u2019d get quickly and also something cheaper than a laptop. Obviously a chromebook is NOT meant to be a laptop replacement. This does not support gaming like steam or anything hardcore. It doesn\u2019t support the usual apps you\u2019re used to such as iTunes BUT there are ways to get around it if you search up in the chrome store. I\u2019m an online editor and this is still powerful enough to handle that. The touch screen works just fine I love it and the chromebook is very sturdy when flipping the screen I have no worries about it snapping or anything. It\u2019s a good chromebook for the price, you obviously make some sacrifices of what it can handle to a laptop. Microsoft office still works just fine. It can handle the basics and things like Netflix Hulu etc you can have more than one tab open and it not be slow. I think it was a good swap for me compared to purchasing a pricey laptop. Chrome books aren\u2019t for everyone but I do enjoy this one.","Awesome considering it's chrome, that aside scrolling is very smooth, great pixels in the display. I'm recommending it so much we are purchasing a 2nd unit for my gf. She decided after messing with mine to trade in her laptop (That came a a surprised to me). Oh and I've actually found a Stylist for this chromebook after contacting Lenovo, The Lenovo Active Pen was recommended to me. I hope this helps anyone reading this review and looking for a stylist to go along with new Lenovo.","This is my first Chromebook and I love it! Pretty neat you can flip the keyboard behind and turn it into a tablet! Boot up and shut down is super fast. Most apps will work from the Google Playstore.(which comes installed). Updates to the Chromebook itself is done through Chrome Browser.  They're 3 update channels you can choose. Official, Beta and Dev. :-D  I currently have my Chromebook set on Dev update channel and no issues what so ever. Why not try the latest features?! You cant go wrong with this Chromebook. Purchase and enjoy.","I've only had this a few days. I have a ten-year-old Macbook Pro which is getting heavy and clunky, so thought I'd try an inexpensive Chromebook next, as I'm fairly integrated into Google already. Compared to the Macbook, the touchpad is sticky and friction-y, and will take some getting used to. The lid seems a bit rickety, but possibly that's because it bends all the way back to become a tablet. The keyboard is nice to type on; no issues there. The touch screen seems fairly responsive. It was very easy to set up. My biggest issue thus far is that the Amazon description says 11.6\" screen, which is measured diagonally like a TV, which would be okay, but measured vertically, there is only about 5\" of actual screen, as the \"tray\" takes up a half inch or so (it's really only about 5x10 visible, usable space.) I knew it would be smaller than my 13\" Mac, but rather disappointed with how much screen is wasted. Still, it's a pretty cheap way to see if I like this OS.","Perfect computer\/tablet combo if you are looking to transition from constantly watching things such as netflix, twitch, youtube, etc. from your phone, and want to free up concentration power. Super easy if you have a google account (android) and offers all the necessities of a computer. It can sort of \"game.\" Can play stardew valley alright and some simple ones. Use this as a work\/reference machine, and it's everything you'd want for the price.","It is my wifes and she loves it.  Had a older one, but it could not run all of the android apps like this one.  That makes this so much more usable.","My boyfriend\u2019s daughter has one, bought this for my daughter\u2019s birthday, she loves it.  Touch screen make playing games much easier for her and being able to fold the laptop as a tablet is such a huge plus.  Good connectivity hasn\u2019t seen it run too slow or lagging at all.  A good chromebook for sure!","All in all this is a good Chromebook for the price it does almost everything I wanted to besides link up with my Vizio 4K TV it's not supported I guess.?? LG Samsung and all the other main brands are supported with this Chromebook but it won't link with my Vizio TV","The original owner had set up this chromebook as administrator with his\/her own password.  Unfortunately they did not provide that password so the second owner got a useless piece of beautiful hardware.  After spending too many frustrating days trying to make the thing work, we discovered the problem and sent it back.  Will not reward Amazon by  purchasing a replacement.  Liked the keyboard and screen!","I would have easily given the Chrome OS a five stars, but the large SD card only fits half way into the machine. That means you have to travel with it separately or risk damaging it, or your Chrome OS slot when it gets bumped or anything. So you have to stick it in every time you want to upload or download anything to it. Would have been GREAT if they had a microSD slot that can go all the way into the machine so it is out of the way.","I had read that Chromebooks have come a long way, but they still have a bit to go. In my opinion this could not replace a normal Windows or Mac OS cheap PC. I ended up returning the computer because in almost every situation, it was faster and more efficient to use my Pixel 2. The apps had lag, there was even input lag from the keyboard. No thank you.","This laptop is perfect! It\u2019s lightweight everything is preinstalled. It\u2019s perfect for any college or high student. I love It!","Really neat chromebook. My first time owning a chromebook, everything functions well and is good quality. The screen can bend and fold into a tablet position. Only thing that gets annoying for me is that the touch screen isn't very sensitive, some pressure to touches has to be applied for it to work how you want. Everything else functions beautifully and it can handle multiple tabs","I\u2019m on the fence. When it works, it\u2019s awesome. But by the second day I had it, it kept freezing up on me, requiring frequent rebooting. I\u2019m asking for a replacement first and will update my review at that time. ** UDPATE ** My issues were a fluke. I've now had this device for about a month now and it's been everything I need for my \"traveling tech teacher\" position. I would definitely purchase it again!","I love this laptop because I travel frequently and needed a lightweight laptop for these purposes. This chromebook is perfect, since I generally only use google for anything anyways! (gmail, google docs etc). I highly recommend! new edit: One of my main purposes of why I bought it along to go with traveling was for my use of the teaching platform VIPKID. Vipkid no longer supports use on Chromebooks or Chrome so if you plan on using one of these for that do not buy one. It only works on Mac, PC, or iPad. I hope this changes in the future. I still love this Chromebook just wanted to add a side note in case anyone was going to buy it for that purpose.","I like this little guy. Very lightweight. Love the white case. Keyboard is comfortable. Screen has excellent quality. I don't use the touch screen much; it's not my priority.  The only thing I don't like is that the advertisement of this product suggests the battery life is up to 10 hours. It's one of the reasons I purchased this particular chromebook. Unfortunately, when mine is fully charged, it only has 7.5 hours of battery life. Still pretty good, but not as advertised. Hence the 4 stars. Easily would have been a 5 star rating if the battery life lived up to the  produce description.","Junk! First one some of the keys stopped working less than a week. 2nd one it won't connect to the wifi.","I want to replace an 8yr old macbook pro and tried this out since I'm super happy with my pixelbook from work. This laptop seemed like a good solution, but it couldn't relliabily connect to my wifi from a far corner of my house where my macbook and pixelbook have no problem so I'm returning it.","I love it!  Super quick, everything works well.  Picture quality is good, but not great, so I deducted one star.  This thing is perfect for me, couldn't ask for better.  Internet surfing, research, and a few games.  I went with Lenovo because they make my Motorola phone that I absolutely love, and I am not disappointed at all with my decision.","Purchased this Chromebook for my daughter for use in 5th grade.  The reviews on the product were good and it arrived as expected.  She began using it in August when school started and we were initially very pleased with the purchase.  Only 6 weeks into school and her keyboard isn't working.  Entire rows of letters quit working.  She's adapted and started using the touchscreen keyboard (thank goodness for it) but sometimes it doesn't work either.  We've restarted, had friends try and diagnose.  I've already placed an order for another Chromebook as she uses it daily for school work.  It's a shame that only a few weeks of use and we are stuck with a defective product.  :(","Love it! Perfect!","I was disgusted with my Windows PCs (still am) that often take 4-5 minutes to start up, so I ordered this Chromebook. It starts up in a few seconds and you can be at work right away. It automatically transferred my Chrome browser tabs and my Android apps. Then I clicked on the link to set up Linux and now I have 25-30 Linux apps that I can run, including LibreOffice that is compatible with Microsoft Office. Most people could do all their daily work with a Chromebook, but I use a few specialized website development Windows apps that don't run natively in Chrome OS or Linux. If I can't find analogous apps in Linux, I plan to install Vine and see how many of my Windows apps will run.","This was a Christmas gift for my 13 year-old granddaughter and it is just what she wanted.  She loves it!","Horrible purchase.  3 days after i could no longer return the product, the wifi went off and it will not allow me to turn it back on.  Even talked to customer support on Amazon.  They got it working for about 10 minutes then it shut off again and will not go back on.  Not even when i did the same thing customer support told me to do.  Although, before i lost wifi it worked good.  But not worth the price to only be able to use it for 5 weeks.  This is the first and last time i buy this brand.  I would return it if i could.  I feel like they stole my money.","Pro: I was sick of lugging my laptop from the office every day. This is the perfect device to keep at home for light tasks like email and internet access. The price is right. Good value. Relatively lightweight. Con: It's not the fastest device. There is a slight lag time on activities, but it's manageable. I've found more detailed work, like laying out emails in Constant Contact, to be challenging because of the track pad. I tried using a separate mouse but it's still not a great experience. I don't use this as my main computer and couldn't really see it as a replacement for that.","Turned the new computer on and it said \"System repairing itself\" There is also a broken area on the case.","I had an acer chrome book prior and was expecting the real estate to be about the same. However, I'm very unhappy with how tiny the screen view is. I have with the big black border AND the google chrome tool bar on the bottom taking up a huge space of real estate. Fortunately, I am only using this for writing my novel I will deal with it and NOT return. However, if you are getting this for internet browsing, netflix or anything else forget it.","Not sure why this happened.  The screen went black with one sliver of light in the middle.  Since there was no way to fix this problem, I had no other choice but to return the item.  Amazon sent another one out in 2 days since it was within the first 30 day of purchase.  I hope this was just a one time problem.","I am in love with this chromebook! Best one yet. It starts up super fast. The battery lasts a very long time whether i am watching my shows, typing up papers, or just browsing the web. The notebook capability is also amazing. I love to use it with the outlook notes to take notes in class. It is very easy and comfortable. I've had it for  2 months now and use it everyday for work, school and personal use. Normally, other laptops or chromebooks I've had in the past have given me issues around this time, but not this one.","This Chromebook is fabulous. It is extremely fast. I put pw in and its loaded up. I absolutely love this and I use it for college,I would recommend this chrome book to anyone. Its fast,touchscreen folds backwards. I am so happy with it.  Tyler 18 and half yrs old I bought this for my grandson for College.He is very happy with it as you can tell. We did buy another one first but it was no where worth the money. We sent it back after 2 days and had ordered this one. As you can see it is great.","Best laptop ever purchased, cannot download games of course it works as a tablet and there are games you would find on your phone in the game play store that can be installed uninstalled in a matter of seconds. Keyboard works amazing looks nice a brand new love the white color and I usually don\u2019t buy white but this is super nice and modern looking. The touch screen is just the right amount of sensitive and I love it.","This laptop is super light weight. It\u2019s makes it very easy to close the laptop and open to resume what you were previously doing very quickly. The battery lasts very long. I love how everything is connected through google docs. It makes note taking and school work extremely easy and convenient. I bought the laptop\/tablet duo for the tablet with intentions of using the kindle app with my etextbooks and it by far exceeds my expectations. Having it all there with me in a lightweight computer\/tablet combo is super convenient would definitely recommend!","This is a piece of junk. We bought it a few months ago because our chrombook from 2016 was on it's last leg. That one was under $200 and lasted for 3 years. This one worked great for a month or two but now runs SOOOOOO slow. At first I thought it was the internet but I tried it at home where I could compare it to my desktop and phone. It is definitely this computer. The purpose is to be able to use it for internet tasks. It drags when I just have 1 tab open. A complete waste of money.","Received my Lenovo chromebook today. As I do realize being that I have only had it for a few hours, I just say that I love it so far. It\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve been looking for. The setup was super easy and I know it will be perfect for my online classes! Great buy for the price!!","Had this 3 months and keyboard is broken. Waste of money","This Chromebook seems like a wonderful product.  Have had it for 2 days and can tell you this: Nice quality, sturdy and feels solid. Easy to use (never had a Chromebook before and am still learning the details) Quick response. Still trying to figure out to add apps, but I understand it's easy It's a KEEPER","Funny thing is that I never had any intention of buying a Chromebook but now that I'm going back to college, this thing has been the most useful tool that I have. I love its functionality. It's lightweight and shifts to and from tablet mode with ease. I kind of wish I could game on it like a regular laptop but quite honestly, the apps and games on the play store are more than enough. It has a long battery life and has Bluetooth capabilities. For its value, this thing is definitely worth the purchase. I never leave for school without it.","This was bought and donated to our school.  The first one stopped working after a few weeks. We got it replaced. The replacement stopped working too but it was too late to return it so this is a horrible computer. We are now stick with a broken computer that even our IT dept. Can't fix.","I was pleasantly surprised by this chromebook. It is fast and loads up quick the touch screen works great and it is user friendly. Overall I am happy with this purchase. I really like how quickly it responds. The only drawback is that since its not windows there are some things you cant do with the Operating System but if you are looking for a laptop that can stream videos and surf the net then this is the laptop for you.","I needed a new Chromebook and a new tablet but I didn't want to have to buy both. This is the perfect solution for both. It does feel a little weird when I use it for games because it is SO big but the wonderful display and color clarity makes the bigger than normal worth it. Also, bought one for my daughter for college so she could use it going from class to class and taking notes.","I added an add blocker that I was surprised I needed,but I still get offers to add or subtract services from my Chromebook the second I turn it on,it's annoying.I do like how I can use it as a tablet or add the key board.I. already use it for shopping,looking for general facts political or otherwise.I am going to check out using it to compose literal works.","If you're just looking at doing some light Android OS games and light browsing then it doesn't get much better than this for price. I use it for school and it does just fine with all the essays and emails.","Love this Chromebook! I use Google for most things including work email so this works great to throw in my bag and take to the office, to meetings or to a coffee shop. Very lightweight and super long battery life. Love my MacBook but for the price and ease of use, this is a great buy.","Great value and feature-rich. A much better computer than my other one (Samsung-3) albeit,  the Lenovo cost 100 more. The only negative worth noting is the SD card when inserted, is not flush with the body.","Bought this to replace my Samsung Galaxy tablet.  Like having the keyboard.  It came nicely packed, brand new, and in record time.  Would highly recommend this seller.  Very happy with my purchase !!","Not much I don't not like about this laptop seeing as I'm a Google gal. This is my first Chromebook and touch screen device outside of my phone. The last laptop I purchased was in 2012 so needless to say I was in need. And I'm not disappointed at all! It's better than I imagined and the syncing process was almost effortless. I'm glad I didn't pay extra for professional set up. But I did purchase the 4yr protection plan just in case. Highly recommend!","Got this for 10 yr old daughter so that she can start coding. Great price.","Doesn\u2019t work. Fully charged, turns on for about 2 seconds, then shuts off","Numerous keys on the keyboard stop working less than a month after purchase.  The unit was not damaged in anyway buy spills on rough handling.","Excelente y recomendado","Chromebook worked fine until a few days ago.  Now it will not open anything.. screen stays black.  Shutting down doesn't help.  It is totally useless now and only 3 months old. Very disappointed and there are no options for returning or replacing.","This Lenovo Chromebook is a great buy. It has great features, was an upgrade from my previous version and the screen is very clear.","This is a wonderful laptop for what it is, an inexpensive, fast, easy to use Chromebook. I have had it now for a week and am very happy with it. Can recommend it!","I'm a college student who needed a device to surf the web, upload assignments, and complete my work online. The only downside to this chromebook is the display, which isn't too detailed or sharp. The backlight is great though and the keyboard is incredibly smooth. For $250 this is definitely the best budget chromebook on the market.","I'm enjoying the Chromebook so far and it fits my needs well. Next Chromebook purchase will be a double-sided camera though. Other than that I like it!","Daughter absolutely loves this chromebook. Works perfectly for what she needs for college classes and entertainment in her down time.","I\u2019m getting used to this Chromebook and I\u2019m loving the portability and lightweight feel, very easy to transport. Very flexible and cute!!!!","This product is great but just not what i wanted.  It freeze a lot when I watch youtube and when i flip the screen from laptop to tablet. It felt like it was very easy to break so for my kids it wouldn't work. Like i said for others it maybe great just not for me.","Great speed, light, not for big jobs, but can handle the small stuff.","It is perfect size and weight. The design is great and cute. The only problem: does not allow to install Pdf and Microsoft pack - We have to use all those online. Tried several times to install, download and we have to adapt ourselves with a new type of configuration style. It is my computer for reading paper and typing classes on google doc.","My roommate is thrilled with it","Absolutely wonderful product. Easy to use touchscreen is great, screen is nice size I have the 11 inch combination of tablet and computer, best of both worlds","Love love love it","This is PERFECT for me and my schoolwork.","Bought this for my daughter to use for school and learnng, however it seems to be used mostly for games and TV shows. Who knew?! However I like the interface and quality of this pC and would buy again.","Good easy pc and can use it for anything. The only problem is that there\u2019s is no cd rom to put disks in. But it is fast with good WiFi and it is nice for school. And research.","This is a Christmas gift for my daughter so im not sure about anything yet. Will update once its been used a while to see how every thing works.","I got it for my girlfriend for her school work and she loves it.","Only had this for two days. Came in good. Condition. Seems to be a fast little computer. I bought it to take the place of my tablet that is 7 yrs old now.","Worth the buy. Great product for a great price! Use these for work and these have been great for the older crowd that relies heavily on touch screen computers. Makes my job much easier and saved me a lot of time in dealing with my customers.","Used it a few times and then the screen went out","Bought this to replace my wife's Asus 10.6, that finally came off its hinges. She is thrilled with the Lenovo. A bit larger but very fast and reliable.","Works great! Shop, banking and bill pay pretty much what I use it for.","This is exactly what I wanted laptop\/tv\/tablet. Perfect for travel and nice and light to carry. I use it around the house for everything.","This product will not even support light browsing or email. Extremely upset. Every time a tab rigisters a page the whole thing crashes. Can not process.","Works great. My son loves it. Great bye. Good software. Easy to use","blutooth doesnt work, touch screen hand everytime, i need to restart laptop frequently. display light is very low, it looks like dark.","I love the Chromebook! I opened the box, plugged it in, signed into my Google drive, and began using it straight away.","does a tremendous amount. This, a phone, and a workstation can pretty much take care of your needs.","This system comes ready to use out of the box.  No issues with setup or use.  Works fast, its lightweight but doesn't feel cheap.","Love the laptop! It's easy to use and very light weight (:","So far so good. Excellent product at a great price. Touchscreen works well and no lagging on apps thus far. Would definitely recommend.","This is exactly what I needed for work. I needed something to have all my work emails and ...stuff.

I really don't know if this is a good choice for a chrome book but I do not like the price being raised in one day and then being rolled out as a 2019 model even though spec wise they are identical.

Best chromebook."],"21":["This unit is \"pretty\" and stylish, so my high school daughter was attracted to it for that reason.  I would have purchased a rugged military grade ASUS C202SA-YS02 but it was not as pretty as this Acer, so,  in order to please her I bought this Acer.  Being a girl, I figured she would be gentle with it and she was.  However, with in the first few months the Wi-Fi stopped working and it was repaired under warranty which got her through the rest of the school year; when I spoke to the repair technician they confessed this unit has a history of Wi-Fi receiver problems.  Then it rested some over the summer (in other words, not much use).  It has been about 2 months into the school year and the Wi-Fi has stopped working again, only a few days after the warranty expired.  Acer wants $170 to just look at it then add the repair cost on top of that.  The unit cost $275 to start with, so it is not worth repairing.  Buyer-beware! UPDATE: I repaired it myself for $12. I  had nothing to lose since it was a paper weight otherwise.  Upon taking off the bottom cover I spotted the wireless communications chip (pictured) and googled the model number to find resellers. compupartsolutions.com had the best price but yours maybe different. The shame of it is knowing it took me 15 minutes and $12 to fix it and Acer wanted to rob me of $170 just to look at it.","I've been EXTREMELY impressed by this device. I was initially a little nervous as the system was somewhat glitchy for the first couple of weeks, seemed to be a problem with the Chrome OS because it was fixed by the next update. I previously had an Acer Chromebook c720 which I LOVED--had it for 3 1\/2 years and traveled with it all over the world before the keyboard finally died.  Here are my favorite things about the R11: -Touchscreen: hey, it's not an iPad, but it works great for what I need it to do (reading and annotating e-books and pdfs through Amazon Kindle and a great app called Xodo). If you're an artist, probably not responsive enough, but if you just want to play games and underline the occasional text, this is awesome. -360 degree rotation: LOVE the ability to watch movies in tent mode, turn it into a (slightly heavy, thick) tablet. Switching back and forth is seamless once you get used to it. I was super worried that touching the keyboard when it was in tablet mode would cause it to switch back to laptop mode, but it looks like once you move the screen back past like 180 degrees, it goes into full touchscreen.  Took a week or so to get used to, but love it now. Screen stays in whatever position you put it solidly enough to use the touchscreen. Processor: I currently have 4 windows with a total of 18 tabs open. I streamed an HD movie on Netflix with all those open, no pauses or buffering. Unreal. Battery: SOLID. Seems to have a slightly shorter life than my Acer c720 (which literally went for days), but probably because of the aforementioned dozens of tabs and Netflix. The promised 8-9 hours definitely holds true, and will last longer if brightness is turned down\/you're only web browsing, etc. Price. I mean, come on $300 is unbeatable if what you want is email, Netflix, and books. I feel like I have a tablet and super mobile laptop rolled into one. The bad: - speakers are a little tinny (though the volume is AWESOME) and it's not possible to customize the equalizer on the Chrome OS right now :( - though it's a super light laptop, the chromebook is a little heavy as a tablet, not super practical for holding, but if it's resting on something, it's golden.  I mean, if you want a true tablet, buy a true tablet--this did honestly keep me from investing in a kindle as I was planning to. Overall: I'm super happy with this product. So far, I feel like my expectations have been not only met, but exceeded. If you purchase this product, go into it with realistic expectations and patience getting familiar with the setup and you'll probably love it, too! :)","I bought this Chromebook on the prime day deal, but even without $60 off it would still have been worth the money. I love that it is only as big as it needs to be to have a full-size keyboard (not with a number pad, but full-sized keys). It looks way better in person than in the pictures. White exterior, black keys, very sleek and modern. Since you have access to Android apps on the Google Play Store, you don't have to rely solely on the Chrome browser to access apps. I searched for top android apps for chromebooks on the web, and found which apps work better than Chrome pages. I haven't had issues with the track pad as others have. It feels responsive to me, and I went to settings to customize the speed, clicking, and scrolling. I also bought a wireless mouse, which paired perfectly. Update it as soon as you turn it on! You can Google how to update it. I have a feeling that many of the negative reviews are by people who didn't update their Chromebook right out of the box. Do your research, learn how to optimize your experience, and you'll love it!","I rarely write reviews. I mostly do video reviews, but never of specific products. That may change here soon. This this is awesome and has quickly replaced many of my gizmos and gadgets, some that have cost me upwards of thousands of dollars. People who complain that Chromebooks are useless without internet access clearly are narrow minded and simply not thinking outside the box. Allow me to explain:  Let me begin by saying I take tech seriously. Since beginning a journey into a lifelong passion of filmmaking and screenplay writing I have invested tens of thousands of dollars of my own money into PC's that can keep up with the demands of 4k video editing and post processessing. I have amassed a couple of decent PC's, one a custom desktop (still being built; $3K~) and another an ASUS 970m ROG Laptop ($1300~)  that are great for exactly what I need them for. My desktop runs all my video editing software for my bigger and most demanding projects and my laptop is great for editing video and running PC games in places other than my home (like school!). Recently, I've really gotten into writing more and I've found myself coming up with ideas on the go and wanted something a bit lighter than a 10lb ASUS Laptop (that thing is a monster). So mind you I really ONLY purchased to type down ideas as I had them, Seriously. I wanted something I could work on my writing projects on the go, so I paid the $250 for this thing. I just wanted a mobile typewriter. But oh my... I had no idea how far the rabbit hole went, When I recieved the item I was amazed at the quality of it. I've had my fairshare of \"eBay Special\" aka Cheap Chinese iPad knockoffs (seriously, I've owned atleast 8 I think over the past 8 years) and have found each one to be a complete waste of money. Either they were so slow I couldn't get any work done or they just flat out broke after a couple months. I even broke bad and bought an $350 iPad and returned it not too long afterwards (I grew to dislike Apple products as they don't play nicely - or cheap - with just about anything else I own.) I was weary about paying this much for another iPad wanna-be tablet, which has an OS that doesnt go with anything, from a company that specializes in WalMart consumer PCs. But just at first glance, this thing is top quality. Nothing on it feels cheap at all. Not the glass, the display, the aluminum cover, the plastic. All of it feels very strudy (within reason) and has a nice, modern look and feel to it. I feel like this will look good in any decade. Very futuristic. I boot it up and notice quickly the display seems to be 720p (or something close) but for what I need this thing to do... who cares? I just want to type words on it. The touchscreen and the hotkeys along the top take some getting used to but I was quickly in the Google Play Store, downloading all the apps I have on my phone and linking them to my accounts. \"This thing is neat.\" I thought to myself as I was scrolling through Facebook, listening to Pandora and playing my cloud save of Falloiut Shelters. I became a wizard, learning to use the touchscreen, keyboard, and touchpad all in tandem. I prop the thing up to watch a Youtube video. \"This thing is really neat.\" But oh yah! I was supposed to use this to write! So I went to install my favorite screenwriting app, Trelby, only to find its not available. Darn. I use some other apps but nothing is quite the same for my workflow. So I got desperate and booted up Linux on it. After some headaches and code learning, I quickly abandoned the stupid idea when it became more trouble than it was worth and factory reset. I thought the gizmo was neat but I was disappointed that I couldn't really use it the way I wanted to it that regards. This is where the R11 gets interesting. I quickly realized that I could use the Google Remote Desktop app to access my desktop computer. BAM! I was writing on my scripts at home! I was using my whole $3k desktop on this little $250 laptop and it ran flawlessly! I could even watch videos and game from the laptop itself (to an extent). THIS IS AMAZING! But... If i wanted to use it on the go... I would NEED that internet connection to access the files. Man... maybe those negative reviews are right. Maybe this thing does suck without an internet connection.... Except everyone in 2017 is carrying a little WiFi router in their pockets. It's called a cell phone and even my cheap $30 ALCATEL has a tethering option. And just like that, I realized that I can use my studio desktop wherever I want, whenever I want. That is just incredible. For $250 I can control my $3000 PC anywhere. She's got a USB for a tactical mouse and external keyboard, an SD slot and an external HDMI output. This thing is the ultimate mobile workhorse. Sure, it wont completely replace my ROG Laptop is terms of what it can do on its own but the ability alone to access my own desktop and use it as a touchscreen laptop is just amazing. This is the ultimate tablet. This thing is amazing. As a matter of fact, I wrote this whole review on it. Buy it for school, buy it for home, buy on for the grandkids. Cant go wrong on this one.","I have to say, I was somewhat hesitant purchasing this chromebook mainly because of some of the reviews.  Due to the excellent return policy on Prime I decided to purchase this.  Yes, I threw the dice!  1st, I was shocked at how easy it was to set up.  Maybe 2-5 minutes to log into to my gmail account and bang!  Had access to my files stored in the cloud.  In preparation for becoming a chromebook user I had purchased a 256 gig memory card and moved all my laptop files to it.  It worked great.  I now have my files backed up to the card and the cloud. Every app I have downloaded from the google app store has worked perfectly.  Of course, I am not a gamer but I don't see why they wouldn't work also.  Amazon, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, Facebook, Skype, as well as the google suite of docs, sheets, slides, and photos work great. There nwere complaints regarding the lousy screen resolution, as well as the mouse pad not working well.  I guess I got one of the good ones as I have had no trouble at all. Honestly, my 1st computer was a Atari 800 which I hacd to learn Basic programming to get it to do anything.  Since then I have owned HP's, Dells, Compaqs, IBM's, essentially every major computer maker desktops and laptops.  This by far has been the easiest to set up and use.  That's from a guy who has been fighting the technology for 40 years. OK, here's a wake up call to people complaning about the Chrome OS.  Quite simply, this is not a Windows machine.  Period.  It does not look like windows nor does it act like windows.  It reminds me a great deal of my Samsung Note.  It is fast and simple.  That said, there are windows software that you cannot even attempt to use on this machine.  For instance, MS Project, MS Visio,  software like that.  You can however download from the playstore MS Office suite.  I did not and will not do this.  I am trying to break from Mr. Gates and this machine allows me to do this.  Did I mention, I can access all my word, excel, and powerpoint files using the google apps.  Also, when need be I can save the docs as pdf's like I had to do for updatiung my website.  Oh, by the way, Weebly website builder works great on this chromebook. I also read reviews that the sounds wasn't good on this machine.  I downloaded Pandora and listened to all my stations at 3\/4 volume and it sounded fine.  The speakers are not like my JBL 4311 studio monitors at home but they sound good enough to watch Netflix. Of course, I have only had this Acer for a week.  I am really putting it to the test.  If something happens within 30 days I will return it but I will get another one. One irritating item that was a easy fix, The chromebook really wants to save to the cloud and not to the card I installed on the computer.  If you go into setting and click the advanced tab you can decide where you want to save your files.  You also have the choice of it asking you everytime where to save the document. Good luck in your hunt!","I was deciding between this and the Asus Flip C100.  I chose this one mainly because of the full size keyboard, larger screen, and full size HDMI.  Most specs were similar between the two as far as performance\/battery life\/touch screen.  I bought a new device (1 year Acer limited warranty).  Here are some of the things I wanted to know during my research: 1. Touchpad.  A LOT of negative complaints about the touchpad.  It does make quite a loud click when you depress the button.  I use tap-to-click, so it's not an issue for me.  You CAN right-click by using two fingers to tap the track pad at the same time (or 2 fingers on the touchpad, using one of them to press press down\/click the touchpad).  The feel of the touchpad is not as smooth (frictionless) as others I have used, but it's not terrible either.  I have not had any finger detection issues. 2. You cannot open it with one hand like a Mac.  However, it does feel like a sturdy hinge.  The screen does not wobble as there is a good amount of friction holding it where you put it.  When closed, the two slabs of the computer are noticeably discrete, but flush against each other (they don't form a smooth ovoid shape when closed like other laptops). 3. Reserve your judgement until you've updated the software entirely.  Performance will be poor unless you click \"Restart to update\" on the lower right corner of the screen (symbol is a small arrow pointing up).  This may happen multiple times for ChromeOS, Adobe, or other programs.  After this, performance will pick up to what you would expect.  I have not had any freezing or screen flashing issues. 4.  It's a chromebook.  Giving lower stars for not realizing its limited capabilities is your own fault.  I love the feel of a lighter OS and can do many tasks using Google\/Web based apps. Overall:  I like it and am happy for paying a bit over $200 for the 4gb model (at the time of writing this, it sells for $220 new).  I can live with the so-so touchpad since the rest of it feels solid\/sturdy.  I bought a new device so I wonder how many technical issues (freezing, finger detection issues) came from people who bought used devices.  One plus I'm particularly happy about: a quiet fan-less device that doesn't heat up too much!  I will update if there are any issues I run into.","Well, I have to say, I\u2019m fairly impressed with my new Chrome Flipbook! My trusty Windows 7 laptop was on its last leg and I opted to try something new. It\u2019s a tablet and a laptop and now most of the Android apps work on Chrome. So now you can find just about any functionality that you\u2019re used to in Windows. The only drawback is that it only comes with 32 GB of hard drive. However, it comes with 100 GB of free Google Drive online storage. And you can plug in an SD card or external drive to if you need to. Configuring the printer was a little tricky but not bad. And the Blue Mail email app handles my multiple emails from multiple domains. It\u2019s cheaper than most laptops. AND THE BATTERY LIFE! I\u2019ve used it for 3 days and still haven\u2019t plugged it in!","I spent most of my life using Windows, and the last 4 years using MacOS. I wasn't really sold on the idea of Chromebooks (\"Why would I buy a computer that's just a browser?\") but after trying one I may never go back. Handling everything online erases all the headaches that usually come with owning a computer. It's fast, secure, easy to use (even as a tech geek, it's nice knowing something's just going to work). I'm a writer, and this has easily become my main computer for both work and play (Google Docs easily replaces Word, and Android apps make it much better for gaming than I originally expected). The touchscreen looks good and is responsive, and the keyboard is nice. The battery life is great (I get about 9 hours). My only complaint is the click on the touchpad feels a little cheap, but I just use \"tap to click\" so it's not an issue. Overall I love this machine, and all my computers will probably be Chromebooks in the future.","Yes, this Chromebook comes with the Android app store pre-installed. Although 4 gigs of RAM doesn't seem like a lot to some of us, because of the simple software, it is very fast with no lag. My wife upgraded from the 2 gigs of RAM version to this, and it seems like there is more than twice the performance. The screen is pleasantly satisfying with the touch screen and foldability. The power button is no longer on the keyboard, but is instead on the side of the machine which is fine. My wife uses it for her work where she uses programs for scheduling clients along with editing and posting pictures. This machine, through her minimum time of using it, has already been so much faster for her to use. Spending the same amount for a PC would be a very SLOW PC, but this Chromebook is definitely not slow. I'm amazed at this product that has the same build as the other Acer Chromebooks. We are happy to be selling her old one we bought just a few months ago, in replacement of this new R11!","I am VERY happy with my Chromebook! I have had it about 4 days and have been checking out how well it runs my favorite Android Apps. So far all but 1 of the Android Apps that I have tried have functioned properly, but some are restricted in the size of window that will work properly. The 1 App that is giving me a problem pertains to the sign-in process, the App gave me a choice to sign in with a Facebook account, Google account, or Email account. I chose to sign-in using my Google account which did not work properly, it seems that the Chrome OS was not able to supply the correct account information to the Android App. So my advice is to use an email account if possible to sign-in any Android Apps that you originally set up that way. Now about the Chromebook, I am very impressed with the speed and physical design. I have always been a \"mouse\" guy and actually have a wireless mouse operating on this Chromebook, but I find myself using the touchpad more and more. I have read about people having trouble \"right clicking\", scrolling and a few other problems (as I did), my advice is to use the \"Help\" function to see the correct methods to use the touchpad. I suspect that the Android glitches mentioned above will be corrected with future Chrome OS updates, but even until that happens I am still thrilled with my Chromebook! ***Update*** The 1 Android App mentioned above has resolved their problem with the Chrome OS, so now all of my favorite Android Apps operate satisfactorily on my Chromebook! I am still very happy with my purchase!","So I went back and forth about buying this device and truth be told. There are a lot of negative comments on this convertible style Chromebook.Well, everything is prone to wear and tear, I bought the 2-year warranty because I know electronics. Highlights: Touch: The touchscreen is very sensitive and responsive. Great job Google. No one wants a touchscreen that is outdated like most aftermarket car stereo touchscreens [cringe] Speed: This Chromebook boots in seconds. I haven't seen a system boot faster yet. It chews through 1080P Youtube videos like nobody's business. There is hardly any delay when flipping it to tent-mode, to tablet-mode, back to computer-mode while playing the video. Speakers\/Sound: Meh. That's all I can say. Get a nice pair of Bluetooth headphones because who wants to be tied down to the screen. They do get loud and if you want an extra boost, look up EARS for Chrome. Android Apps: This is very cool, being that we still have the original ACER Chromebook which is about 5 years old, looks great, runs as good as it did when we bought it, but it doesn't have Play Store access. This R11 DOES. That's awesome in itself. Everything works and I couldn't be happier. Invest the extra for the 2-year warranty and enjoy your Chromebook","UPDATE:  Ok, it's been 2 months and I still LOVE this little 2 in 1.  I haven't opened my overpowered laptop since the day this arrived.  It's completely functional and gives me ZERO issues.  I have become a Chromebook convert for everyday use.  I use this for my schoolwork, a LOT of Netflix\/Hulu\/Amazon Prime\/Xfinity streaming and have started using it to take notes in staff meetings at work because it's so light to carry around.  Still charges fast and I can charge it about every other day and be fine.  If it's a little low from a binge watching evening I can plug it in while I shower and dress and it has plenty of juice to last me all day at work.  I didnt particularly care for the straight white color so I purchased a Decalrus Decal Skin and it's gorgeous.  I took a picture of the decal and set it as my wallpaper so it all matches.  I get TONS of compliments on it at the library,coffee shops, and at work. It's been less than a week but so far so good.  I don't mind the keyboard size, I have pretty tiny girl hands so it's quite comfortable for me.  I can see how someone with larger hands would have issues.  The picture is sharp and crisp.  It's great to stream movies on.  I haven't any issues of it being slow, but i haven't try to fill it with apps, just the essentials for daily life since i carry it around with me everywhere.  So far I'm LOVING the battery life.  Before this I was using a kindle and I felt like I was always charging it because it was fast to drain and slow to charge, it was one of the many reasons I wanted to replace it with something more functional.  This Acer charges to full power FAST and I yesterday I didnt even need to charge it.  I ran it completely down last night and where I plugged it in less than 2 hours ago and it's already @ 83%.  I love that! I see many people giving bad reviews to products because they don't care for the Chrome OS.  I don't think that's particularly fair.  I will touch on Chrome OS since so many people do that.  It IS different, and it does take some getting used to and if you are expecting a Windows PC you are going to be disappointed.  It's pared down, you don't so much have files but apps.  It's not meant to store a bunch of junk but access the web and store things on the cloud. So far 5  stars.  If something malfunctions I'll update but as of now this little bugger is exactly what i needed for online college courses, netflixing, and social media.","As a former laptop repairman, I was a little leary of the flip-over screen.  But design advances seem to be in play here.  This one feels really solid.  The screen is Gorilla Glass and is readable at much grater angles than the C720.  the touch sensitivity is top noch. I use this mostly, right now, for gaming and reading.  With the keyboard flipped over, it makes a slightly bulky tablet that displays a full page in color beautifully.  finally the perfect tool to read some of my larger volumes and magazines.  I can even rotate to view single page full screen. And yes, connect to wifi and run the first update.  After that, you'll have nearly full access to the android store.  I think it registers as a tablet, so the games that limit or restrict tablet use (like Pokemon Go) will also restrict this device.  But the influx of options from the google play store add some very powerful tools to the slowly growing, but still thin chromeos options. Oh, and the nicest change from the c720 is the SD reader.  Now, instead of thecard sticking out all the time, it click-inserts fully and flush.  So, now you can leave the card in all the time and still zip into a tight neoprene case.  Also, the AUX jack has been moved to the other side to help reduce the accidental power cord plug in failures. I've never been this excited about a laptop before.  And I used to build and repair them. One year update:. With a little care, I've managed to keep this in good condition. just discovered today however that this model is part of the Linux beta program. I installed Linux with very little difficulty, and then a couple of applications. tried to install Minecraft but had some problems could be me. I'll go for some standard apps like Gimp,  LibreOffice and civ Free. Linux runs in a pocket like any emulator, but any folder you put at the top level appears in the downloads folder under a special Linux section. you can pop files in and out of the Linux experience as simply as dropping them into the downloads. I'm also been doing some collaboration via Google Hangouts. The built-in mic and video cam make that a beautiful transition I've had no problems with it at all.","There are certain very basic tasks that this computer can do... but unfortunately, there are lots of things that it can't do. A lot of app software is really only good for mobile devices but they use the same app store because they're idiots. A lot of websites don't work properly with the Chromebook, even though you're using the SAME browser. It's just that Chrome doesn't work the same with a Chromebook as it does with Windows. Why? Who knows! Also, my computer has been having lots of problems with associating files to the right apps... and unfortunately, there's some glitch in my system that prevents me from being able to manually associate files with the right apps... and the chromebook support told me that it's a hardware issue somehow that's only associated with my chromebook. Seems unlikely but whatever, I'll go with it. Overall, this thing can do very basic stuff, sometimes. But even basic stuff around my business it can't do so I can't even just travel with it because it doesn't work on my site when I need to make basic editing changing. Oh well, lesson learned. Hopefully in 10 years they'll have this figured out and it won't suck so badly. Until then, I'm going back to a regular laptop with Windows on it. It's a great idea, lightweight, easy to use, simple... unfortunately, it's reality isn't nearly as good as the idea it was built upon.","This is my 4th Chromebook and this is an absolute dream! It has a very nice solid feel to it, the screen is gorgeous, the battery lasts all day and then some, the keyboard and mouse are incredibly accurate, comfortable and a pleasure to use.  I honestly don't know where else you would find a better value in a Chromebook with this many features.  I can have over a dozen tabs open at the same time and this laptop is just as fast with one as with 12.  Last week the Google Play store became available and that just added icing on the cake to an already phenomenal laptop!  I can now sync all my apps from my cell phone with my laptop and enjoy seamless integration...nothing seems to slow this powerhouse down. The weight of this is perfect for traveling; less than 3 pounds and easily slips into a backpack or carry-on.  I have a 22\" HP monitor plugged into mine via the HDMI port along with an external Logitech keyboard and mouse.  When we travel we always take this with us as it handles everything we throw at it with ease!  We can use it as a laptop or tablet, this one device eliminates the need to carry multiple tech items with us whenever we travel locally or internationally.","I am so happy with this new Chromebook that I bought a 15.6 non convertible one for my wife. I just couldnt see spending in the thousands for a Apple when this was an option. My computer sessions on a laptop or tablet are always web based so this seemed like a no brainer. My only reason to need more computer is for complex photography editing, but I have a dedicated desktop for that. This Chromebook does simple photo editing great. The battery life is great unless you watch videos and Im guessing that you could still watch two or three streamed movies on it without charging. try that with a conventional laptop! I charge it up at night and it runs all day. I bought this to replace my first generation iPad mini due to the fact that its software is no longer supported, so far it does everything I was doing on the iPad but now I have a real keyboard. My first conventional laptop was an Acer and it still runs fine but it cant be updated past Windows XP so I thought I would get an Acer this time, then I bought my wife the 15.6 Acer Chromebook, so our household now has THREE Acers that still run! This is my first ecperience with Chrome OS but I doubt I will ever go back to Windows.","My expectations for this computer were completely blown away. I thought I was compromising speed and ease of use for a cheap price, but I actually prefer this computer to Mac or Windows. Everything is so easy to use and very fast. All of the apps that I regularly use are at my fingertips and a surprisingly large amount of apps are available on the Play store. Everything between my Android phone and laptop syncs effortlessly. (I can even unlock my laptop using the fingerprint reader on my phone.) The screen is great. The sound is decent. The mousepad and touch screen are not precision instruments, but I have yet to misclick because of them. The RAM is sufficient. The battery is awesome. Honestly, I don't have a single complaint so far. Now, given, I'm not doing any heavy computing. I'm just remote-desktoping into my work computer via Citrix, streaming music, browsing the internet, email, document editing, and productivity tools. In addition, the hard drive is only about 24 GB of usable space. For photo editing and gaming, I will still have to pull out my old 12-pound Macbook Pro. But for everything else, I have this Chromebook which cost 1\/4 the price.","Purchased 12-4-17 and died on 7-8-19 From the instant I got this Chromebook I liked it way more than I thought I would. I used it for just about everything when I was home, and it was great for travel too. I watched movies on it at the airport in France when my flight was delayed. But I tired to turn it on yesterday and nothing would work. No lights came on, the screen was black and the power button did nothing. I tried to charge it and still no lights came on. I tried several different plugs around the house and in spite of the battery area getting warm on the bottom nothing happened. Let me know if there is something I can do to fix this. My google results only come up with stuff that voids the warranty.","Cons: 1. You can't add the Word app to edit docs on this thing and Google Docs change formatting and isn't as user friendly or detailed. If I had known this I probably would have spent a little more on a different operating system. The only workaround is editing online but that requires internet access and many word features aren't available. 2. There are websites that download files in rtf format and you have to play around finding programs that read that type of document. 3. I use this for school and I have a school site to access PowerPoint presentations. The site auto downloads and opens the presentation when you bring it up. I can't figure out how to stop making chrome stop autoloading pages when I open it. If there are multiple links to presentations I can only access the first one because that's the one that loads first. 4. I can't figure out how to 'right click' without a physical mouse. Pros: 1. it's super fast to boot up and is instantly ready to go. 2. I love the touch screen! 3. It's super light 4. The battery life is excellent 5. It's made very sturdy and feels like a thicker tablet. Overall it's a great deal if only I can figure out how to get through the annoyances mentioned above. Fortunately I am pretty good at figuring things out and I am sure eventually these kinks will work themselves out.","I am very old computer geek and have owned a great many laptops since the 1980s.  I bought this for my wife, and liked it so much I bought one for myself.  The Acer R11  is my favorite computer of all time.  Its rugged, trouble-free, and totally reliable.  Never freezes up, never makes me wait more than a few seconds for updates,  runs all day on a battery charge, and doesn't take long to recharge. It has a nice, bright display, excellent touchpad and keyboard, and works well in the tablet mode. Even though it has only a Celeron processor, it's remarkably speedy on the net and can run several Chrome tabs without bogging down. I can't imagine why anyone would need a Chromebook with a faster processor.  Unless you are doing something really unusual, like running movies in several different windows, you wouldn't notice much difference in performance.  In a side-by-side comparison, my son's $2K i7 computer and my R11  appeared  so evenly matched when rendering a complex web page it was hard to tell which computer won, I still keep a windows laptop around for running specialized windows apps, such as PCB design software and controlling milling and 3d printing machines, but otherwise I can go months without ever touching the windows machine.  And that suits me fine  After experiencing the Chrome OS I have no further desire to deal with Windows unless I absolutely have to.  Windows is so annoying,  I have talked three other friends and family members into switching to R11's and they are all very happy they did.  The R11 runs most Android apps I have tried, but since Chromebook apps pretty much handle everything I need to do, I don't use the R11 to run android apps.","Wanted to update to a Chromebook that could access Google Play Store apps.  This works fine for that.  A little bigger than my previous one, (also an Acer) and a much sharper screen image.  Very happy with this purchase.  Now I can check NFL and NBA updates with the google apps - love that. October 12, 2017 -- Started having trouble maintaining connection to wifi (Spectrum service), but usually after several loops re-entering password, connection would be re-established.  Sometimes had to do several times, but thought it might be an idiosyncrady of this model.  As of tonight I cannot connect AT ALL.  Says signal is \"out of range\" and I'm sitting 6 ft from cable box.  Soooo, I don't think that's the problem.  I should have returned it as soon as connection started getting spotty, but since I could usually re-connect during browsing session, I ignored. Now I'm really bummed that I have a very nice looking Chromebook with a beautiful screen that is totally unusable.  Would not purchase again - at least not this model.  BYTW, all my other devices and mobile phones work perfectly.","I've had my 2-in-1 for a few weeks now and I love it! I use it for college and daily browsing\/apps. I prefer Microsoft Word for writing papers but this gets the job done just the same. You can connect a wireless printer but it's a bit of a hassle. I have to make sure my desktop computer is on & awake in order to print wirelessly from the Chromebook. Overall, I'm really happy with this purchase. It's a great buy for the price.","This is a wonderful device. The touch screen is very easy to use and my son has been very happy with it. The keyboard is nice and responsive and the screen is clear and bright. The battery life is actually longer than I expected. Unfortunately, the wifi keeps dying on an irregular basis. It will work for a day or two and then die for a week. That makes a Chromebook less useful than it would otherwise be as a laptop, but more useful as a doorstop. We can use it at home with a wifi to USB dongle, but it is useless out of the home. Too bad, because the workmanship seems to be quite good from the outside.","hello, so my chromebook worked great for the first few months I had it, but it had a wifi card failure which you can find in other reviews. I'm a student, so I'm unable to be without my computer for weeks, so shipping it off for repair just isn't an option. Fortunately I know a lot about computers and can repair them. Great, so all I need is a wifi card to replace the failed one. Well customer service would not send me one even though according to their warranty agreement, they are allowed to send replacement parts to the consumer(yes it is up to Acer's descresion according to the agreement). It's just bad business practice to only offer a repair if the user can be without their computer for weeks and pay for shipping. In fact, I don't think they're honoring the warranty if they do not make accomodations to the user. A product should not ever fail within the first 3 months if it has a 1 year warranty. I ended up buying a wireless card because I could have my computer back up in running in 3 days rather than 2 weeks. This way I would not miss anymore homework assignments. But now my wireless card failed again after about a month. So here I have had to spend an additional $50 in ownership for 5 months of use. It's a bad purchase taking into account no warranty support. I recommend looking at a different brand. The chromebooks are pretty cool, but they are not windows machines, so I would not pay more than 350 for one ever just because they are so limited. If it dual boots into windows then I would pay more.","First one that they shipped was obviously defective, super slow and speakers were garbled. The replacement I got was much better, but still too slow for my expectations. Going from acer 15 to acer 11 was difficult, 11 inches seems too small for me. Also it's not a true SSD drive in there but emmc, which makes a difference. I wound up returning it. Next time i'm going to do my research better and check the octane levels and pick a chromebook with stronger performance.","The computer has difficulty switching between tablet and computer. The screen continually flickers when trying to switch apps. The video is me trying to open Netflix. I just got this thing today & was really excited about it but this has been frustrating & disappointing. Maybe it's a fixable bug? I haven't ran into much issues at all with other Google products but this doesn't seem to be following that trend. UPDATE: 2\/28\/18 A couple days ago I updated the Chrome OS. The update was designed to make it easier for the device to use Android Apps. I had to restart the computer but since it turned back on it hasn't showed the same glitches between tablet mode & laptop mode. I'll wait awhile until this device gets 4-5 stars. For now I'm okay with upping the experience & device to 3 out of 5 stars. I'll leave the video as reference in case other users find it relatable. Updated 6\/20\/19 Several OS updates later and I'm pretty satisfied with this purchase. Only knock at this point is that it took several updates for this computer to become the purchase I was seeking more than a year ago. Good price and great functionality, though.","Reason for purchasing: I was looking for a small device with good battery life that could let me do the majority of my work when im away from the office but still around Wifi. The chromebook seemed to allow me to get at least most of that done. Feedback: The device does everything I need it to and actually allows me to do far more than expected. It isn't as solely focused on google docs and drive as many expect. With just a few extensions I am still able to utilize OneDrive and Office online rather easily. The inclusion of the Android store is neat and I have found a few great apps that I am utilizing from their including my hearthstone fix every once and a while. The biggest boon I have found however is the ability for moonlight game streaming. If you have an nvidia graphics card you can download this great extension and stream your steam games over to your chromebook and play away with great results. This device has alllowed me to get a majority of my work done, and has been great as a play device as well. **The first one I got had pretty bad back light bleeding, I just returned it and got a replacement from Amazon. The second one has some bleed along the left side but isn't terrible at all. Despite this I am incredibly happy with the rest of the build quality. It is plastic but it doesn't feel like terrible thin plastic. I actually rather enjoy its feel.","=== Updating my review: I've had this Chromebook for 10 months, and I hate it more every day.  In addition to the weird keyboard (see below), starting this week it will not stay connected the internet.  My HP laptop doesn't have this problem, and both the laptop and the Chromebook are connected to the same wireless internet service. Searching the internet finds various suggestions, e.g. \"powerwashing,\" but some users say this doesn't work, so I hesitate to try it - I hate solutions that say, \"try this,\" try that,\" etc... I just want the darned thing to work. Also, various apps do not work correctly,  for example, Google Calendar shows part of the day, but the scroll bar does not appear, so I can only see certain hours of the day.  Every time I use this Chromebook, I wish I hadn't bought it. === Original review below === I've been using computers and keyboards for 40+ years - and this device has the WORST keyboard in recent memory.  The product description claims this device \"...maximizes productivity with fully functional keyboard...\"  While it's the same size  and shape as my laptop keypad, for some reason I cannot reliably position my fingers on the correct keys.  I often find I've typed an entire sentence (or more) with my fingers on the wrong keys, which is very unproductive when trying to take real-time notes in a meeting!  Or any time, really!  I eventually realized that my HP laptops have a small raised \"bar\" on F and J keys - it's very subtle, but it lets me know - without looking - that my index fingers are correctly placed on the keyboard before I start typing.  The keypad is my main complaint about this device, but it also seems rather \"clunky\" and ugly compared with similar devices, and the white color just makes it worse.  If you're gonna buy a clunky ersatz computer, get a darker-color - it won't be as noticeable.  I wish I had shopped for this product in a store where I could physically try it and compare with similar products - I'm quite sure I would have decided to spend a bit more money to buy one of the better-designed competitors.","I am a tech\/gadget junkie...I'll put that right out there.  I like Windows....but not on a small touchscreen\/convertible.  I really like this Chromebook.  It boots fast, is responsive (the touchscreen is just a tiny bit wonky closing tabs at times), and is powerful enough for browsing, streaming, and productivity tasks. Will it replace a full laptop?  Heck no. I use it as my bed\/travel web machine (I like to have a small touchscreen for reading\/browsing in bed).  It has good battery life, a nice bright and clear screen, and it's light. It is what it is, and it performs great for what it does. Highly recommended!","I am a Chromebook fan. This is my third personal Chromebook purchase and I work at an elementary school that purchases many different models, brands and styles of Chromebooks. This version has been my least favorite version I've had for the following reasons listed bellow the pros. Overall, its not horrible, but I wouldn't purchase this model again. Pros: -Great price for a touchscreen Chromebook -Long battery life -Charges quickly -Holds a charge for days if stored in a bag (For taking and using at college) -Has all the great Google features you would expect from a Chromebook Cons: -Biggest disappointment is the track pad. It is glitchy, and barely usable. -Screen feels smaller than other of the same size. (Not sure why, its just an aesthetics feeling i have) -Poor sound quality compared to other Chromebooks i've used.","Choice this masterpiece under $300 IPS Touch Screen possible Tablet mode N3150 CPU performance is better than N3010 4G Memory 32G SSD !!! (not eMMC) Pure White Color Support Google Play Store Completely if i were you, just select this R11 model, not others.","I will hold out on the fifth star once I have this over a longer period of time.  First, I would like to say if you are not familiar with Chromebooks this will be a change, depending what drive system you are coming from.  I have used chromebooks for the past two years and have come to love them, despite my many hesitations. This computer is just what I was looking for in size and function.  I travel a lot and needed something small to work on as well as watch movies on.  I do all of my work in google docs and save it as Microsoft Word dox when needed.  Many of the reviews I read stated the touch screen had some issues for them.  I did not find that to be the case on my chromebook.  My touch screen functions just as well as my other electronics. Overall, I would purchase this again, great for what I needed.","Based on my experience, this product is outstanding. OUTSTANDING. I don't just mean for the price, though that is a HUGE wow factor. It exceeded my expectations in every aspect as a computing machine. I use this product every single day for a large amount of the day and I have been impressed with how reliable it is and how intelligently it was designed. This is USER friendly, without a doubt. Personally, that is great because the nature of what I do for a living exposes me to \"computer illiterate\" clients and colleagues and this is a great device for them to learn on without getting frustrated. Learning to use a new piece of technology can be discouraging to some and cause them to abandon the endeavor entirely, right? If you are hesitant about using a product that is referred to as \"User Friendly\", my boyfriend is a data scientist and uses a similar Chromebook for all of his computing needs. He found it easy to customize and shared this aspect with his computer programming brother, who now owns several Chromebooks and is a fan for life. Those points are true of Chromebooks in general, but this Acer model really goes above and beyond with the intuitive and efficient conversion back and forth between the following set-ups: laptop, display, tent, and pad. I have seen product reviews that, though overall positive, claim that there is something to be desired either for the track-pad or the touch screen feature. I am not ruling these areas of criticism out of my future relationship with this machine, but I have not encountered those issues yet. If you are wavering between this and a similar Apple product, especially if the price of Apple devices is a concern, this is a much better way to go.","This device is a good value. I had reservations about the convertible package, but it is well done.  The hinges are cleverly made to give good friction and geometry throughout the range except the last little bit in either direction.  Then the lid sort of snaps into place as it is closed or fully folded back.  The unit is off-white or beige- colored.  There is a nice texture to the finish.  The unit is light enough to carry between thumb and fingers.  There are no fans.  Warming is minimal.  Battery life is somewhere well beyond 7 hours and charging is quick. The touchscreen is sensitive and smooth.  The keyboard is comfortable and has a decent feel.  Despite some of the criticisms by others, I find the touchpad to be smooth and responsive.  One thing I learned quickly is that the pressure on the touchpad has to be very light.  For example, if your finger pressure is too high, the cursor sort of sticks.  The two-finger stroke for scrolling up and down when viewing document or a webpage works very well in lieu of a mouse thumbwheel.  Just lightly brush the touchpad with the 2nd and 3rd fingers.  Most of the chromebook multi-touch gestures seem to work.  I haven't had consistent luck with the two-fingered tap for right-click, but \"alt + single-tap\" does the same job.  \"Tap to click\" is sensitive, which can cause problems if you tend to drag palms on the touchpad while typing. I connected a bluetooth mouse, which I prefer to a touchpad for moving the cursor.  Logitech M557 (large mouse) and Verbatim 98590 (small mouse) work fine, without evidence of the sleep problems experienced with Windows.  The chromebook mouse interface doesn't seem to support adjusting thumbwheel sensitivity, which is one reason the two-fingered touchpad gesture for scrolling is valuable.  The only mouse adjustment is pointer speed.  The special Windows button on the M557 pops up the App Launcher.  Between the touchpad and the touchscreen you really do not need a mouse with this system. The display is just \"okay.\"  I operate it at full brightness.  It is a little bit sensitive as to vertical viewing angle.  The resolution is adequate for most purposes.  In the tablet mode, in portrait orientation, I could comfortably read a full magazine page of the Economist, for example.  This involves very small print rendered as an image rather than as font.  The lower resolution causes a gentle blurring of the print in this situation, when compared to the crisp display on my Nexus 9.  (Zooming the magazine display in laptop mode seems to be a better alternative.) Speaker volume is excellent.  Half volume is about right for watching a Netflix movie.  Dialog clarity is fine. Many of the android apps I care about work fine, and this will probably improve with time.  This fact makes the chromebook a nearly complete replacement for a laptop.  Nook**, Kindle, 3M's Cloud Reader and Overdrive android reader apps work fine, and the device makes an excellent ereader, offline or on.  The Microsoft Outlook android app works fairly well, with some quirkiness.  About every 3rd time I send something it encounters an error and, fortunately, saves the message as a draft.  Excel, Word and OneNote android apps aren't compatible with this device.  The online equivalent apps work fine, although starting up the OneNote application seems slightly clumsy. My unit came loaded with File Commander by Mobi Systems.  I installed android OfficeSuite Pro, made by the same people, in order to provide an off-line office system other than Google's.  OfficeSuite Pro integrates with File Commander and can access GDrive and OneDrive and can open password-protected files.  File Commander offers a scheme for transferring files to a PC via wifi.  ( ESS File Explorer offers an FTP interface I think is better.)  File Commander insists on having access to  contacts, maybe for \"sending\" files to others. I could not get HP's eprint scheme to work but was able to install HP's \"All-In-One Remote\" android app.  This software enables printing to and scanning from my HP C8610 printer while connected to my home network.  Printing is only for pdf files, but the Chrome browser, OfficeSuite Pro and other apps support printing to pdf as an intermediate step. It looks like this is going to be a 95% replacement for my laptop, especially when travelling, and I am very happy that I bought it. ** Nook's reader is touchy for me.  It breaks if one tries to read a book in two-column mode in a maximized window.  Minimized, it works fine either in two-column or one-column mode.  I haven't found that magazines are affected.","I ordered one, the touch pad failed to work consistently. Two replacements had the same problem  all in 4 weeks. Great warranty from Prime!","Bought this last year on July. Pro: light, reasonable price, fast, Cont: Keyboard key fragile. after 6 months my eyboard key is not function very well. I only use the chormebook for surving the internet, checking my email, and watch hulu or netflix. I rarely use the keyboard. this is something to reconsidered  if one to buy the chromebook for doing homework and a lot of typing. Up date Per May 13\/2018About two  months ago, the charger wont work. I try in diferent outlet around the house.  Since myine is no longer have guarantee. The chrome is OBSOLETE So latest update the charger only last about one year and the half.","This is an ideal device for me.  It's a Chromebook, so all my files are on Google's cloud, it's relatively immune to viruses, malware and ransomware, and the battery lasts all day.  It doubles as a notebook, with good keyboard, and when flipped into the 360 degree position, it is a touchscreen tablet.  I have run several Android apps, including the Kindle reader, so that is great. My only complaint is that the mousepad seems to be insensitive, as other reviewers have noted.  Moving the mouse with this pad is not always easy, and I often revert to touching the screen to achieve what I want to do. Overall, I think is great value for money.","I am honestly upset that I bought my new MacBook, because this is everything to me. I am a huge google drive user, so this is perfect. I'll be switching from the iPhone 6 to the pixel after my contract is up. Seriously, I'm in love.","Fantastic Chromebook. I tried a number of Chromebooks before settling on this one, and the #1 reason is the keyboard. This has a great keyboard that feels much better than most others. The typical Chromebook keyboard has very little travel\/feedback from the keys, and most feel very cheap with a zero-feedback key action. Don't get me wrong, this is not as good as a full-sized keyboard, but it is surprisingly easy to type on. In fact, I understand Google themselves designed this keyboard for Acer. Anyway, it feels good. The display is great, but be warned--it is highly reflective. Using it outdoors or in rooms with lots of bright overhead lights is challenging. in the 4GB\/32GB configuration with the faster processor, this is a very fast Chromebook. The screen flipping trick is a nice feature if you occasionally need to use it to watch a video, do a presentation, or as a tablet, but it is too thick (3\/4\") and heavy to use as a tablet regularly (feels like it weighs more than twice as much as my iPad Air). I am very pleased with my purchase though--I needed a small and light laptop for work use with browser-based apps. Perfect. Also, the 10+ hours of battery life is awesome. Paid $240 new from Amazon (I personally would not buy a laptop from a third-party seller).","Things are so far so good with the chromebook. However, I am not getting a 10hr battery life. I can charge it to full, use it for 20 minutes, put it to sleep and when I return the next day or so, theres like an hour remaining. Definitely have to bring the charger when I'm leaving the house. Everything else works as stated. I'm still adjusting to chromebook shortcuts and whatnot, but it's a good laptop for the house to do simple things. LOVE the touchscreen, crazy it took so long for us to have access to this feature! Skype app doesn't work which was disappointing since Microsoft owns it, I guess. Have to use it in the browser. Skype is one of the main uses for me. Company wars still affect us here.","Have to be honest here... I thought I was buying something else when I ordered this. I was shopping for something new after my beloved Toshiba chromebook was destroyed.  I had about a half dozen options in open tabs comparing featured for a few days and was being a good cautious grown-up about the whole process. Then one day at the office I got the news I was being sent on a long work trip and decided I should pull the trigger right then so it could arrive before I left.  I brought up the session on my phone and hit on what I thought I wanted - a similarly priced ASUS convertible. Imagine my surprise and initial dismay when this...the very chromebook I am now this moment typing upon...arrived at my door. I decided I didn't have time to replace it and I'm so glad I did.  It's great. Not the most powerful or the most stylish. But it is solid and a great size for me ( I'm a big ol' boy) and runs smooth as butter. It handles a ton of open tabs and runs video with zero hiccups.  The screen is bright and crisp for the resolution and the battery is way better than my old one. I really dig being able to use android apps as well.  Yeah, many of them are superfluous when you have a good browser.  But I use a few drawing and design apps regularly for my job and having them here means I didn't also have to take my tablet with me. The texture on the cover is nice and 'grippy'.  The hinge is solid and steady in all positions. The touchpad...could be better I'll admit.  Sometimes it takes two tries to do a two finger tap.  Other times the tracking is not so smooth.  It doesn't seem to like a three finger tap at all. But it's not such a problem.  Otherwise this thing is one of the best screw ups I've ever made.","I had a previous Acer chromebook from 4 years ago that I used pretty heavily, so it was time to upgrade (the only one wasn't fully functional anymore). This is quite the upgrade. The first improvement is the screen quality which was necessitated by the addition of a touch screen. It looks great and the touch screen itself is everything used expect from a tablet. The tablet functionality means access to the Google Play store. This is a huge benefit for a device like a Chromebook which can now run native apps rather than rely entirely on Chrome plugins and web browsing. The peripherals are nice. The HDR webcam vastly exceeded my expectation and the speakers on there Acer chromebooks is always great, especially given the size of the laptop. Clearly Acer know that these devices are getting used to play YouTube videos and do casual web browsing. Given that, the 4GB of RAM means it always runs smooth even with several tabs playing videos or something of the like. My biggest grip would be the trackpad. It just isn't that great, but it's not so bad that it's problematic. Some 3rd party apps also do better at resizing between laptop and tablet mode than others which can be a bit annoying. Overall, however, a very solid chromebook at a very solid price. I'd definitely recommend it if a chromebook fits your use case.","This is not the most intricate operating system in the world; however, I believed it would suffice for a 7th and 8th grader. The units are only used at home and  they are fully capable of using a computer. There were no issues with the computer until about 4 months after the purchase. The computer was charged and when attempting to cut it on, it showed a message stating that the \"Chrome OS is missing or damaged.\" Although it is still under warranty, it is rather inconvenient to send it back. I haven't even looked into shipping costs. As a busy mother who does not have time for things like this, I would encourage others to beware if considering this product. I wish I was!","Bought this for a long trip, and so far it's worked wonderfully. The size is adequate, the hinges on the screen have (so far) been sturdy, and the battery life is great. Most features I use include Google (maps for my trip, gmail, calendar, etc) and web-browsing. The fact that most programs I'd run on a PC have an app is just another bonus. Cons: The screen has a lot of glare and it uses a bulky charger. As a whole, this chromebook way surpassed my expectation for a little over $200 purchase (refurbished). Unless you absolutely need USB-C or can't stand glare, don't hesitate to buy it.","I love this thing. I'm not a gamer, programmer, graphic artist, or somebody that need serious processing power. I am someone who likes to surf the internet, watch YouTube, and take classes to finish my degree online. This thing does everything I need for it to do. I love the touch screen ability and how I can fold this thing so it's like a tablet when I read books. When I needed to buy a laptop and saw the price tags on most Mac Books and laptops, I almost cried. How the heck was I supposed to get through all my classes without one, yet I couldn't afford them. Then I discovered these Chromebooks. For about a third the price, I get all the functionality I needed. I have had this thing for a couple of years now and can confidently tell you I still love this thing. The battery lasts for a crazy long time, and its so lightweight and portable. I love that it's small and compact and fits into my tote purse. If you're like me and don't need to run crazy functions or play computer games, this is a great dependable laptop for you.","I'm going to say, great deal for the money.  I bought it for an employee so only used it a little help set it up.  One thing for sure is the track pad is not great at all and reason for -1 Star.  Lots of lag, like really bad at times.  Felt like it had to wake up or something.  I don't like the direction of two finger scroll, hope that can be changed but I didn't look.  The build quality of this machine is very nice.  After enabling Play Store and poking around a bit I could tell that everything was as snappy as the fastest smart phone.  Everything opened with ease and restarts are nearly instant, not like a smart phone.  The keyboard is better than I expected and the display is really crisp and bright.  I think it's a perfect size for a portable, convertible device.  I hope they can keep it white if they want it like that.  It looks really sharp and clean that way.  If it were mine I'd custom paint job or vinyl it from the start.  It comes as pure white of course.  I'm not sure the pictures do it justice...  It's a looker!","Before purchasing this Chromebook, I was using both a Mac and an HP laptop. Both of which were expensive laptops at one time.  Needing to purchase a more current computer on a much tighter budget, I did a lot of research and opted for the Acer Chromebook R11.  I knew before I purchased it,  that I shouldn't expect (or become angered by) a level of quality that was not as high as my former laptops.  The less-than-expensive price tag  was a HUGE first clue.  Also, remember that laptops and notebooks are from the same fruit bowl but definitely not the same fruit. Notebooks are generally smaller and don't weigh as much as a typical laptop. Those two elements of a notebook explain why a laptop is able to \"out manuver\" a notebook. More functions = more hardware = more wieght. With all of that in mind, I am very happy with my purchase. The notebook is, as previously mentioned, VERY  light-weight, modern in color and design, and by taking just a bit of time learning how this \"new(ish) breed\" of notebooks work, I can say that I would definitely buy it again.  The creators of the Chromebook know that there is a small learning curve when first discovering how to navigate their product. There is printed material included with the notebook that addresses some of the differences, as well as, websites that do the same (both the product websites and personal blogs from unbiased reviewers). At first I wasn't happy at all with the trackpad, but after reading one of the blogs I previously mentioned, I was able to fix the \"out-of-control\" feel when using the trackpad by learning that it works much like my previous Mac. Trackpad \"smoothness\" is obtained by using a specific number of fingers \"swiping\" in different directions. A shortcut that I am loving more and more everyday. There is still a bit of a \"clunky\" sound when clicking on the trackpad. However, I usually \"tap\" the trackpad rather than \"click\" it anyway. And remember...VERY affordable price tag. Personally, I LOVE the keyboard. I was expecting to have to type on a truncated keyboard with little room for my hands\/wrists. Not so. Rather than trying to  cram all the \"normal\" keys on the keyboard, the creators developed different keyboard shortcuts that give the user most of the functions he\/she is accustomed to having. There is also an online keyboard that gives the user even more options. The only thing I miss from my former keyboards, are the ten-key pad and the backlit keys. AGAIN...won't-break-the-bank price tag. The  size and quality of the screen was a nice surprise. The picture is sharp and the colors vivid. I find that since the screen is nearly edge to edge, it creates the feel of a much larger screen. The quality of the sound was also a real surprise. I didn't expect the it to be so full-bodied and powerful. As for the convertable ablilities of the notebook, I land somewhere just a little to the left of \"Highly Satisfied\"... more like \"Almost Highly Satisfied\". This is why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5.  When I play my favorite games, the sizes are wonky. In tablet form, since my games are vertically oriented and the \"tablet\" dimensions are basically tall and skinny, the games appear HUGE. This is good for those who normally need their readers to see the games but it makes me feel almost cross-eyed when playing them. I've also experienced a glitch that sometimes \"freezes\" the move I just made so I have to touch the screen again to \"unfreeze\" my move.  But this only happens every now and then so it's not a deal breaker for me. However, there are websites that address both issues but I haven't had time to see if the \"fixes\" work. All in all, I feel like I came out ahead in the game of cost vs function. There are still several functions that I have yet to use and more \"hidden\" functions that I have yet to uncover. If you are looking for a notebook that is much more affordable than the well known \"giants\" of computer land, this notebook would be a very good choice. Just remember the INEXPENSIVE PRICE TAG. If you think you ordered a really cheap \"apple\" you are going to be disappointed when you receive an \"orange\" (albeit a very juicy one). It all comes down to expectations.","The touchscreen stopped working about 8 months ago, and the keyboard stops working sometimes. And recently the battery life has been not lasting long at all.","What I like: 1) Flip-form: means I can use it to watch videos on my exercise machines.  In flip mode, it perches just fine.  I can't really do that w\/ any of my regular form factor laptops. 2) Battery life is very impressive: 12 hours. 3) It's great for doing something while parked in the car.  I've had some useful teleconferences after pre-downloading docs from my local wifi, and then having them kept open in my chrome browser.  State was kept, (in other words not reloaed upon flipping back open) which I was a bit worried about. 4) The weight.  It's very very very light.  Did I mention how light it is? 5) I like the centered keyboard.  I've always like the Mac style centered keyboard, and the PC style left shifted keyboard (for the number pad) has always been an annoyance.  The science (from area 51) is in, and shows that non-centered keyboards will actually turn you into a hunchback in 3 days time, unless you crack your back with a clockwise twist at the end of the day. 6) I't be great for taking on vacation:  None of your data would have to be on it (so you can skip TSA & customs violating your right-to-privacy: \"here ya go, you idiots\") and you can tablet for entertainment, or keyboard for worky-worky type stuffs. What I dislike: 1) The battery charger connector is the poorest fit & finish I've ever encountered.  It just rattles around in there.  In order to charge it reliably, I park it next to a vertical edge and push the connector into it's rattly little connection configuration, and then butt that up against the vertical edge.  All that said, if I do that, it charges just fine.  But still... sheesh! What I'm still getting used to: 1) Everything done from Chrome -- although I don't know exactly why this is a mental problem for me, since 95% of what I end up doing is browser based, anyway. 2) The whole google doc\/slides\/sheets look & feel. I'd also be interested in one of the larger screen models -- if I can find a good 15\" one, I might treat myself sometime. I also saw (a friend sent me some links) there are Linux installs (as virtual machines?) that go on top of the Chrome OS.  That's nice, because I've been a Linux kinda guy for the last 20 years.  Windows?  Why would you do that to yourself?  Mac?  Acceptable, but very overpriced for what you get.","It's a Chromebook, so it does what Chromebooks do.  This is the 4th Chromebook I've owned, and the best of the bunch so far.  The touchscreen makes certain things very easy, as compared to using a mouse.  The Bluetooth and wireless functions work well, and have better than average range.  I don't need a large screen, especially as a frequent traveler.  The overall size of this Chromebook makes it very easy to travel with.  The speakers are laptop speakers...don't expect surround sound.  But compared to speakers on other similarly sized laptops, these are better than average.  My biggest \"like\" is the battery lift.  At maximum brightness, I can still get 8+ hours out of it.  At a comfortable brightness level, I routinely get 10+ hours of battery life.  This is a big deal when traveling, or when using the device and not being conveniently near an outlet.","I got this on a lark to see what it can do (I own a Macbook Pro and iPad Pro).  So Far, I am pretty impressed.  Battery life is great, the keyboard is pretty good, the touchpad works well.  I have only tried the tablet part for a little while, but it seems to work well. It did not take me long to hook up to Dropbox, OneDrive, Slac, WebEx, Kindle, Pandora and Spotify.  The sound is pretty damn good for the price. I like the tent-mode: it was perfect for letting me follow a recipe on Superbowl Sunday.  I love that it is just \"on\" when I open it up. Editing a MS Word doc did not offer too much functionality, but Google docs is pretty robust. I'll update this after a little while but, after just a few days, this seems like a great deal for $270.","I bought this Chromebook back in August of 2017 for college (essay writing, research, basic internet browsing, downloads). I absolutely have enjoyed this laptop. It is easily portable, and fits perfectly in my bookbag. My Chromebook is 2 years old, and when fully charged can last me 4 full days of use. The only downside is that some computer programs I needed to download for school are not compatible with Chrome OS yet. The touch screen works great. It is super durable. I would highly recommend this laptop for general everyday use (ie. school work, internet browsing, entertainment).","While there is lot to like about this unit including the touchscreen, formfactor, lightweight design and ability to convert to a tablet, there's a significant flaw.  Even though I had NO apps installed and Chrome OS was fully up to date with the latest version, this unit would drain 20% of the battery in a 24 hour period in standby with the lid closed.  I had even disabled \"Keep Wifi on during sleep\" setting as well but the problem remained.  Back in the box and returning to Amazon.","LOVE THIS. I had a MacBook Air that my ex convinced me I \u201chad to have\u201d 4 years ago. I never fully understood how to work the thing, and nothing was intuitive (unlike the iPhone). When the thing finally crashed I was relieved - I could finally get something else. I only really browse the Internet and do my budget on my laptop. I couldn\u2019t decide between a tablet and a laptop, so this was perfect. I love that the keyboard can be a stand. I have zero complaints- does exactly what I want in a simple and inexpensive way. I will say the Apple was much sleeker on the outside - this one doesn\u2019t scream quality when you hold it, but it doesn\u2019t feel flimsy either. If it could be sleeker and lighter that would be cool - but for the price I\u2019d probably buy this one again anyways. I think it\u2019s perfect for most non-student, non-gamers. With so many","...And it's amazing! It's perfect for school and for anything you would use Google programs for. I use Google Docs and Google Drive for everything so the integration is awesome. The convertibility of the screen and the ability to use it as a tablet is just an added bonus. The speakers, although in a weird place underneath the computer, are amazing and have awesome sound quality. Perfect for Youtube videos, Netflix, or Hulu. Perfect for doing all these things quickly, because this computer is fast as lightning. I could go on and on about this little laptop and how much I love it... but overall just know that you will love it! The ONLY downside here is that you can't download programs... so no gaming if you need to download a program to play them, no Microsoft Word in the traditional sense, etc. But if you're someone who just wants a fast computer for watching videos\/shows\/movies online, browsing the internet, using Facebook, downloading apps to use it like a tablet, this will be awesome for you.","IT was set up under 5 minutes, with minimal fiddling with login\/password and basic set up thats typically required for any  new hardware. I was hesitant to buy this- I bought this a long with HP 14\" laptop, with comparable spec and ended up keeping this one, and sent the laptop back for refund( I intended to do the opposite, thinking I was going to keep the laptop). If you are on the fence about this, buy this with confidence. screen is sharp and Netflix, web surfing is seamless. I love it. I bought this for my dad, but I fully intend to buy another one for myself. I consider myself an avid Apple user0 with iphone, ipad, and imac and Mac air 13\". But after such ease of setting up this one, it forever changed my mind about chromebook. Love it.","This computer has been working great for me since I got it about 6 months ago. I woke up today and now the touchpad (computer's mouse) and touch screen doesn't work at all. I've rebooted and factory reset then rebooted again and it still won't work. So now have to carry a mouse around with the computer. I had a different Acer Chromebook a few years ago, a couple months after that purchase the entire middle row of keys wouldn't work. And now the mouse gave out on this one. I love how Chromebooks are set up but wouldn't recommend an Acer unless you want to have to buy and use other accessories to use the computer. Not buying and Acer again after these 2 terrible experiences.","Five star! It's not great at any one thing, but it's very good at a lot of things.  For me, this has replaced a laptop, a tablet, and a Kindle.  Chrome, all the Google apps, Kindle, Sling, Netflix, Youtube, etc... It does it all.  Works well: keyboard, touchscreen, touchpad, and long battery life.","I bought this Chromebook to replace an older C720P from 2013 that is finally showing signs of age, after daily, heavy use (e-mail, internet surfing, Amazon buying, game playing, etc.). I will shed a tear when it finally dies. I decided to get this Convertible model and in the few hours I have had it I am very pleased. I had thought long and hard about getting a \"real\" tablet, but my I have never been too adept at using a screen keyboard (I have a Kindle Fire and it is fine for what it does but I tend to use it more as a reader than anything else). While this Chromebook is bulkier than a fancy-schmancy I-Pad or Samsung Galaxy I like having the keyboard for e-mail and other applications. However, my principle reason for wanting this over a tablet is Chrome. I have the aforementioned CP720P, two Chrome boxes and two PCs I use with Chrome and the integration is fabulous! I hope this Acer lasts as long and works as well as the older one.","Only one issue arose, but it is the fault of Chrome OS and NOT of Acer or its harware. After the second charging of the battery I noticed that it would only charge to 96%. It would charge, just not past 96% and the charge light would never turn blue like it is supposed to when fully charged. In the settings it also never showed a completed charge. Did some research and found that this is a problem of Chrome OS and not the hardware. Powerwashed the device and depleted and recharged the device about 3 times and as of right now it was able to charge to 100% and register full under the settings. Other than that I have been very pleased with this device.","It's a chromebook, so it took some getting used to for me, but my daughters (who use these in school) had no issue.  My eldest took it when she had an extended school trip (6weeks) away and we didn't want her to lose\/damage her good school laptop.  She said it performed excellently for the word processing tasks she needed it for, and in the evening, it was even better than her regular computer for streaming videos. The flip aspect of the computer is handy and that is what we purchased it for.","ACER needs to send out a recall-and-replace for this model.  Like so many, many others, my battery is defunct: I can't charge it, no matter how many hours it's plugged in.  It's still under warranty - - but they don't provide packaging or shipping to their repair facility, they say it'll take a couple of weeks and that they'll restore it to factory specs (read: lose all my work and apps). Since there are hundreds and hundreds of us affected by this problem (Google it and see) why don't they do the decent thing, admit it's a lemon, and replace it with a model that works???","I researched MANY laptops out there and started reviewing people's comments on the Chromebook, which I hadn't considered until then. So many great reviews on the battery life and speed of the Chromebook are what sold me on it. It took a little bit to get used to as it is a web-based (runs on Google Chrome) system. Most if not all of the applications I use are downloadable from the Google Play Store and so easy to use. I also love the touch screen feature and the fact that the screen folds flat so you can also use it as a tablet. It is VERY lightweight and easy to travel with. I recommend this if you are in the market for a 'laptop' that you may use to do web searches, blogging, internet shopping or reading from the Kindle app. It's wonderful!","Should not of bought this chromebook. So inconsistent in turning on - sometimes immediately sometimes you have to wait, hit the power button repeatedly and wait some more. After about 5\/10 minutes of use the screen goes crazy and you have to force to power down and wait to restart. It gets two stars because it is a nice light weight and the folding is nice.","I purchased my Acer Chromebook R11 9 months ago...  I really like this laptop  and have been very satisfied with it - but recently I have been getting a black screen and it seems to be happening more often lately.  Is there any fix this as I have been reading up on this and I don't feel this should be happening to a laptop that is only 9 months old...  I guess I am fortunate that it does come back on as the reviews I was reading some people get black screen and cannot turn it back on... Luckly mine goes back on after a few minutes when this happens...  Not happy about this...","Great little device. Does everything it says it does. Runs Chrome, runs Chrome apps, Chrome extensions, all very well. Android apps work relatively well for the most part; some are buggy but Android support is still in beta so it's to be expected. My big issue with this device which brings it down a star is the touchscreen is... not very good. I actually sent my unit back in for a replacement because I thought it was defective, however I had the same issue with the replacement. It's not a dealbreaker, just an annoyance - sometimes when you tap the screen, it registers as a tap-and-hold. So the app thinks you're holding your finger down on the screen until you tap again to release it. It's very sporadic, not happening at all on some days, and then happening on every other tap on other days; no rhyme or reason. Again, not a dealbreaker, but something I've learned to just be patient with. Great battery life, lasts all day at work with me (screen brightness turned down a bit most times though). Tablet mode works well, but sometimes gets a little janky - for instance, on two occasions, it got stuck in 180 degree rotation after taking it off tablet mode, but it's quick\/easy enough to change, no big deal. Random sidenote: Sometimes Android apps run better than their web counterparts on this device. For instance, inbox.google.com runs quite choppy for me on here, but running the Inbox app from the Play store runs smooth as butter. Same thing for Google Music. Not a problem for me personally, but something I thought I would mention.","I LOVE this Chromebook! It's very fast and also has a touch screen. I didn't even realize how much I'd like a touchscreen but I do. The keyboard is the perfect size and so is the screen.  I like to shop and watch YouTube videos online.  I also do a lot of typing and read my emails.  This Chromebook is perfect for these applications.  The screen can also be rotated almost 360 degrees too to make this into a tablet, or you can tilt it so that it's like a tripod to watch movies or YouTube videos on it.  I also bought a keyboard cover\/skin and a screen protector from Amazon too.  Because I drop my laptops about once a month, I also bought a hard shell case for it. For about $300 total, this was money that was very well spent.  I have to say this is my favorite laptop ever (except maybe the first one I ever owned, which was cool too for the mere fact that it was portable).","Had it for about 3 days. Really for this price I'd be hard put to find a better value. Touchscreen works great, screen could have a little higher resolution but this is a budget computer and works fine for our needs, and the option to use it as a tablet is great. Haven't run into anything I can't do with it yet, even Matlab has an option to use it online so you don't actually need to install it (obviously a bit of a watered down version but it's servicable). Can even VPN into work and use remote desktop to work my work computer from home. The ability to run linux apps is also really useful, especially for things like libreoffice. Overall I really couldn't be happier with the value on this. Battery life is amazing. I've easily been getting 1.5 days out of a single charge.","Bought for the wife for Christmas.  It was worth the money.  We have iPads and a desktop.  She needed something portable to work on her home business of billing for doctors.  With this, she can take it to their office to work, stay at home to work, or wherever.  As long as there is a wifi connection.  Most of her work is done online.  We have Office 365 Online and all the billing is done online.  She hasn't had one complaint about this product.","I have had this for a few weeks now and I'm so happy that I chose this lil Acer! I use it for work and it has been great, easy to travel and take with me on the go. It comes with a SD slot that I'm using and two USB ports, headphones, camera, AND HDMI port. It charges fast and even with my wireless mouse and working for hours on end the battery has lasted at least a day and a half. I wish I hadn't had waited so long to make this purchase","If you know what you're buying, then you should be in love with this product.  I rely heavily on the Google suite of products, and have an Android phone.  I use Google drive to store nearly all of my documents, photos, etc. so buying this just made sense to me.  We were looking for an affordable computer for everyday use, and that's what this is. No frills software wise, but I have to say it really is a nice looking piece of equipment.  We use it around the house for music, to do bills, surf the web, or read.  We bring on road trips so our kid can watch movies.  You should understand that the functionality of this device is magnified greatly by it's connectivity to the internet, and your usage of other Google products.  You can connect to the Google play store, and download apps just like you would on your phone. I try to shy away from them (aside from Netflix) as the notifications are annoying to me and they seem to slow the device down.  That being said, my wife loves the apps; she uses Snapchat, Facebook, and lots of others.  They all run pretty well on a this device.  The fact that you can use it as a tablet or put it in \"tent\" mode is a bonus.  It's a great product for the price, especially if you're a Google suite user.","As we move to cloud computing, I learned Chromebooks have their place in the world of computers.  Though I've owned different Chromebooks, I found this one to be the perfect specifications for my needs.  I ALWAYS keep my Chromebook on hand no matter where I go, I  simply tether this Chromebook to my mobile phone when I need internet access. If I had any future suggestions, it would be having a backlit keyboard and a brighter screen even if I lose an hour of battery, it would be worth the trade off.  It's perfect for students, casual and light business uses...","Had it for a year now, chrome os continues to improve despite problems here and there, the things functions and multi-tasks like a champ if you have the high memory modal, great for everything internet related, android apps are a option but some may not run well. Chrome and google apps and serveries work very well. After a year of use the only problems I've had was with the charger going to crap dew to moving the cored around also chrome os bugs. If the machine last another year i will update to 5 stars. Warning you will be making sacrifices switching to Chrome Os, but this machine can get most jobs done, plus the added bonus of being on a more secure system. This is the best machine for the internet.","I'm going to be attending ASU in the fall, and am currently a full time student in community college.  I have a dedicated powerhouse desktop for anything requiring serious power.  However, I felt I was lacking a portable machine that would allow me to do work away from my primary PC.  I had an old laptop, but it was large and clunky and didn't support 5ghz channels.  I was beginning to feel the hinderances caused by the laptop, so I decided to look into buying a solution.  This Chromebook has been perfect.  Obviously, it won't be able to play the latest games and be a great photo editing machine, but that's not what it was built for.  Chrome OS is very light, so the machine is useable within 10 seconds of starting.  The battery lasts forever, as advertised.  The performance is wonderful as well.  This Chromebook is surprisingly powerful.  As of now, I have 10 Chrome tabs open while streaming Spotify with no issues.  For anything browser based, this feels identical to a high end laptop like a MacBook Pro at a fraction of the price.  As well, the thing is incredibly light.  It's half the weight of my old laptop, and I often forget it's in my backpack. I've only had one issue, and it's not the fault of the manufacturer or Chrome OS.  I've attempted to create a profile on the Chromebook with my ASU email managed by Gmail.  I haven't been able to, because ASU has some funky authorization rules and won't let the Chromebook create a profile with the email.  Of course, I can access the ASU email from the browser after logging into the Chromebook, but I'd really like to be able to actually create a user account with that email.  Other than that little quirk, my experience has been flawless.  Highly recommend this machine.","I had wanted an inexpensive laptop for online use, and I was initially pleased with this one, given its reasonable price. My impressions on the construction, keyboard feel, and display were highly favorable. The tiny, tinny speakers leave some to be desired, but with Bluetooth connectivity I can easily send the audio to a better system. After owning the device for about a month, the wifi began suddenly cutting off. I tried shutting down and restarting, which sometimes restored the wifi connection, but never permanently. I searched the web and found the solution: the wifi card and its antenna wires became dislodged. It's an easy fix that involves removing the back cover, popping out the wifi card, and reinstalling it.  You can find videos on how to do this if you search on \"Chromebook WiFi Turned off \/ disabled\" Given the number of complaints I've seen, this seems to be an inherent problem with this model. I don't know whether it was an assembly mistake that, once fixed, will not reoccur, or whether this is an ongoing maintenance issue. I'm still otherwise happy with the R11, but because I had to repair it (albeit slightly) after only a few weeks, I've given it only 3 stars. Has it not has this problem, I'd have given it 5.","This is my second Chromebook. The first one was also an Acer I bought last year. I liked the first one for general Web access around town but thought it was too big for travel so that's why I looked for one a couple of steps smaller in size. This fits the need. The display resolution is less than the other Acer which was a full HD display (1920x1080) but I can live with that. Even with the lower resolution the display is quite good. It does come with an SD slot which is great for transferring pictures onto my GDRIVE. The other Acer did not have that. I also liked that the keyboard and keys are the same size as the larger Chromebook but I wish it had a back light. The touch pad is of course smaller but I usually use a wireless mouse. Otherwise it has the same 4G of memory and quad-core processor as the larger model. I've never tried a Chromebook with lesser hardware but performance seems adequate as I can load multiple websites easily. The only thing I have not used on this Chromebook is the touch screen. I may get that chance on a trip.","This is a great computer for the price. I recently had an incident with my mac and was not looking to buy anything crazy expensive. When I first got it the main thing that bothered me was that the mouse felt sticky almost like it wasn't going. I also felt super lost because I'm used to my Mac. However, once i figured out how to change the mouse speed it was so much better. Turned it all the way up and felt normal again. The folding is very nice, kind of hard to hold it as a tablet but very neat. The google\/android apps are a really awesome addition. You can download most games you have on your phone I believe. Another thing that bothered me was that the speakers were on the bottom of the laptop and the screen feels very small and almost hard to look at at times. Adjusting the brightness helps but if you can't see good I would suggest something with a bigger screen.  My battery also seems to not last as long as advertised. while using it i'm getting more like 6 hours of use? Not sure if im doing something to drain the battery though, I'm probably just on it too much lol. TLDR; Pros: Loud speakers Bright screen Android apps Able to be folded multiple ways Affordable Touchscreen Easy to type on- keys have a little texture to them Cons: Small screen Speakers on bottom No lit keyboard Touchscreen not very sensitive Battery life not as good as advertised All in all, I am glad i purchased it. It was a great deal and it is close to my old mac book in some ways. It is definitely a change from a pc or mac to a chromebook but i'm getting used to it fast and would definitely recommend to someone looking for a casual use small laptop! You can't find many like this for such a low price!","The hardware on this Chromebook R11 Convertible is exactly what I was hoping it would be. No powerhouse, it is still quite capable of performing the tasks I got it for: Video watching, music listening, e-mail, web, and light games (i.e. Bejeweled). Sadly, ChromeOS forces me to use my Google account password. This would mean having to make my password more memorable, and therefore less secure. I am disappointed by this, and shave off a star for it. (The other unlock options, while nice, don't get around this issue entirely - leave it locked long enough, or turn it off, and it will ask for your Google password again.) I can see why many choose to replace ChromeOS with a light Linux distro, as I am tempted to do so now.","I purchased this for my daughter. She is studying for her RN and needed a laptop. After she had been using it for about two weeks she had a slim blue line going through the screen. Just as has been my experience in the past; Amazon customer service was helpful, understanding and just plain AWESOME !! Sent her a NEW (the original was new also) Acer Chromebook immediately and a return (FREE) shipping label for the defective Chromebook. You can't beat that !! Thank you Amazon. YOU ROCK !!!! She also loves this Chromebook. Works very well for her.","I received this quickly and in seemingly good shape. Fired it up and was pleased with the speed with which it started and the ease of setting it up. I am returning it though as the battery will not charge past 87% despite being plugged in for 24 hours. To me, this is a harbinger of a short battery life and I don't want to be the battery tester. I'm also a bit perturbed about the return options offered - of the 3 options I have to pay the return shipping on two of them and the other requires that I deliver it to a location on the UC San Diego campus, where parking is a virtual impossibility for anyone other than a UCSD student or employee. So I'll pay the shipping cost and shop locally for items like this from now on.","Sturdy, well built, reliable, and I love the touchscreen. The HD picture quality is much better than my old Acer Chromebook (non HD) but still not as sharp as some other brands of HD laptops. All in all though it's a really great Chromebook for the price and it fits my needs perfectly. In the future I'll have no hesitation replacing this Acer with another Acer when the need arises.","I've been using this now for about a month and love it.  Went on a trip and was able to stream Netflix and watch as a tent.  Can scroll with my hands or the touchpad.  Clear monitor, good keyboard, keeps a battery charge a long time.  So versatile.  My only complaint is that it's kind of heavy.  I was hoping for something lighter when I travel, but I suppose that's why the battery life is so good. Very happy with this Chromebook.","Very pleased with this so far. Got it on a Prime Day for a good price for my 8 year old son. I've used Chromebooks for year -- I love the Chrome OS, how fast these computers turn on, and their overall ease of use. This CB is no different - it's quick and responsive for all the basic stuff my son needs. After looking at tons of CB options, we ultimately chose this one because it offered a TOUCHSCREEN (which works really well) and because of the 360 folding options so you can use it like a normal computer, or flat, or even in tent mode. All these work great and are convenient. The screen is bright and looks good too. For just around $200 how can you go wrong? The low cost makes this a great value. We're very happy and hope the product continues to work well","I bought this in July of 2018. I've not had a problem at all with it. Everything works fine. When I didn't know about a function ( I'm used to windows) I just googled it and got the answere. Like another reveiwer said that they wished it was larger than 32 gigs, like a 64 gig would have  been better. I have a 32 gig sd card and its also great to have the google cloud for my pictures, and do I have pictures. The battery is awsome. Sorry for people who had problems. It really is a great product.","I have a couple cheap computers.  One is a 13\" bottom of the line Chromebook.  The other is an 11.6\" HP Windows computer now sporting Linux OS.  Both have had a good run.  Both have low resolution screens.  Time for something new.  I was not sure I wanted to throw in another $100 to get a new Chromebook 3 with high resolution touchscreen.  1 week later I am glad for the purchase choice.  High res touchscreen, updates in the Chromebook OS, faster processor than my other units, and the ability to run the apps from the Android Playstore which I use on my Android phone.  This unit is a win.","Was very pleased; actually really impressed. Bought it as an Amazon warehouse deal that stated the packaging would be damaged, so there was a bit of anxiety prior to powering on. What it basically meant was that the corner of the box was smooshed just a lil bit causing Amazon to have to cut the manufacturer seal on the box to inspect the contents for damage. As you know, once the seal is broken on the box that the product leaves the manufacturer, the product must be considered either used, refurbished, or sold at least at a discount price. My luck on this one. I could easily see this device being worth twice what I paid. The size is perfect, not bulky, heavy or overly thick. Actually is thinner than a Galaxy tab while inside a book type protective case. The speed for a Chromebook is phenomenal. As most of you, I am used to windows on my laptops\/desktops. The use of a mobile OS on this type of device is something I've always supported as I prefer removable memory anyway.  An external hard drive or any size SD card really opens up the potential for this 2-in-1. Screen is very responsive. I am a heavy Samsung user and the responsiveness and fluidity of the touchscreen, and the touchpad is quite similar for anyone who has become spoiled by the top of the line functionality usually paired with their devices. The reflectiveness of the screen is not a problem at all, and viewing angles are perfect for its purpose. I mean you are not going to be streaming movies for large audiences to view directly from that screen; and when I watch anything or interact with my device, I am in front of it lol. Anyway, if you are on the fence about this product, I say GO FOR IT!!! This can be a pleasant surprise as well as possibly a partnership with a manufacturer that has IMO become trouble in the eyes of Giants like Apple and Samsung, or even Dell as this is a beautiful mashup of the anchored home PC and freedom of mobile computing.","Bought this after I purchased a non touch screen one. My grandson has this and loves it so I ordered me one. I love the touch screen and brought on our recent trip and used on the plane. We were able to watch movies I downloaded and used a splitter so we could use 2 pair of headphones. It was a 5 HR flight and it had plenty of power life for entire flight then some. My new go to computer!","I've had no trouble with this unit at all...until the last major update, which introduced some touchscreen problems with only certain websites and apps.  I've found the necessary workarounds and believe eventually the driver problems will be worked out.  Having the touchscreen is incredibly useful and at this point I would never entertain buying another Chromebook that does not have one. Good design - good quality.  Sure beats the *^&ing hassle of dealing with Windows 10 !!!","After reading other reviews, the first thing I did was test the microphone and it worked fine. This is my second Chromebook and it is lighter, faster and the many display configurations make it more convenient to use than the old one. PROS The display is better than I expected. Battery life is very good. CONS Only some of the Google Play apps work on the Chromebook. The Amazon price went down 10% just after I bought, and Amazon does not offer price protection","great for what it is. its an advanced tablet, not a laptop. keep that in mind when buying as many things are different from a laptop here.","I have a few complaints about Chromebook, but my biggest complaint is that if you sign in using a school email, it will force your chromebook to be under their administrative controls. This means I am now restricted from doing things on my Chromebook that I would otherwise be able to do. It's a ridiculous system and it doesn't really give you any warnings, and I didn't realize why I was unable to do certain things until about a year after I got it, when I finally got fed up. I hear powerwashing it and using a different email solves the problem, but I'm not ready to lose all my data over this. The biggest way I see this is the fact that I am not allowed to access my google play. I would give it 3 stars, but the fact that I can so easily be forced into my schools administrative controls by simply entering an email is beyond ridiculous and the biggest of many reasons why I won't be using chromebook again.","First things first - update ChromeOS to the latest version and enable Android Apps! I love it, and my wife likes it enough to carry it for her travel days instead of her far more expensive Macbook Air The screen is very high quality, no off-angle viewing issues. The convertible aspect (use like a laptop or tablet) is fantastic. Touch works great and pinch to zoom makes most everything easy to read if it's small print without changing the browser text size. Output to a secondary monitor is easy and works as you'd expect in Windows (mirroring or extending) Storage is limited but you use SD cards to expand it. Battery life is solid, charging is fast. Huge value for the money.  Chromebooks are for real!","First time with a Chromebook, so this review could be 1 sided. But in regards to the seller and the product quality I am very satisfied. Pro: On time delivery, which is 25% the distributor and 75% the shipping company. Brand new product as listed. No scratches or any markings to be found upon first inspection. Unit was ready to go out-of-the-box with enough charge to get set up and hit the ground running. The OS experience so far is satisfactory. I knew a little of what to expect with a ChromeOS and so far I'm happy with how it feels to navigate and use. I would say it is very similar to an Android based phone (Galaxy S4+ user here) with exception to some items not yet being compatible from the Play store. Screen is crisp and undamaged. Great for watching a movie or show in bed. Hard drive size is more than enough especially if you use Google Drive for pictures. If not, it can easily interface with an external memory which would be recommended anyway if you care enough about the files. The unit appears fast and powerful for the apps it can run, but again this is my first full-time experience. Con: Touch screen isn't very touchy. Looking into adjusting this but it would appear to benefit from a stylus (not included, sadly). Even if it was more reactive to touch, a stylus would help out greatly for precision. This is something I can control, however, and is apparent for most touchscreen items such as these. And no, I do not have a screen protector (yet). Overall I would recommend this product. Cheaper than a standard laptop with more battery life and flexibility. We use Google Docs and it is great for basic word\/sheet needs plus being able to share between the family. There's not much I can say negatively about the product that isn't due to either a 3rd party app or interface. These types of cons should not reflect the overall rate in my opinion as my view of an app, like Facebook or a Camera app, is on them and something that they need to control. If you need a more powerful laptop (advanced word\/excel or gaming) then look elsewhere than a Chromebook. If you just need to use Facebook, IM, basic doc\/excel like small business owners such as us, then this is more than enough. I selected 4 stars because it takes a lot to earn 5. Namely, repeatable satisfaction. If I buy from this supplier again and I have a similar experience, then I'll consider updating.","Had issues with the keyboard from the start.  Received chrome book with defective \u201cN\u201d and \u201cSpacebar\u201d.  Both keys that would phantom enter N\u2019s or Spaces at random in text boxes.  Returning for another one and will give it another try.  For the limited time I used it as a tablet (seems to stop the keyboard from glitching),  seems pretty fast surfing the web.  Screen is excellent clarity.  Touch screen worked really well.  Audio seems ok.  It\u2019s a compact computer and  Really lightweight.","If it wasn't for the continuous problems that plagued my Chromebook only half a year into its life cycle, I'd actually enjoy this Chromebook. It functioned well, was sturdy, fast enough to use as a backup computer, and I probably wouldn't have thought anything else about it. Until the WiFi card within the laptop stops functioning about 4 months after my purchase. Annoying, yeah, but it happens that sometimes you end up with a defective product. I pay to have it shipped in, and Acer returns it to me saying they 'fixed' it. I can't tell much of a difference, but I have access to my WiFi, so I'm content. Until it breaks again 2 months later. The WiFi card, being one of the most essential parts of the Chromebook needed to do just about anything important, is defective again. I'm not sure if Acer is using cheap parts or cheap construction in their Chromebooks, but if you buy this Chromebook, expect to get quality equal to what you pay for. I would not buy this again.","First Chromebook every purchase.... I love it so far... it is fast... I love being able to access the Andriod App store... The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that you can not install apps on the SD Card.  This is not an Acer problem but a Chromebook software issue.","In looking for something to replace my tablet, i had slecifications. It needed to be easy to use, allow me to browse the internet casually, watch videos and also to have the capability to allow me to write. The battery should also br durable. This tablet naccomplished all of, however there isnt much else to do with it. Not necesarily a complaint but something to note. Its good for school and work. The only con, is the battery never reaches max capacity. It stops charging at 93%. The duration is still manymany hours, but its still strange that it never reaches max capacity. Would recomend for anyone with a casual need for a computer. It is a chromebook afterall.","I'm so disappointed in this waste of money. This Chromebook got very little use for the first nine months I had it. We recently started using it with regularity, and it just died. Literally turned off while using it and will not power back on or charge. The battery was fully charged when it died. Goodbye $250. I miss you.","Seems to be a quick, easy to use mash up of a tablet and lap top.  I like that the keyboard folds under it like a tablet.  Screen is crisp and clear.  Great for streaming movies and playing games, and easy to \u201cCast\u201d them to the TV.  Update gave me access to the Android Play Store for tons of apps.  Only complaint is the keyboard size, but I expected that due to the compact nature of this product.","We purchased this to replace a laptop that died on us earlier this year.  My son uses Chromebooks in school so we thought this would be a good fit for his school work and our casual use.  We are not gamers, don't store pictures on our computers and typically use our phones or tablets for web browsing.  When I received the item, the setup was extremely quick and simple.  It is light but feels sturdy.  The exterior has a textured finish so it doesn't feel slippery.  I don't know how long it will last or how long it will suit our needs but for the price, I'm willing to give it a try.","I fell in love with this laptop immediately. Threw away the packaging, showed it off to my friends, was so happy. Then it stopped charging 7 days after I bought it brand new. Apparently it\u2019s common for the connections inside the motherboard to become loose, making the user have to unscrew and mess with the wires inside every month or so. No thanks. I am so happy to be an Amazon prime member so I can return this rip-off junk. I fished all the packaging out of the trash. Thank you Amazon for protecting a poor college student like me. I am getting my money back and saving up for something more expensive.","I love this little machine! It works beautifully, and the touchscreen and 360* flip are amazing features to have, and make collaborating and working on projects much easier. Dinging it a star, because it *is* a bit heavier than ideal, but honestly, it's pretty worth it. I mean, most of the limitations here are that it's a chromebook, which, I mean, are pretty inherent to the whole chromebook. I do wish Microsoft would update the Office apps, though if you've got Office 365 you can just use the browser-based programs for most things. Otherwise, it works beautifully, and it's a great hybrid between laptop and tablet.","I am using this right now! LOVE this computer. Fast, small, convenient, no problems. If you love Google - this is the computer for you. I thought I would miss downloading software, but I am just online so much, I don't even miss my old programs. Google does everything. The Android apps do everything. It is like using my phone, without the phone calls (I even set up texting on this computer). IT IS AWESOME!","I got this computer a month ago. It is a good looking computer. I love this white computer. I like I can use it as a lap top or as a tablet. It is not heavy laptop and I can download any app I want. The battery last for a couple days. What I dont know is if you dont use it for a couple days, the battery  is supposed to run out (?). But is ok with me I just use the cable. I am very familiar to Windows but not a Chrome, so I am just getting acostume to it.  I am 95% satisfied with it. The issues that I have had is with the keyboard. I write some projects in Spanish and the keyboard doesnt work with the keys Ctrl + alt to put accents to the vowels and others signs. I have tried in the menu settings to change it to  international keyboard also to spanish language without sucess. So what I do is puting accents to vowels by using the computer in tablet mode and works prefectly like a cellphone. The other issue is that in some apps or programms the key ENTER doesnt work to be used like GO or SEARCH, so I have to use the Icone Search to get me through some websites. Despite of these issues I am happy with this computer so far.","This really is an impressive device.  It was incredibly easy to setup, just entered my Google account info, followed the tutorial, and I was able to start using it.  It had one update after the first reboot that took a matter of 30 seconds.  After 94 Windows updates on my PC which took 4 hours, it was refreshing.  I am very disappointed however that there are not dedicated Delete and CAPS lock keys.  Even in typing this review, I have hit the  \"search\" key which lives in the spot for the Caps Lock key 3 times in error.  Pressing a combination of alt-Search does enable the Caps Lock, but it is unnatural feeling and slows my pace\/focus.  Same for Delete (alt-backspace).  I purchased this primarily for writing, and yes I will adjust to an extent, but I will always have a Windows machine at the office because that is simply the way of business.  So I don't know if I'll fully adjust.  Despite that, I'm still happy with the purchase.  Just wish I would have known that this was something necessary to research beforehand.","I love this little guy. I'm actually typing this review on it now! Of course it doesn't have the power of a full laptop, it's a netbook, but it does still run Linux on top of Chrome reliably and fast enough to work with using Crouton. Touchscreen isn't the greatest ever, but i have used it to sign documents without the need for printing and scanning... so it is good enough for me. Access to the entire Play Store is also awesome. (This is the Celeron w\/4G RAM). Tip: If you plan on using developer mode, make sure you redeem any chromebook offers FIRST!","I really loved this little thing. It was faster and so much more convenient than I expected it to be. Which is why it was a bummer when I tried plugging in headphones for the first time and audio came through only one headphone. I thought it was probably just an issue with my headphones, so I tried another pair. And another. Then called Acer to see if there was a known issue that I could fix in the software - no dice. They told me I would have to send it back for a repair team to diagnose. Unfortunately it wasn't worth waiting the amount of time they quoted me, so I returned the defective unit and bought a similar product elsewhere.","Instant on and instant off. And the chrome browser is fully functional. The battery life is legitimately long, even when used to watch HBO Now videos. The 180 degree hinge and rotating display is surprisingly versatile and useful. The touch screen and trackpad aren't great. Typing is good. One weird thing, though, is the lack of a Caps Lock button, which is instead replaced by a universal search button. The AC charger is okay:  light in weight but decidedly old school and boring. ultimately you can't want much more for the low low price. Very happy with this purchase. And won't care if this doesn't last me more than a couple years and is mostly left unused.","Very disappointed, I purchased the Acer Covertible after my Acer C720 screen cracked. I have been a Acer user for many years, the problem with this one is the battery only charges up to 91% though the one day it did go up to 92% giving me only about 6 hrs of use. Playing games online is hit and miss, had to wait a whole day to play a game on Facebook because it kept on crashing. I will be returning this and getting someone other chromebook that's not Acer.","Hands down the best Chromebook I have used. I bought this for a family member who didn't want a full computer, just something that worked on the internet and some light games. With the introduction of the Google Play Store into the OS I felt this would be the right purchase. Solid price for a solid Chromebook for anyone who doesn't need a full computer. The full HDMI is an added bonus as it can be easily plugged into your television, which may sound useless, unless you add in the fact that Sling TV, Netflix, Hulu and a wide range of apps can be installed on it. I highly recommend this product."],"22":["Ok, just to get everything out in one sentence: This is the perfect laptop for the CASUAL laptop user! Which is a good thing! This is a great little laptop! for $200 this is a steal. 64 gigabytes is enough for windows 10. If you get a 128GB mini SD card, then this laptop will work great for you. Now if you plan on using this to store pictures, videos and other files, for awhile, then you will run out of space (with the laptop alone). But with a mini SD card or a flash drives to store your files, you'll be fine. If you are a heavy computer user and need it for heavy video editing, photoshop or a heavy gamer, then obviously this won't work for you. I use windows movie maker. It works just fine. This can play light games or games that have been released from the early 2000's (if you play on Steam).. Newer games that need Gforce and what not.. Obviously not. This laptop is for the casual user, but can hold its grounds when using other programs. I have used adobe elements for video editing.. Does it work. yes, it does! is it the best computer to use it on.. haha, no. But it does work on this laptop, though this isn't the idea computer you'd used a program on like this. But if you're on a tight budget and don't mind the laptop taking a few extra moments to process everything, then go for it. The keyboard and the mouse pad works like butter. I love typing on this thing. I've typed on several 11.6\" laptops and had trouble, but I have no problem typing on this. GREAT LAPTOP and VERY HAPPY!!","I was sent an L203MA. From the first moment, the touchpad was weird.  It only was accurate when I started the curser when my finger was 1\/2 inch from base of the track pad. Now that may have fixable software problem, but the downloaded driver files specific to this model would not work with it as recommended by ASUS as a possible fix.  Now that problem was nothing compared to my main complaint. The From the manufacturer description in Amazon said that this model came with a backlit keyboard. In the ASUS FAQ and later confirmed by the ASUS Chat representative, it did not. I am returning this unit today.  I have never given a one star rating and am doing this to make sure that others be aware of the inaccurate description provided in the item\u2019s description.","This is the only ultra-book I could find with a 64gb ssd, 4gb RAM, weighed only 2 pounds (actually 2.1) and cost $200.  If your expectations are reasonable (i.e. don't expect to find a large screen, don't expect to run intense programs or games) then I think you will be happy with this. The notebook comes with Windows 10S (not windows 10) which can be upgraded free and easily.  If the upgrade is not made, then you are limited to the programs\/apps in windows' store which is not very comprehensive.  The only issue here is that the Windows 10 version the upgrade goes to is 64 bit (not 32) which has compatibility issues with some older programs. I found the eMMC disk drive to be fast, the computer boots in a few seconds.  There is a Micro SD slot.  256GB micro sd card is only around $25 and is immensely helpful in increasing available storage (buy a name brand only; i.e. microcenter, sandisk, pny, crucial, kingston, etc etc).  The internal eMMC drive or the RAM can not be upgraded. WiFi is strong, the screen is only 11.5\" but is very bright and has very good resolution and color.  The USB ports are V 3.x.  The keyboard does not feel cramped or compromised in any way despite the small size of the notebook.  Too bad it does not have a trackpoint which would be very helpful in navigating more precisely on the small screen. I have only had this so far for a week so I can not comment on durability.  The card slot seems a bit flimsy. I have been unable to get anything near the \"whole day\" claim on a battery charge.  6 hours is about it but obviously that is still very good. Overall I believe this is a very good choice especially for this price range; this laptop is not much heavier than a tablet but is much more useful.  Also, Windows 10 is far more versatile than the Chrome OS, in my opinion anyway.","I bought this on Prime day to replace an android tablet. Wanted something a little more capable, yet portable. I installed several Linux distros without a hitch. Settled on Mint 19. It's rock stable and runs smooth as butter. I added a 200gb micro sd for data storage and have a 2 tb slim USB HD for more extensive things like video. I haven't found much that this mighty mouse will not do. If you need am inexpensive portable Linux machine, look no further. All you kind folks having winows problems on this laptop, save yourself a boat load of headaches and jump off the Microsoft bandwagon. Try linux.  Mint is a great place to start. It will easily handle your web, office and email. I have even edited photos with the (free) equivalent of Photoshop and Lightroom  ... GIMP and Darktable. I understand that there is a place for Windows et al on a more capable machine, but for something this light and portable I have not found a better way to go.","Would give this item 0 stars if possible- needed a small travel computer for a trip I was taking- thought this would be perfect in place of outdated Chromebook I had previously. Received it in seemingly new condition- used it for two days and tried to turn it on on the day we were leaving, and NOTHING- wouldn't charge, turn on, ZERO. (yes, I tried all the tricks) Thankfully was able to run to UPS to return for a full refund (thanks Amazon Prime!), and picked up a slightly larger device (from a different manufacturer) at Best Buy.","I really, really like this little gizmo. Looks good, feels as solid as one can expect, nice response feel on the keys, crisp display and bright, and lightning fast... for a reason. First things first, I ripped Windows out of this mini laptop shortly after powering it up. Why? Windows is a memory and resource hog. Secondly, the amount of information they want just to run the laptop outside Windows S mode is ridiculous. Hence, Windows had to go, so it I took it out. In place of Windows I installed Manjaro Linux, based off the Arch Linux distro, using the Xcfe interface system. Both are considered light weight and just seemed perfect for this mini laptop. The OS slid right in without a single problem, it picked up all the hardware on boot-up, and the response times proved better than I hoped. As a test of the battery, I loaded up Youtube with 15 hours of videos and let it run. After nearly exhausting the 15 hours of videos, the laptop battery finally gave up. It impressed me since it played for 14 hours and 27 minutes non-stop. Moreover, the speakers sounded much better than I thought they would. A little tinny, but what could anyone really expect? The laptop never got too warm, either, considering it is a fanless system. It just powered through without a hiccup. After ten days of regular use it seems rock solid. The shakedown period ran without a hitch. The distro comes with automatic updates, so the OS is kept fresh and update. The WiFi range is quite good. I remained connected to my WiFi for just about fifty feet, and the signal needed to pass through walls. The camera is okay, but to be honest I do not use it much if at all. I simply tested it. At just over two pounds, it travels well in my backpack and I use it during my commutes to and from the office. LibreOffice runs like a champ. GIMP runs like a champ. Audicty runs like a champ. KPatience is quick and fun. Firefox with extensions is incredibly fast... faster than on my main desktop. This is a great little mini laptop and, with the Manjaro OS changes, is worth more than purchase price. I highly recommend it since it proved so amenable to modification. I would definitely buy again.","I bought the ASUS Vivo book to replace an HP Stream I purchased at a local chain. As an author, albeit not well-known, I use a laptop primarily for writing. I also create my own graphics and maintain my website. The Stream quickly ran out of  storage space, making it a constant (weekly) endeavor to free up space. Then - the death knoll. Not enough space to update Windows 10, and Microsoft would no longer offer service or support for my version of 10. I was unfamiliar with ASUS, having located the Vivo on Amazon. The specs were sufficient for my needs. The bonus of Office 365 for a year was a plus as a 19-year user of Office. Slim and lightweight, easy to carry. Graphics are good, as is sound and compatibility with my desktop. The most impressive feature to me? Power on to ready to use is 10 seconds. The Stream took 30-45 and my aging desktop - up to 2 minutes. For $190 dollars, I am as pleased as I've ever been with a laptop\/notebook. I'm even getting used to Windows 10, and I love the Cloud storage. I would recommend to someone on a budget or if your looking for a fast and efficient laptop\/notebook, (a pretty nice option)>","I bought this laptop to leave at work so I can log on to World of Warcraft during my lunch break everyday and work on my character(s) professions. (I installed WoW on a MicroSD card since the 64GB internal drive is not enough room.) I was skeptical WoW would even run, but it does! I turn all the graphics settings all the way down, and get anywhere from 10-45 FPS in the open world, and 5-15 FPS in the cities. This might be my best purchase ever! I cannot wait for WoW Classic!","ASUS makes great products and when it comes to electronics every now and then you get one that doesn't work. This was my case.. The instruction manual recommends charging for at least 3 hours before running it off the battery alone. I let it charge for close to four hours and it said it was 100% fully charged. BUT when I unpluged the power cord the unit shut right off. And it would not start up unless I plug the power cord back in. I'm guessing the battery was bad or something along those lines.. Anyways, While I had it plugged in and powered up it seemed to be really nice... It was fast. Setup was easy. It has an excellent display and sound. I have nothing negative to say about this laptop other than the one I received was a lemon and would not power up unless it was plugged in. I ended up returning it the next day and ordered a different laptop. later I'll probably order another one of these, hopefully getting one that works right and I'll do a proper tech review on it.","Ok, so you're tired of carrying around the 100 plus pound laptop when you go on vacation or need to make a presentation. Well, I was there too.  This 11.6 in screen ASUS Vivobook L203MA  2 + lbs laptop is great !  It's similar in size to a Chrombook but this has Windows10 home. It's in \"S\" mode (safe) which protects you from outside attacks.  The downfall on that is that you're going to want to add some of your programs which will require you to remove the system out of \"S\" mode.  (super easy). One important thing.... I highly recommended spending a little more $ to get the 4GB RAM and 64GB storage model..  It's going to cost a little more but highly recommended !! I also bought along with this a wireless mouse.  I also recommended the Sabrent 4-Port USB 3.0 Hub with Individual LED Power Switches (HB-UM43) . I'm able to plug in my USB CD player, wireless mouse button, and what ever other USB you'll use. In short, I am totally happy with my setup and love the portability for traveling.","I ordered this at the beginning of August 2019, and when I received my order, I saw the laptop and thought \"oh great, this will be useful and handy this year for school.\" It's not a big laptop or anything or very fancy, but its description suited me as a low-income student. Then I tried to use the laptop, only to find out that the version of Windows 10s that was supposed to be on the laptop was a bootlegged version, which heavily affected the usability of my laptop. I have now returned said laptop, but with all the hassle that comes with this, please don't get it. Spare yourself whatever pain.","Bought this laptop just over 1 month ago. It worked just as expected for the first ~30 days and now it won't turn on. No indication of any problems and I barely used it. It just stopped working. Will be trying to fix it, but I'm not feeling hopeful. Do not recommend this.","Bought this computer and within 3 weeks it went dead. Made a couple of attempts to rectify through the ASUS website but their site doesn't recognize the serial number and won't let you lodge a complaint without it. This is the second ASUS like this that I've wasted money on. HP - Dell are way better options and much better support. This ASUS is junk. don't waste your money. If you could get decent support it might be different.","This didn't work on arrival - it wouldn't do anything. Amazon said they'd call me back the next day but didn't. When I messaged them, they offered a refund...the absolute least they could do. Disappointed with both the product and the service.","Used it for one day (received it in the mail yesterday). I setup everything on the computer and within one day, yes one day the computer has stopped working. The computer wont turn on and no led lights are on meaning the computer wont start or even run. Very disappointing","I bought this little nap book for my 10-year-old son so he can do his schoolwork, his school already get some Microsoft word for free, but it does come with a subscription. He plays a game that we installed called the adventure Academy that is educational. And he seems to play Roblox just fine. We haven\u2019t used it much without it being plugged in at his computer desk, but it is very light and portable, we actually use something very similar in the school systemA great portable notebook for grade school and elementary school kids. I recommend using an online drive like Microsoft one drive, Google Drive to store your files and to free up space. This is no bigger than a sheet of printer paper, which makes it very convenient to fit in the backpacks, I do recommend using a laptop sleeve when storing it in a backpack","What computer two months ago five days after return date will not turn on asking for help from Amazon or seller spent a little over $200 and looking for help or guidance this computer just is not working I will change my review based on helping me or figuring out what the problem is but this is bad business to spend money for a computer does not work please call me at 781","Wow wow wow. I can't find enough good things to say about this portable powerhouse. I'm a pretty hardcore gamer who also uses a lot of graphics intensive programs like Photoshop and Unreal 4. This laptop... is not for that. It's for those times away from your high-end programs, where you need 10 chrome tabs open in a coffee shop while you're experimenting with Microsoft Word layouts. It's for when you're out in the woods and want to sort and organize the photos on your camera's SD right then and there. It's for trips where you want to travel light, but still want the world at your finger tips. OK, OK, enough flowery language. Let's get to the pros \/ cons: Pros: -The keyboard feels great, with a nice balance of being chunky and \"clicky\" while still being compact. Once you get used to its size, it's pretty easy to get close to your fastest typing speeds with minimal errors. -This thing is really light. Maybe I'm too sued to heavier laptops, but seriously, this thing is effortless to bring around. Throw it in a backpack, tuck it under your shoulder, do whatever. This thing is pretty durable from what I can tell, so all that lightness doesn't come at the cost of having to gingerly secure it in a special compartment. Any ol' laptop bag \/ pocket will do! -The battery life is great! Maybe I'm too used to being tethered to outlets by more power-hungry machines, but I was able to get hours of typing and Chromeing out of this thing. The key I've found (as with most machines) is to keep the brightness a bit low when you're not plugged it, it can make a big difference. -ASUS has always made my favorite laptops and this one is no exception. If you're a fan of ASUS' work, you'll find everything you know and love about and ASUS packed into a tiny package. -The ports, lordy, the ports! So many ports in such a tiny machine. -The screen is far brighter and more colorful than I was expecting. My other laptop is a \"state-of-the-art\" ROG Strix II, with a high color accuracy, high refresh-rate display... the issue is they never calibrate said displays and they always end up coming out sickly yellow, requiring hours of manual adjusting. Not this little fighter though! Bright and beautiful right out of the box! Color pureists will notice things can get a bit washed out, but it's certainly preferable to the yellow tint of other machines. -The price is the best I've seen for the quality of machine you're getting. This thing is durable, sturdy and built for a few specific things it excels at. It's definitely given my productivity a boost and is well worth the investment. -There was pretty minimal bloatware on the machine, which was great. -Office 360 for a year is a HUGE plus. Also be sure to upgrade the machine to full Windows 10 (from S), the process is free, fast and jarringly painless. Cons: -Even 64 GBs is not a a huge amount of space. This is definitely more of a document and cloud oriented device. If you're hoping to put your entire music library on this thing you're going to need to expand the storage. If storage isn't an issue, than this is probably the book for you! -Similarly the 4 GBs of RAM can make this little engine chug sometimes. Don't expect it to be happy with running 20 chrome tabs at once,n or for it to instantly load pages the moment you click them. It's certainly fast enough, but as someone who's coming from a 16 GB machine the little differences can be noticeable. -The touch pad is ... OK. It's not terrible, but (much like all touch pads these days) it loses tracking now and then and lacks any real buttons for the left and right. I never much enjoyed touch pads to begin with so maybe I'm biased. Closing thoughts: If you like what you've read, read more reviews and honestly take the dive. If you're looking for a durable portable typer, that can do a little bit of everything this is your machine! More closing thoughts: A story for you, about ASUS laptops... In winter I got an ROG Strix II, a very powerful and very pricey machine. It was maddening getting the thing to work properly. Getting photoshop to play nice with the dual graphics. Getting the screen to not look yellow. Getting the damn speakers to not crank the bass. Many of these issues are still unresolved and frankly though I love the hardware I'm more than likely going to have to start from square one with that thing. I was all emotionally prepared to go through the same process with this little trail-blazer. I was ready to troubleshoot and troubleshoot and finally get something that mostly did what I needed. To my absolute delight, this machine seems to be the last bastion of PCs that do everything right, everything the way they're supposed to, right out of the box. I haven't had to troubleshoot a single thing about this beautiful laptop and honestly couldn't be happier. If you're looking for something portable, something durable, something to up your productivity and most of all something easy to work with, this is the laptop for you.","I needed a typewriter with internet access for school and got just that for less than $200. Videos take a few extra seconds to a minute to upload and all my files are saved to the cloud, backed up on a 32 GB microSD. I haven't owned a computer in years, what can't you do on a smartphone or tablet? This fit the niche for a compact device with a full keyboard and screen large enough to split between Word and researching online journals. Only dig, wishing it had a backlit keyboard as I do most of my work at night and the smaller keyboard messes with my muscle memory.","Just be careful if you care how it looks, the cover scars easily, I carried this in a nylon stuff sack in a backpack.  The laptop was next to my back and it's top, the glossy top, was next to a camera in a camera bag with 1\/2\" of foam between its inner and outer nylon material.  The camera is expensive so the whole kit was treated gently but the cover of this laptop got abraded by contact with the camera through 3 layers of nylon and 1\/2\" of foam.  The only pressure was the weight of the camera and the mutual weight of the items pressing against each other in a lightweight strings-for-straps type backpack.  The gloss of the cover was abraded so it has random marks on it, disappointing when I was treating it about as well as practicable.  I guess I could leave it at home in its box.","The max resolution is 1366 x 768 and not the advertised 1920 x 1080 pixels. The processor speed is 1.1 GHz instead of the advertised 2.6 GHz.","I needed to replace my old Gateway netbook so I gave this one a try, and liked it so much I immediately bought a second for my partner.  The first thing I did for both was to rip out Windows and put a proper OS in place, in this case Arch Linux, which installed without a single hiccup. Admittedly this is not a powerful computer.  However, for daily tasks (web, email, IM, music\/video, office, web editing, coding) it's pretty ideal.  It's very light, has excellent battery life and a responsible keyboard, and with a lightweight DE (i3 or xfce) it doesn't give me any trouble even with several dozen browser tabs open. In short, a great little computer for my needs at a great price.","This ASUS vivobook is small, light, and efficient, great for computer use on the move, especially when weight is an issue.  It isn't the equivalent of a desktop or a larger, more powerful laptop, but it may do until you can get to one.  Internet access and word processing is pretty good.  This reviewer is not a gamer, but the graphics seem decent.  Recommended for limited purpose.","This is a descent low end laptop.  Of course it is not a powerhouse gaming or video editing platform.  Still it fits a light weight easy to handle laptop niche.  You can think of this unit as Netbook\/NetTop. This was bought to surf the Internet, watch some Youtube, and type up some documents from time-to-time.  These tasks are handled well by this Asus model.  I would not use this unit as a primary platform and again it isn't for serious gaming or video production. In my case I installed Ubuntu MATE 18.04 LTS and everything worked with zero manual configuration.  The system was paired with an external dongle for a RJ45 connection and added port capacity.","You get what you pay for.... this laptop really is more of a Microsoft attempt at Chromebook.  It doesn't run Google.com or other No Microsoft things. To run TurboTax you have to pay extra for an app from the Microsoft store!  Even office software is a subscription service on the cloud (which I knew going in).  So this will be going back...my Chromebook is more user friendly. I wanted a laptop for things like office and TurboTax which Chromebook doesn't do... but this laptop cannot do them either.","I paid $190.19 for this, which is almost cheaper than the software itself. Boot-up is fast, within 5 seconds. It does everything I need it to and everything I'd ever need it to. Keyboard is solid, size is smaller than a standard textbook, case is seemingly durable. Programs such as Word start up quickly, edge browser is very quick on a high speed connection.","Started school and have a couple of online classes so I bought this so I can work on homework\/reading at work during my lunch and so I can take it on the go if I leave town. It's a very convenient size and I'm really liking the keyboard. I'm used to clacking away on the keyboard for my PC, but these are much softer, but you still get the \"I pressed it\" feel and sound.  I don't mind the Windows 10 S at all since I'm not really interested in downloading a bunch of apps. Usually use google chrome, but Microsoft Edge isn't bad at all.","Perfect for writing and quick internet access when you need to install your own software but don't want to shell out the big bucks for a full sized laptop.  It's lightweight, decent speakers, and fits in an oversized purse or small backpack. The keyboard is tinier than a full sized one but any keyboard fit for an 11.6'' screen would be. This beats buying a tablet and keyboard for me. I suggest buying this as a secondary travel laptop and not as a primary PC unless all you want to do is surf the web and install a few small programs.","I bought this so I would have a small computer to take with me to write and surf elsewhere. I work in my office all day and didn't want to stay in there after work on the desktop. I didn't need anything fancy. Just a reliable laptop for word processing and occasional surfing. It's perfect for those needs.","I was impressed at first, needed to by a Windows based laptop to run a certain program I need for my business. Tried to turn it on today and nothing, power adapter cable plugged in, dead. So Amazon is great and they are sending me another one asap. I hope this is just one of those things that this ASUS was defective. I have built many computers in the past using ASUS motherboards and they were bullet proof. This lasted 4 days!!!","Not a touch screen, cannot use Chrome. I can't review anything else because I'm too disappointed I was misled. EDIT I never initiated a return, yet there is a return status on my account. I don't know if this is Amazon being wonky or if the seller is. I AM considering a return, as the laptop has all these apps for touch screen (including on screen keyboard) but no touch screen functionality.","This was my first laptop and I just love this. My daughter set my laptop up and was able to switch it from Windows S so I can put my anti virus on my laptop. The pages run quickly.  I read other reviews some were helpful so for now this is enough for me","I like this notebook, very lightweight and easy to use. I like the features it comes with, although I did update to windows home. Only issue I have is this thing is constantly updating. Not a bad thing, but I live in a rural area, using antennae based broadband, and it takes forever to update. I have made one trip to the local library, and again at a car dealer while waiting for a repair to be done. The wifi in those places is much faster than I get at home, but it is what it is. Primary use is as a back up or for traveling, so it's OK for use in those situations.","Had to send it back battery dose not charge","When I retired I no longer needed a full size computer. I bought this little guy for ease of carry on trips, but still accommodate printing and other peripherals. It was also priced right. It does the trick and I would recommend it to anyone who travels and needs  an easy to carry computer that provides excellent functionality.","I am so thoroughly pleased with my purchase, I cannot likely begin to adequately cover it to make the point I optimally would about the darling thing. It is powerful, small, lightweight, easy-to-use anywhere and more. If you want a perfect laptop to carry with you when preferred, this is the one - and for the price? It's great even at a much higher one, so that is just ANOTHER gift!","I love this little computer. Its small but packed with very useful apps and bells and whistles. Its very convienent , it has some weight to it but its not too heavy. My favorite option is voice to text so I dont have to do the typing. As a author its great to just speak my mind and it catches it an keeps up with me. It linked with my cloud from my old computer and my phone and loaded up all my data on its own.","Great for taking minutes at work and the keys are easy to use. However, the internet speed is slower than dial up and it's to time consuming to use for internet research. Returning!","Did not realize this but this laptop came with Windows Home 10 S which doesn't allow you to download and install any un-approved software not in the Microsoft Store; Google Chrome is not approved.  So it took me hours of frustration just to install my Google Chrome.","I initially liked everything about this computer. Unfortunately, just a few months in and I am having problems. First, the security icon in my task bar indicated a \"quick scan\" was due. When I clicked the button to scan, nothing happened after several minutes of the little blue dots going across the screen indicating the computer was working. This happened after several attempts to scan the computer. Then, I shut it down and restarted it and the security icon showed everything was up to date. Thought my problem was resolved, that is until a few minutes passed and I was back to showing a scan was needed. No help from Windows tech support worked to resolve this issue. The next day after using the computer for a few hours all of a sudden I could not enter my password after the computer went into sleep mode. This computer is now worthless to me! Very disappointed and going to spend the extra money to buy a Mac!","It\u2019s a very basic tiny laptop.  I wanted a Lenovo 2 in 1 but the one ordered arrived with 4 keys that didn\u2019t function.  I ordered this as a replacement. In a world of touch screen laptops and tablets this isn\u2019t one.  The entire shell feels very cheap.  It will probably be fine for what I bought it for ( reading and storing old business emails ) but I\u2019ll never love it. I wish Lenovo 2 in 1 wasn\u2019t garbage","This laptop has all the spec that I need for the non-compute intensive tasks of my day as a software engineer. I love having this one for when I'm on the go, but I still want to be in my editor.","It is a little slower than I expected, but I'm not a Gamer and I don't watch videos or put any heavy use on it. Honestly, I pay bills, cruise the internet, check my email, do a little research. It is light, charges quickly, and does everything I need it for. When I'm ready to replace it I will invest in a little more speed, but for now, I'm very happy.","Great when it works and was the ideal little laptop to take on business trips.  BUT.....  The computer DIED after 35 days and was temperamental before then (grey screen, flickering screen, apps closing unexpectedly).  NOT impressed with ASUS.  Thankfully I have a MAC as 'backup'.  Going through the warranty process now.....","We've been buying netbooks for over 10 years, and this is the first one that works as smoothly as my MacBook. If you're like us and prefer to do certain tasks on a PC, I would highly recommend this inexpensive but smooth netbook. Shout-out to Asus for taking pride in their product.","I like it. Good for an inexpensive PC. Not great but very light and portable. I like the thinness. The computer works okay but it\u2019s a lot different from a typical laptop PC.","I\u2019m so disappointed. I really wanted this laptop and then it went on prime day for a great price but it\u2019s missing a key hardware component that you need to go on the internet.","The computer is new, so it\u2019s hard to give it a review right away. So far I like the size and lightness of the product. Seems fairly simple to find what I need. I needed something small and this seems to work perfect. Mostly using it for surfing the internet and research.","Thought I got a good deal.. But unfortunately not.. Used it for one day and now it won't start up.. Very small computer as well.. It ran good.. But I guess it has some bugs.. Thanks again Will be returning today... Sept28 2019","Battery doesn\u2019t hold a charge after 5 weeks of use. Has to be plugged in to use. I would not recommend!","I absolutely love this laptop perfect size light as they say easy to put in any bag and I can get all my work done on it the keypad is wonderful there's so much I could say about this laptop I love and and for the price you can't beat it.","I needed a small laptop to run linux for some couch programming. It seems perfect for that purpose. I'm dropping one star due to it not supporting the 1920 x 1080 pixels resolution as stated on the details page.","Great size, perfect for college taking notes, quick start up","I needed a notebook type laptop for the weight - or in this case - the lack of! I can use it comfortably on my lap. Took me a bit to get used to keyboard but once I got my arthritic fingers aligned it was a breeze. I don't need a workhorse, but wanted a Windows based notebook. Also easy to switch to regular Windows 10.","I have this put away for a Christmas gift for my husband, but during set up, I thought it was very easy to use.","Smaller than what I expected but just as advertised. The screen doesn\u2019t seem as bright or crisp as I\u2019d like but I was a Mac user previously so.

The 512 GB SSD feels fast and speedy. The 16Gb of fast ram is nice. The i7 processor is a beast, with speed (and noisy fan) bursts when needed. This is a fast, well-optioned machine inside. The screen is nice and the 14 inch size is a nice compromise vs the larger 15.6 and 13 inch sizes. The chicklet keyboard is reasonable, and it is backlit which is a very nice touch. The fingerprint detector has been working reliably for me, but that isn't a feature that I care a lot about. I'm fine with logging into my computer with a PIN code or webcam. The Acer Spin 3 Convertible Laptop, 14\" Full HD IPS Touch, 8th Gen Intel Core i7-8565U, 16GB DDR4, 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD, Backlit KB, Fingerprint Reader, SP314-53N-77AJ has a rechargeable active stylus, which is not - in my opinion - up to the task of doing artwork on a computer. It IS fine for note-taking and rough drawing, but for serious art-work I think it needs to be better. Still, it is definitely a nice touch. So what is my big beef with the Acer Spin 3? THE CONNECTIVITY OPTIONS ARE SERIOUSLY LACKING!. There is NO USB-C. If you aren't familiar with USB-C (I wasn't until recently) it is the connector of all connectors. A SINGLE USB-C can be used to add almost dozens of different devices to your computer. A $50 hub can be plugged into a USB-C port and it can support external hard drives, internet ports, HDMI output, headphone jacks, card readers and even charge other devices. A single small USB-C port makes your laptop able to connect to so many more devices. Without one, you limited in so many ways . The Acer Spin 3 comes with only a COUPLE of standard USB ports and a card reader, a headphone jack and an HDMI output. I am constantly trying to plug devices into my laptops and needing more ports, and the Acer Spin 3 just doesn't have many. Another interesting (good) thing about the Acer Spin 3 is that the wall wart or transformer for this computer is very small compared to most of my laptops. It is only 2.4 amps and about 45 watts, which isn't very much really. You could run this off of a good sized powerbank if you had to for a bit. I was torn on how to rank this on stars. On one hand, I am very disappointed in the limitations that the Acer 3 has on connectivity. On the other hand, it is a speedy little devil that is pretty competent at computing. If you are using this in a work environment where you need to do spreadsheets, e-mail, word processing and even photoshop type editing, it is a pretty nice machine with very respectable specs, speed and parts list. If you are looking for something super creative, where you can plug in several things like external hard drives, or drawing pads, or you want an awesome screen - you are going to be frustrated by the lack of USB-C. I'm going with four stars. It is a very good computer. But if it had even just one USB-C port, it would have been a great computer. I hope you find this review helpful. I feel like that reviews are super important on Amazon and they really help me determine if a product is worth buying or not - so I try to return the favor and leave a review that will honestly tell you whether a product is good or not. We all use products differently, so I also try to make it clear what was important to me, and hopefully that makes it easy for you to tell if you will like it too. I also think it is important for Amazon shoppers to stick together and let each other know if a product is garbage. I WILL let you know if a product isn't good, so you can avoid the hassles of returning a product or a product you lose money on. PLEASE go to my profile page and reach out to me if you have any questions. I enjoy writing reviews and try to respond to any questions about a product ASAP. Thank you for reading my review.","I\u2019ve used a lot of Mac and PC laptops in the past, and this particular model of the Spin 3 is my favorite for work so far. As a photographer and videographer, my work demands a lot of RAM and processing power, and that is where this PC excels. I can have Photoshop and Lightroom open at once, working back and forth between both programs, and the computer keeps up beautifully. The included rechargeable pen works with the full Adobe suite without any setup required \u2014 and it\u2019s even pressure-sensitive! Extremely handy and natural feeling. The Spin 3 IS powerful enough to edit big projects in Premiere Pro, but after a certain point, some lag becomes inevitable. Still, I am surprised it handles large files as well as it does. I usually work with extremely large 4K videos formatted in ProRes CODEC, and the Spin handles them without any programs crashing. The downside of this PC, however, is its integrated graphics card. While cheaper and more energy-efficient, an integrated GPU is a great deal slower than a dedicated GPU when it comes to video editing, gaming, and other graphics-intensive tasks. So despite its fantastic processor and RAM, the Spin is just short of being the workstation it could be. The fan also blasts much louder than any other laptop I\u2019ve used, even with just a browser and a few tabs open, and it gets pretty hot. However, despite its disadvantages, the Spin 3 remains powerful enough to work on the go, and if necessary, at least get a start on projects that can be finished on more powerful computers later. It features a beautiful touchscreen display, a good trackpad, an SD card reader, and a keyboard that feels pretty similar to older MacBooks. I would summarize it as a mid-level workstation \u2014 not quite as powerful as it could be, but more than adequate for dozens of professional tasks. I highly recommend it! There is not much to complain about.","I was a bit hesitant to buy based on all the \"bought\" Vine reviews. But the great price n specs I couldn't pass up. Very fast and has a beautiful and responsive touch screen. The Ad says 12 hour battery life but it only lasts 6 hours so can't give it 5 stars. And the fingerprint reader didn't work well for me so I just use a pin to login. Seems well built and very light. The fan noise is average. Pleased with this purchase.","Despite my first dismal experience with amazon\u2019s shipping with the product arriving late and looking like it had been dropped kicked, my initial experience with the laptop. Speed: This boy is equipped with one of the fastest ssd\u2019s available at a respectable size, 16gb of ram (a must in todays era), and a 4 core 8 thread processor. This cpu tends to score a 4787 on single threaded loads and a 13130 on multithreaded loads accourding to geekbench. \"Geekbench 4 scores are calibrated against a baseline score of 4000 (which is the score of an Intel Core i7-6600U). Higher scores are better, with double the score indicating double the performance.\" My particular machine scored a 5259 on the single threaded test and a 15849 on the multithreaded. It should also be considered that i had firefox running at the time of my tests which was utilizing around 5% of my cpu. The screen: the screen is beautiful and has amazing viewing angles as most ips panels, though when compared to my Pixio PX275H, which has a high color gambit, the colors did appear to be slightly more muted. The hinges are great when comparing it to a family members asus notebook that was bought earlier this year. Unlike the asus it doesnt lock up in odd orientations. The touch screen is responsive and the pen is adequate for light photoshop work. The pen does lack the capability for the finer details and the buttons on it lack any meaningful programability. The brightness is average. Not the brightest screen ive seen but certainly not the dullest. I used mine at about 40% in a well lit room and 60-70% in a sunlit room. Battery life: at a balanced setting and an average use case this will last about 6 hours. This time can be increased if you use the optimal battery saving options and set the gpu to prioritize battery life when the system is unplugged. The keyboard and touchpad: this keyboard feels amazing! Its nice and solid and the keys are firm and dont wiggle. The backlight is nice and crisp\u2014but not over bearing\u2014and can be turned off. The touch pad is large and responsive and handles all the gestures excellently. The finger scanner is just as fast as touch id on my iphone 6s which is nice. The io: only 2 usbs? Not even a type c? Why acer! It would be more acceptable if both usbs were 3.1 but one of the usbs is a 2.0 which has way slower speeds. (When compared to its 10gbps 3.1 brethren) That port is basically only useful for a mouse dongle. It does have a sd card reader which is nice, but it juts out too far in my opinion. It could have easily been designed to fit more snugly into the system upon viewing the interior of the system. The full size hdmi is a plus and the powerbrick for the laptop is super small. The power connector also swivels for optimal placement. Gaming: this is not a gaming machine. This machine shines brightest in its productivity workloads. The integrated graphics should be able to run most competitive games like rocket league, csgo, fortnite, and overwatch at low to medium settings. It can run minecraft with optifine at around 50fps on average with a beefy texture pack. Upgradability: the laptop is equipped with 8gb of ram soldered to the board and an 8gb stick of ddr4 ram. Acer has confirmed that this motherboard can utilize 24gb if you were to swap that 8gb stick for a 16gb. The NVME drive is relatively easy to access and swap out for a 1tb if you so wish. Theoretically you could also try adding a 2.5in drive as there is an empty bay for it. If you were to do that you would need to acquire a ribbon cable connector. I have tried one from an SP315 model with no success, but that may be due to a defective wire. I currently have ordered a cable from an SP314 model to see if i have any luck with that. I will update if im successful. I got my system on prime day for $100 off, but even at its full $800 price tag this system is tempting. You wont find all these features on another laptop at this price point. The closest thing i could find was an ultrathin at the same price by acer, but it had only 8gb of ram and no touchscreen and pen support. I would recommend this pc for your average user. Pretty much anyone that doesnt intend to do any heavy gaming or professional color focused work.","Generally the laptop is good. In price-to-performance and characterstics criteria I found it best. Runs fast, no lags. I would give 5 stars if not the following issues: - The most annoying is that enter key stucks sometimes, and comes out in 1-2 seconds or doesn't come out. I hope engineers will improve that in later versions. - Touch screen works well, but I expected it to be wider. As it can be observed from the photo it is not as wide near to bottom where \"acer\" is written. - Also battery life is written up to 12 hours. But in my case it not more that 8 hours.","I just got this laptop and I gotta say, It delivers. It is fast and runs my applications like PyCharm, Anaconda and Autodesk Inventor pretty well so far. The only issue I have so far is how loud the fan is. Especially when you're transitioning from a virtually noiseless laptop. Besides that, It is a great product and I recommend!","UPDATE: a few months in and I'm overall pretty happy with this laptop. A metal body would be nice (this one shows smudges and recently got a scratch although I'm not sure how since the lid was shut and the scratch was by the touchpad). I have yet to need it for anything particularly resource intensive but no issues using it for Word, PDFs, Internet, and the like. It's also not all that common that I hear it's fans go into overdrive and make a ruckus. I try to use a lap desk whenever I'm not at a desk but even when I don't, it hasn't gotten as hot as the first day when it was too hot to leave on my lap. In short, if my previous cons list had led me to only give 4 stars, I would bump it up to a 5 now, but it was a five-star purchase from the start. :) (Summary at the bottom) PROS: -This is a pretty reasonable deal when you compare to the cost of getting the same specs on other laptops. I was mainly looking at Dell and Lenovo and the best I found from them was Lenovo's 2019 Flex 6 14\". Biggest difference between the specs that mattered to me was the Lenovo only cost $750 but also only had an i5 processor. The specs that mattered to me were processor, hard drive capacity, SSD, screen resolution, size, weight, RAM, and that it was a 2-in-1. -I haven't used much more than Chrome, Adobe PDF reader and Excel yet so I haven't tried to max out computer resources but I can verify that there's no lag with normal use. Restart takes 20 seconds from hitting restart to being logged in with the fingerprint scanner. -3rd party reviews from sites like PCMag of the 2018 model complained about the keys not depressing far enough to be comfortable typing a lot. While a slightly longer keystroke would feel more satisfactory to me, it's not so shallow that I would avoid it for large quantities of writing. -FHD seems like a good resolution on a 14\" screen. HD is not considered high res these days but I doubt the improvement of a 4K screen would be worth the cost, if you could even notice a significant difference between the two screens. -My last laptop had a 15.6\" screen so it was a bit of a risk cutting down on screen space but 14\" doesn't feel cramped the way 11\" or even 13\" does. It doesn't feel small unless it's sitting right next to my old laptop. The weight savings of having a smaller laptop are definitely worth it! -It's got a plastic body but it doesn't feel flimsy or cheaply built for the most part. The few minor exceptions are in my Cons list. -Fingerprint scanner was a bonus for me. It works very nicely -Stylus is handy in tablet mode. I didn't buy the laptop for the stylus so I can't speak to it's quality but I was able to make some fun art messing around in Inkscape with it. I don't know how it would work for professional-level art since the limiting factor for me is that I'm still pretty new to Inkscape. CONS: -Doesn't have the 12-hour battery life they advertise but then again, what laptop ever has the full capacity advertised? I would guess it's actually around 6-8 hours, which is still pretty reasonable. Tip: look up Acer's recommendations for battery charging before you set it up. I know it's important to go through a few full charge cycles when you first get it to extend the battery life but I forget the details of their recommendation. -It does get hot and use the fans at full speed pretty easily. The vents are on the bottom of the laptop and along the hinged edge whereas my last laptop had them on the left edge so with this one, I can almost guarantee you'll want to set it on a lap desk or large book rather than directly on your lap if you're going to be using it for a longer sitting. I'll probably eventually get a lap desk with cooling fans built in. That said, there's only been a couple times the fans have gotten noisy when it wasn't on my lap and when I moved it off my lap after it got too hot to be comfortable, it cooled down very quickly. -The charging plug is surprising small - probably to help keep the laptop thin. I don't mind that but it still has a lot of wobble to it when it's plugged in so my preference is to unplug it again once the battery is fully charged. -Indoors with a room well-lit by ambient daylight, having the brightness at about 65% is comfortable for me. This doesn't leave a lot of buffer to amp it up outside in the sun but I'm not surprised that's not what laptops are designed for. -Same with the volume - max volume was comfortable if not a bit quiet outdoors but if I wanted to broadcast music outside, I'd use a portable speaker anyways. In the home, I haven't felt the need to max out the volume though. -There's a couple rubber feet and you can see some of the places the screen clips into the frame, which gives it a bit cheaper aesthetic but nothing major. I'll probably get used to it. -Bezel along the top and sides is reasonable but it's pretty thick along the bottom - probably 3\/4\" of visible case, which makes sense because of the hinges, but then another 1\"+ of glossy black before the screen actually starts. The only thing in that space, at least externally, is the Acer logo. The result is it makes the task bar look really far up. -Probably the thing I dislike the most is that the casing used for the 360 hinges has a see-your-reflection-in-it type of shiny surface. Maybe it's just personal taste but it makes them look like cheap plastic. It's also annoying when I'm in a room with low lighting and they catch the glare from a lamp behind me. SUMMARY: It has some quirks I don't care for but I bought it mainly for the processing power and portability. More money would probably fix the quirks but thanks to other reviews, I wasn't surprised by any of them.","I was surprised by the actual power this thing had. The touch screen is very responsive and the finger print reader doesnt miss a beat. This computer boots and logs in in less than 5 seconds with the finger print reader. The only complaint I have is that it feels a little flimsy so you will need to use it with a bit more caution. I will be looking for a hard case for transporting it to class. This thing should definitely do everything a college student will need it to. Update: About a month in and it's still pretty quick. It's slowed down maybe a little with some of the programs I've been adding and running. I have the drive set to defragment everyday so that helps. I am still pretty well happy with it. I do wish it were a little more sterdy. They plastic bows quite a bit and it makes me nervous transporting it as often as I do for college. Wish they made a hard shell case for this.","Liking this device so far.  Just recently received, but I needed more ram and processing power, and this laptop has not disappointed.  Where with 8GB in the past I was at 90+% of system resources, having the laptop bog down, this Acer Spin 3 is at 40ish% with all the same applications.  Little to no delay in app switching.  I notice a fan running often, but did not look into that much yet. The Spin part, the convertible, is a nice feature.  I like using tent or tabletop mode (keyboard facing down) and the touchscreen is pretty responsive with my finger or a stylus.  I actually like having the SD card reader instead of using a dongle.  Like the fingerprint reader that lives in the touchpad.  Interesting placement, but works well. Two things I would change--a USB C for either charging or adapters.  Also another USB C instead of the USB 3.0.  Luckily I got a good StarTech USB to HDMI adapter for my second monitor (don't install their software, it will eventually recognize!), but it would've been nice to save $50. Battery, especially when the screen is up to full brightness (nice, bright screen!) gets chewed through pretty quickly.  Not sure I've see the time expectations as advertised. Would I buy and recommend this laptop?  Absolutely.","Do not buy this computer... it has been one of my worse experiences with any laptop by various reasons. First of all, when they sent the computer and a letter of they keyboard didnt work. After concluding that it wouldnt get any better I called customer service for them to fix it. They responded warmly and willingly to help, nevertheless, after I sent it, it was returned with the charger missing! To this day I cant use the computer because I need to buy a new generic charger. The worse part was that they didnt fix the computer well! Now a part of the touchpad doesnt work correctly. Another thing to take into consideration is that the touchscreen is made out of a cheap material, therefore it bends with little effort. Overall it is a good computer, however in case it isnt delivered to you in perfect conditions, I would suggest you to ask for a refund, because if you send it for repair it may come back with the charger stolen or another part of the laptop malfunctioning.","Over the years I've owned a lot of computers, tablets and desk tops...they are a necessity for my job and must handle some fairly serious number crunching, hobbies like photography and HUGE files for books, articles and genetic data...among other things. In the past I've resorted to using one computer for professional work and one for personal but cheap computers are horrid things. I've bought a couple Acers in the past - chromebooks - basically to keep family out of my \"real\" computers. Frankly, that was what I was expecting again - another Acer that would be used for small family chats and other miscellaneous. I was pleasantly surprised to encounter a light weight, very versatile and downright peppy performance on this new model. First the good - out of the box this can be turned on and set-up. Cortana literally talks you through the process and it takes just a few minutes. Add a couple more for syncing with other accounts and you are done. The built in stylus is responsive and sensitive as is the touch screen capacity. The fingerprint security is terrific - works very well. This comes pre-loaded with some junk and games that I have no interest in so cannot comment on that but also has basic office software and the Microsoft\/Google Edge. Initially I had no intent on using it but curiosity got the best of me and once again, I was pleasantly surprised. While I'm not sure I'll continue to use Edge, it's worth checking out. Meanwhile I downloaded my normal browsers and set-up a few other features...transfer rates were excellent as were launch\/use. Everything is zippy - no major lag times encountered anywhere. The keyboard is comfortable but much to my surprise, this is so versatile that I found myself using the touch screen and voice instructions frequently. I absolutely love the ability to swap it around to type\/work on a paper then switch to tablet mode while reading. Normally I work with dual monitors and often have a laptop beside me but this felt natural and able to switch naturally. Resolution looks good whether reading or launching a movie - I spent some time playing around with various media files and again, fast uploads and downloads, good picture. The one complaint is the sound which isn't much to get excited about - it's audible but the quality leaves a bit to be desired. I\"m hoping this performs well over the long haul and would love to see a larger and faster model brought to market.","I bought this for Prime Day on Monday.  I received it on Wednesday. Fast shipping.  I was busy that day but I opened it on Thursday.  It was fast, it was accurate, and it did everything I needed.  I think I downloaded the twitch app and loaded word and excel on it.  I treated this thing like a baby.  On Sunday, I went to use it at my friends house. and I lift it and it starts to glitch like something out of the movies.  I think there was something loose in it and anytime I touch or lift near the bottom right part of the keyboard, it glitches like it and stops working.  I either get a blue screen or it just freezes.  I hope to get a replacement that works as great as it did the day i opened it. Note: There was no packing material in the shipping box too.  I don't know how UPS could have abused it before I even received it.","I bought a laptop Acer Spin 3 (Convertible Laptop, 14\" Full HD IPS Touch, 8th Gen Intel Core i7-8565U) when it was on sale (Photo 1). We found there was a gap on the left side between top and bottom, which was clearly seen by zooming in the photo. We returned it to exchange another one. Soon after we set up the second one (photo 2 for illustration), we heard a rattling and colliding sound of the fan when the laptop was lifted up with hands holding top-left and bottom-right corners. The same sound could be heard when the speaker was slightly pressed near \u201cSPIN\u201d with a finger or when an ear pressed against the cover (when closed). This is NOT the normal noise of the fan. It is a defect. The fan and\/or the parts it hits and even the whole computer could soon break. I requested a return and I selected \"Item Defective OR doesn't work\" as the reason for return (within a few days of delivery). The the seller charged me $139.80. According to the return policy for \"Computers and Electronics\" and listed reasons for return, have could charge the return of a DEFECTIVE computer (or any product)??!! (This is NOT the end of our complaint!)","The computer arrived broken. The touch screen works fine , but the keyboard does not work and the touch pad does not work. I called the tech service-I advice you don\u2019t call them and speak with amazon directly. The representative had poor English , asked me to update the display driver , then restart the computer which did not work. Then he asked me to restore the computer which further locked the screen rotation. I am a computer expert I have built many computers and I have repaired many laptops, but this tech support that they have is obviously not experienced nor are they well versed in reading diagnostic steps. The he recommended I call acer and get warranty replacement cause the item is defective, this will take month and I need the laptop before school starts next week. I advise you choose a different more reliable computer , most of these review I believe are bias. In addition the laptop is sitting on a desk, thus the fan and venting is very open , but the fan turns on so o obnoxiously loud. Very disappointing. If I could give it negative stars I would.","Amazon paid me a discount for missing digital pen. The seller did not pack it in with the laptop. Worse, Acer is not responsive. Putting that aside,  I still think this laptop has the best value (specs for the price point).  The worst thing I could say about this laptop (given its price point), is its stinginess with ports. I also wish it was a bit lighter but that probably would increase costs. I give it 1 star for not delivering on their promise (for the missing digital pen) and their customer service. Had it been not for that, I would rate this a 4 out of 5 (-1 for the ports).","I love Amazon...the Acer Spin3 I received did not type, the cursor disappeared etc. I called Amazon, they scheduled & sent replacement computer before I returned the product, due to the late hour. I received the replacement yesterday.  The screen clarity is amazing. It doesn't come with an instruction manual. NOT;, the fan is NOT loud as reviewed,, in fact, it's  quite. COMPLAINTS; very heavy;  the function keys are hard to decipher; it comes with Norton (which I dislike) & it won't uninstall, (I use Weboot Secure Anywhere). Apps it comes with are difficult to delete & I'm Microsft certfied. DO NOT BELIEVE reviewers saying the opposite. So far so good; except for Norton uninstall.","This londistance high performance machine, paired with above average tuned devices, incorporates subtle running eficient execution, at the optimum equation! Below i note the Pro's\/Con's with the easy upgrade ++ suggestions to perform at Zenith proportions. For such a low cost and meek computation presentation. Here, this deception, is not a negative value, to those who demand coherant processing in a concurrant altruism.

Lighted keyboard could apply adjustable RGB standards to induce sectional colored key mapping. Screen uses a large bezel instead, could add 25% more screen to employ a higher real state viewing area.","So I just bought this Acer laptop after careful consideration and it does perform superbly. All the features are as describe except for one, which is the only reason I am giving this item a 4 star. BATTERY LIFE....The item is listed as lasting for 12 hrs. And even after a full charge while on energy saver, it says it will only last 8.5 hours. I'm very big on details when purchasing anything. So if it says 12 hrs it should indeed last 12 hrs. Now for everyone else that reviewed saying the laptop was loud or they heard the fan. I have yet to have any issues of the sort like that with this laptop. Its fast, silent, touch screen is phenomenal, screen resolution is great and works great with multiple tasks.","The touch screen and stylist work great. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of artwork with it and have had no troubles. The flippable screen is wonderful, slides super smoothly. Love watching movies on it and does well for my college courses. However, I\u2019ve only had the device since September and have issues. One, it\u2019s already running a bit slow at times, though boot up isn\u2019t bad. Two, for some reason the screen is screwed up. Sometimes, the screen won\u2019t light up, but the keypad will. The screen sometimes flickers, fades out to black, or has streaks of black out of no where. And when these issues happen the screen completely stops working. I tried restarting the computer and troubling shooting and nothing really fixed it. Once or twice shaking it lightly fixed it. Three, the battery only lasts for 6-7 hours. The charger I got had trouble staying in so I bought another one. Still the same battery life, even when I made changes to battery usage. Overall it\u2019s actually really good when it\u2019s not having issues. But I\u2019ve only had it around 2-3 months and it\u2019s having issues.","TL;DR-  This 2-in-1 laptop is packed with fantastic specs including an i7 processor, 16gb of ram, and a 512 gb Solid State Drive.  It is fast and the touch screen is great.  The negatives:  battery life is about 6 hours and the fingerprint reader has not worked for me since day 3. I really do like this Acer Spin 3 2-in-1 laptop.  The combination of the 8th generation i7 processor, 16gb of ram and the 512 Solid State Drive make this machine very fast and I have yet to bog it down.  It is a lot faster than my desktop computer, which is about 2 years old and has 12 gb of ram and a standard 1tb hard drive.  The integrated graphics card is basic and would not be useful for a person that does a lot of video editing or hardcore gaming, neither of which I do.  The backlit keyboard works well. The 14 inch screen is exactly what I was looking for because a 15.6 would be to big for me to carry around daily and a 13.3 seemed a touch small.  I have watched many videos on the 1080p HD screen and it looks great, but then again it is only 14 inches so even 720p or possibly 480p would look good on this size.  The touch screen works great, I have had zero issues with it. The laptop has all of the connections I require, but it would have been nice if it had a USB-C.  When I purchased the laptop I knew it did not have a USB-C, so I fine with that.  The other outstanding specs in this machine were more important to me. Regarding battery life, so far the best I have really done is about 6 hours or half of which the manufacture claimed.  Unfortunately, half the battery life is par for the course when it comes to laptops.  Also the thumb print reader only worked for a few days even though I cleaned it.  Luckily I have been able to login with my PIN, but one day I did have an issue that said my PIN was not valid.  A restart of the computer appeared to fix that issue. All-in-all it is a nice laptop that performs well.  I want to rate it 5 stars, but due to the thumb print reader and battery life I am giving it 4 stars.  I would purchase this 2-in-1 again.  Price to specs is very good.","I LOOOOOVE this computer. The resolution is even better of what I was expecting and the speakers are great. I used from about 3 pm till 2 am on and off (mostly on lol) before I had to plug it in. The Active stylus is AMAZING. I am a college student so I was looking for a device on which I could take notes too and this is just the perfect choice. If you watch the video you can see I wasn't able to get it out but I finally made it at the end :D. Literally everything is amazing. Although I gave it four stars instead of five because there's no instruction guide. In the box there was only a two page setup guide that just tells you what to do when you turn it on the first time and not much else. So you mostly have to figure it out by yourself unless you want to call the costumer service number (flyer included in the box) but I like figuring out things by myself mostly. The hardest thing was figuring out how to use the different functionalities of the active stylus mainly, all the other functionalities are well explained when you turn on the computer for the first time. But overall I am super happy with my purchase.","This computer is great with great features (I7, 512GB and 16GB DDR4) but a quite reasonable price. One of the lowest in the market. I bought it for photo editing. The screen looks great even with online concerns of low brightness. It is more than enough for the indoor use.  Have not yet tested the outdoor use. The pen is great for kids drawing.  The key board and touchpad is working as expected. Even the material is not metal, the feel of the laptop is great with glossing casing from plastics. The speakers are nice for general youtubes. There are some cons for the laptop. First,  the screen is not as sturdy and it could easily get itself down when you walk with the computer. I expect the problem could get worse through time. Second, the fan noise is louder than a general ultrabook, but could result from the high cpu speed of this computer. However, for general light work such as MS Word, Youtube, and Chrome, the computer stays quiet. You should update the BIOS driver from July to mitigate this issue. Third, if you want to use the external 4K monitor, the HDMI is version 1.4 not 2.0. Thus you have only 30HZ refreshing rate, which is quite slow. There no display or usb c type port to resolve this. In summary, this laptop has great features, a budget price and fantatistic verserbility. Its pros are much more than cons and thus I gave 4.5 stars.","I\u2019ve been using my new Spin for about a month, and I\u2019m delighted with it. My demands aren\u2019t terribly heavy \u2014 no serious gaming or rendering, just light CAD and software development alongside the usual browsing and Internet usage \u2014 and this machine fits the bill nicely. I haven\u2019t used Windows machines much at all for many years, but I wanted to try Windows 10 and the 2-in-1 form factor, so non-touch laptops were out. Cheaper 2-in-1\u2019s are surely available, but the i7 CPU, good-sized SSD, and 16GB of RAM, along with good experiences I\u2019ve had with Acer machines in the past, led me to this machine. I\u2019ve found it really pleasant to use and have found myself picking it up often for casual use. With Windows 10, it switches effortlessly between laptop and tablet modes, handling both portrait and landscape mode automatically. I didn\u2019t know how well direct screen touch would work with Windows apps, since most of them were designed with a mouse in mind, but modern apps like Microsoft News work nicely with big fingers. I also appreciate the fact that the system didn\u2019t come with a lot of extra junk apps installed. Although I\u2019m not a gamer, I have fond memories of the Mechwarrior series of games, so I installed Mechwarrior Online on the Spin. It was playable, but a little sluggish; I think I\u2019d get frustrated with its responsiveness in a pitched battle. Older games seem to work pretty well, so if you want to revisit some classics from GOG.com, for example, the Spin will serve well. The only nits I\u2019d pick are the lack of a thumb relief notch to make opening the lid easier and the fact that the machine\u2019s a bit heavy for tablet-style browsing. The fingerprint reader requires more than one try pretty often, and of course, one could always use more battery life. But I\u2019m really pleased with this machine, and although my MacBook Pro is still my primary device, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend the Spin to anyone with similar needs\u2026 it\u2019s a great value.","The laptop arrived yesterday, and setting up was easy. Far easier than the 17 inch Dell Inspiron I got a month ago. Love the smaller size, too. The keyboard has a nice little bounce to it. Love the feel of it when I type  The screen is fantastic, and the touch feature is responsive. The sound is better than most laptops I had over the years. I will pair it with a wireless speakers. Streamed movies from Netflix and Amazon Prime without problem. Generally, I love the set up, the ease which I can get started and working on the laptop (I think it took only 15 mins). And it played my fav game (Civ 6) with ease. Nice laptop!","I have been using this laptop for a month. First, the laptop arrived in excellent conditions. No scratches, no missing parts. It boots up very quickly, indeed. After turning it on for the first time, it required me to provide few information and, after about five minutes it was fully configured. Then, I updated the base language to my native language, which took another twenty minutes or so. After that, I have been using it without problems, except a few snags. I will explain it below. 1- Screen and touchscreen \u2013The screen is bright, clear, swiftly responsive upon touch and accurate. The rim around the screen is very thin, making it looks like the screen occupies the whole facing plate. Tablet mode switch window automatically pops-up when the screen is flipped over. The screen plate hinge built is sturdy. It seems to me it will be able to do the job flipping over and over for a long time. Pen is also accurate (Added on 11\/20\/2019 - I mean, fairly accurate. A small four points star reflects the contact point of the pen when it touches the screen exactly underneath. However, if you lift up the pen tip from the screen, just a few millimeters, and moves the pen around without contact, you will notice that the star indicating the pen tip position underneath falls behind and takes a while to update the exact position.) 2 - Core i7 CPU, 16 Gb RAM, 512 Gb SSD set - Very nice. CPU-Z version 1.89.1x64 rates the CPU as 1605.1 for multi thread and 358.8 for single thread. (multithread ratio 4.47), running Norton antivirus, MS OneDrive and MS Defender in background. Number of USB ports (2.0 and 3.1, type A one of each) is Ok for me. There is one HDMI 1.4b port and one SD card reader port. Double antenna ac WiFi, Bluetooth. 3 - Battery life - Using factory settings, it will certainly last between 4 h and 6 h. Adjusting battery settings to economy mode, Intel Graphics Control Panel to maximum battery autonomy, dimming screen brightness to minimum, turning off both Bluetooth and location (GPS) facility, and keeping the keyboard backlight on, battery will probably last between 10 h and 12 h (Battery gauge indicates remaining charge for 10 h at 94 %). When using it continuously for text writing and internet surfing, it will probably last up to 8 h. Turning keyboard backlight off will make it last a little longer, perhaps. 4 - Keyboard \u2013 This is the reason I gave it 4 stars (and stated almost flawlessly, above). I would have given 4.5 if it would be possible. The keyboard is backlit, which is very good. It dims off automatically a few seconds after the last hit, and turns light on as one types. It can also be permanently turned off, if necessary. Fingerprint sensor works Ok and activates the laptop swiftly. I had to relearn the positions of arrows, page up\/down. In addition, home\/end functions are only accessible via pressing simultaneously Fn & pgup\/pgdn, which has been tricky since I started using it. The point is that the experience offered by Spin 3 keyboard typing makes me feel like the keys are not exactly loose, but not so tight either. Sometimes, it duplicates the character when I press the key once, like 'nn', 'aa', 'rr', 'ee', and 'oo'. As I type quickly, now and then I must come back, erase the character typed in double, and retype the word again (as I am doing it right now). (Added on 11\/17\/2019 - In my opinion, the problem escalates here when I type a password to enter an account. This double typing glitch may cause unwillingly [as it really does few times] password errors. In a plausible scenario where you are about to register an website account and enter the password for the first time, if a mistyping happens then, you will have to rescue your password ahead, at least.) I think this a chronic problem. This is my second ACER laptop. The first one, Aspire V5 touchscreen core i5, I bought it five years ago is overall working fine, by the way (Refer to a review I have made of Acer Aspire V5). The issue is that key pressing results in double tying in Aspire V5 as it does in Spin 3. However, Spin 3 typing experience has improved in relation to Aspire V5. Mouse-pad is Ok and fingerprint sensor works fine. Overall, I am glad about my acquisition, and I think this has been an excellent laptop for the price. Keyboard needs to improve. Peace and blessings.","Okay okay okay.. I just bought this yesterday and got it today. It was one day shipping woo! I bought this laptop to be able to play games, do my homework and just browse. I do own an Xbox one so this laptop isn't 100% for gaming just FYI. I am super shocked out how amazing this laptop is! It is a tiny bit smaller than my Acer Chromebook and way lighter\/thinner. The back light on the keyboard is an awesome feature too. It stays on while typing which is nice. The touch screen is fantastic! I used the stylus that comes with the computer (Thank you for adding a stylus with this laptop!!) and I had no issues tapping and scrolling. It does bend backwards to can use it in tablet mode. Battery life is great as well. No complaints so far. It came with a fully charged battery which was awesome too. Now for my GAMERS out there! I play Roblox (don't judge me lol) and I wanted to see how this computer will run a game that I like to play on my Xbox. This game has a LOT of stuff to load and it loaded everything very fast! The graphics are superb and I was able to plug in my Xbox one controller with no issue as well. I haven't tried playing like any heavy duty games like COD. I don't play that Fortnite mess, so don't ask lol. I do not plan on putting any major games on since again I have an Xbox which has my COD games and other stuff. The speaker is loud, but not loud as a desktop. I'll say it is louder than my Chromebook. I put in a 5 second video of one of my favorite kpop songs lol. Oh, it hasn't gotten hot either so it's okay to place on your lap. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me! :) Update: This laptop does get hot. I had this sitting on my bed while playing on it and when I lifted it up, it was very hot. I recommend keeping this on cool hard or wooded surfaces. :)","I thought the laptop on prime day and it crapped out on me 2 days later. It was working great and then all of a sudden the screen turned black and I couldnt restart it or reboot or anything. For the 2 days I had the laptop it seemed good. It was a little heavier than I expected and the fan was a little loud but decent speed.","For the price of this computer, the laptop is amazing. It has high specifications for processing power, easy to use, and very affordable. This is the reason I purchased it and it has failed me. I've had it for over a month now and I'm very satisfied. I spent a long time researching laptops and this is absolutely the best deal out there. It's kind of a secret too.","I honestly think this laptop is the best deal for its spec. I read review about the bad screen and I have to agree. However since I use this laptop for coding with external monitor, this is not my biggest concern. Its still get a four stars for its performance. I wish they put the fan on the edge laptop instead of the bottom. Using the laptop on your lap is not the most comfortable experience.","I bought the laptop for college because I wanted something that was cheaper than a macbook but would also last for a while. Overall the computer feels responsive and of durable build quality. This feels like it'll last all through college for my purposes. The touch screen works well; the stylus charges while stored inside the laptop and features a right click button by the thumb. Very useful for while in tablet tablet mode but a finger works just fine on the touchscreen as well. Not terrible for gaming but also not great. Powerful cpu but no graphics card means that any game that's graphics intensive wont run well, but in fullscreen most cpu intensive games will run at 60fps just fine. Definitely meant for notetaking and watching videos instead of gaming. Speakers sound good, visually the screen looks how you'd expect a 1080p screen to look, the fingerprint scanner works consistently, bluetooth works with my logitech mouse and detected several other devices,  and the keyboard is backlit. The keyboard is a bit shallow (similar to how a macbook feels to type on) so typing might feel weird to some. The touch pad feels kind of glossy, but I'll be using my mouse 90% of the time so that doesn't matter to me much. The hinge is very stable but that does make the lid a little difficult to open. Overall pretty satisfied with my purchase, would recommend.","This is a GREAT laptop but it has a few faults. First things first, the touch screen works great. Super responsive. Same with the stylus. The only thing I don\u2019t like about the stylus is...it\u2019s a little small. Someone with big hands might find it hard to work with. But other than that, it\u2019s good. The 14 inch screen is a good size. I don't feel like it needs to be any bigger or smaller, just right. The fingerprint reader works like a charm. Sometimes it will have trouble picking up your fingerprint, but with some slight readjustments it works fine. The mousepad is great and I\u2019ve encountered no problems with it thus far. I\u2019ve had this laptop for several months and these are my TWO BIGGEST GRIPES. One: the battery life. I bought this laptop for school and the biggest thing that stands out is the BATTERY LIFE. DO NOT LISTEN to what Acer or Amazon says. This laptop does NOT get 12 hours of battery life. If that is a big deal for you, then please look for another laptop. I would say it can get 6-8 hours of battery life, 8 if you\u2019re pretty lucky. Now please note I have never run a battery test on this laptop, this is just coming from my personal experience. IF you\u2019re buying this laptop for school, then I wouldn\u2019t worry about. I have never had to use this for more than a couple hours at a time, so, personally, I don\u2019t think the battery life is too bad. My SECOND gripe is...it feels cheap. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the specs for this laptop at this price range are insane (btw, please don\u2019t expect to do hardcore gaming on this, it will drain the battery, look elsewhere if you want a gaming laptop), but it just...feels cheap. It\u2019s made of this cheap-feeling plastic (excluding the screen of course), which makes it feel like it will get completely destroyed after one drop on hard concrete. Now, notice I said cheap-FEELING. I have no clue what this thing can with stand or what it\u2019s made of, I\u2019m just telling you that, in my opinion, it feels cheap. However other than these two complaints, everything feels great. It super quick and snappy and have encountered very little problems with it. It spins around and works just fine when putting it into tablet mode, (though I don\u2019t use this mode that often myself). Keyboard is good, love the backlighting. Not too loud, and I don\u2019t feel that it gets that hot, (but I haven\u2019t been doing intense stuff with it at the same time). Again, idk what suits you personally but for me, the ports are fine. All I find myself using is the USB, HDMI, headphone jack, and charging port (obviously). I don\u2019t feel that it takes that long to charge, maybe a couple hours. Before I wrap this up, one final (small) gripe I have to talk about is the speaker. I\u2019m not a tech-savvy person (as you probably noticed) so I couldn\u2019t tell you what exactly is wrong with the speaker. It just feels...mediocre. It\u2019s not the worst I\u2019ve ever heard but it\u2019s nowhere close to being the best. It\u2019s just...ok. Certainly not a deal breaker for this laptop though. In conclusion, this is an AMAZING laptop for its price with a few issues (battery life, plastic, speaker), but honestly, every laptop has its problems. With the Acer Spin 3, the good DEFINITELY outweighs the bad for this laptop. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great, reasonably priced laptop.","The display is gorgeous. Setup was a snap. I could wish for volume controls while in tablet mode, but that's the only lack I see so far. It's only been a day, but I'm finding lots to like about this device. So far, I haven't encountered issues with heat or fan noise others have mentioned. In fact it is as silent as, and cooler than my Surface Pro3. The only issue was that the bundle was missing the active stylus. Amazon was unable to help, but Acer quickly arranged to send me one.  I'll update if I encounter anything a buyer should know, but I'm a happy camper, right now.","This Laptop is a one and done for me as a law student. When I got accepted to the university of London. One of the first things I was told I needed was a laptop. Not just any PC; but a laptop. So immediately I was looking for something that's easy to move around with because of my busy life and also that has a stylus for running thru PDFs on Microsoft edge and highlighting as I go through tons of cases. This PC proves to be excellent. I will say it is NOT A LIGHT WEIGHT PC. At about 4lbs you can definitely tell when it's in hand. But I would brush that off when I consider I Got a pc with the specs of the latest flagship of other companies for 600USD less. I don't need a thunderbolt. So I didn't see the need to spend the extra 100USD to have it and the present usb 3.1 port fast charges my phone.  A plus for me. Also the screen is remnant of a 2014 flagship.  It's better than my iPad mini 1. But shows significantly less radience\/saturation in colors than on my Samsung Galaxy Note 9.  It's somewhere in the middle. As it's for school and not graphic design I'm not bothered. I'd advise that if u have to use it for precise editing that you connect it to an external monitor as it does have the POWER needed for most intermediate work and an external screen won't cost much. I think Acer built this pc with what is needed for professionals and students alike and as such. There is no competition when considering \"bang for buck\".  My disclaimer is. Know why you are buying this pc and it will be perfect. As I stated. I am a student. And as such. It gets the job done and then some. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udfff \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udfff. Thank you Acer. I hope it stands the text of time.  First time Acer user.","This laptop is serving me very well.  For it's price, it has 16 GB of RAM and a 512 GB SSD.  It has a respectable CPU but only an iGPU.  This means that the laptop is very good for typical use, but it cannot play games well.  If gaming isn't a concern for you, this laptop is great. The screen looks very good and the stylus works fairly well. The build quality is ok.  It is a plastic chassis which makes it light but it doesn't feel premium.  The hinge feels pretty robust. While the keyboard feel good, the trackpad doesn't feel the best.  It seems to be pretty small and clicking it doesn't feel that good.  There is some wiggle room especially at the bottom of the touchpad. Another downside is the limited ports.  It only has 2 USB 3.0 ports.  I would have prefered at least 3 ports with one preferably being a USB C.  It seems kind of a waste when you can see how much unutilized space there is for putting more ports. Lastly, the speakers a pretty quite and a bit tinny. If you are looking for a budget performance laptop at the cost of some non-essential functionality and performance, this is a good laptop.","It's only a couple of months old, and already starting to have problems with the keyboard. The touch screen is annoying, because the way it folds up, the keyboard is on the back of the screen and it is weird to use as a tablet. I bought it to draw on, thinking I would use PS and the pen, but the pen on this machine is a flimsy ball of crap. Not amazing. Windows system, is, of course as always annoying. Comp comes with one month trials of a lot of useless software so you have to spend a lot of time uninstalling that and installing something that will actually work. Overall, just not amazing, but functional.","Excellent product. Will keep you updated.","Finally, I enjoy the use of a laptop.  Very high quality build.  Stylish and powerful.  The screen and backlit keyboard is just out of competition.  I put five.  The price is better than others, given the cool stuffing - the newest processor, 16 gb of memory and 512 gb SSD.  Monster.  Rocket.  Beautiful horse for those who love to drive fast.  Very fast.  The charging pen is eternal, no need to change tips.  The pen has very soft pressure and writing text. The Acer pen is very good, similar to the perfect Apple pen. Do not believe some reviews that the battery is weaker than described.  It may well withstand all 12 hours.  It depends on what to do with this computer.","The laptop is very fast, and the hard drive is fine for my use.  Have had for two months, and only negative comment is the battery life.  It last for about five hours, and not the 11 hours in the ads.  Battery life has not been a problem yet, but may be on an overseas flight. The light weight and the tenting angles are very good for travel.  The sound is good for a reasonably priced laptop, as I often play music in the background using my ear buds.","I'll start with the bad. The wifi chip included on the laptop I received was not comparable with my wifi provider. After 1-10 minutes of use of the laptop my modem and my router would \"crash\" and turn off. Therefore having all of my household devices disconnected from the wifi for about 2 minutes while my modem and router turn back on. I've never had this problem happen before until I bought this laptop. The issue happened right out of the box. I checked for updates and went through their IT support for about 5 times doing various things, but they couldn't fix it. At the end they told me to call my wifi provider and ask if it was comparable, I've never heard of this issue before so I decided to return the product. For the good. It was an amazing laptop other than the wifi issue. I thought it was amazing as of what you get for this price. It took like 2-4 seconds to turn on from shut down, and everything else seemed to have worked fine. The only downside I had was the graphics card, but it wasn't a problem since it isn't a gaming laptop. I would have rated 5 stars if I han not spent about a whole week of constant wifi problems that impacted my home security with ring.","Awesome speed and can handle multitasking very well. I never have a delay. I love the backlight on the keyboard. Its kind of heavy to use in tablet mode but i guess thats the trade off for a larger screen. I love using the built in stylus pen to edit photos on photoshop and lightroom. Still not sure what the buttons on the stylus are for. Im glad it has a full sd card reader to transfer my photos. There are alot of 2 in 1 laptops out there. If you pick this one you wont be disappointed.","This computer has a wonderful processor and boots very quickly and I have not had any problems there.  What I don't like about this machine is the location of the heat exchange.  I cannot sit with it on my lap for long as it gets so hot it burns. I love the convertible aspect of this machine. Unfortunately the hinges are poor. The screen doesn't move when it is sitting still but if I move the machine around the screen flops down and does not hold it's position.  This is a disappointment after my hp which had fabulous hinges that only moved if you moved them.  Overall it is a pretty decent machine with a great processor and plenty of RAM.","Was excited to order the laptop after reading all these good reviews but it ended up in a disappointment. First off, the shipping done by Amazon was not all that great. There wasn\u2019t even done bubble wrap or air packets to safeguard the package. Coming to the laptop, first impressions were good. I opened the laptop screen and voila. Three big issues, 1) The laptop display panel was coming out from the laptop lid so much so that the backlight and everything was visible (see attached image for reference). 2) One of the display hinges (right hand side) had already gone kaput. It\u2019s alignment was off and the display was swinging back and forth without any adjustment being done. 3) The touch pad was a nightmare. Not sure if it was just my laptop or if it\u2019s the same with all Acer Spin 3s - the touchpad kept getting depressed for every touch when in reality it should actually get depressed that much only while clicking. The fact that the touchpad surface wasn\u2019t all that great by itself wasn\u2019t helping matters. The whole laptop (construction and quality of a materials used) felt a little cheap and plasticky. Didn\u2019t read this on any other reviews so I thought I\u2019d mention this - the power button is placed very weirdly on the left side of the laptop towards the front. Quite an odd position and not very comfy either to use. PROS - I used the laptop for a couple hours and the battery life seems to be good. Did some heavy browsing and a little bit of spreadsheet work and the little thing did not have any trouble handling the workload. In the end, I ended up returning the laptop. On the lookout for something better now.","This laptop is more than powerful enough to run the Adobe software I have tried so far which was Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere. I have had this laptop for over a month now and it has been very useful and I haven't really had a problem with it. Everything works great for what I need it for but that can vary for each person. I have had good experience with performance, the fingerprint scanner, touch screen, etc. The one thing I wish they would add is a few pads or something around the keyboard for when you have the keyboard face down on a desk or table. I love how you can fold it up backwards but the area around the keyboard scratches easy. If you do buy this product it would be a good idea to set the laptop on something soft if you plan on using it keyboard down. The battery life doesn't last 12 hours as they say but that goes for a lot of things you buy. I have had a good battery experience and it does not lack in this area. I can't really say how long the battery lasts because it depends on what you are doing. If you are browsing the internet then it should last a while but if you are running a more powerful program then it will go down faster. Overall, this laptop has proved its worth so far. If you are thinking about getting a laptop I would highly recommend this one. I am rating this 4\/5 stars because of how easy it is to scratch and how the battery doesn't last 12 full hours on a regular use (it still lasts long, just not as long as they say without turning on battery saver, having the brightness down, etc.)","I like the weight, price and functionality of the laptop but when they said it was loud, I didn't think it was LOUD. It sounds like the computer's about to take off when you have more than 5 browsers (simple web searches) open at the same time.","I got this laptop for my daughter who is entering college as a biology major. We looked at a couple different laptops and after a lot of research decided on this one. She loved the stylus (rechargeable) that it came with and also liked the fact that it was so flexible. For her major she needed something she could take notes in but she also preferred a laptop over a tablet so we knew this was a good choice. In terms of battery it was around 8-9 hours even though it was advertised around 12 but she found it workable. The graphics were good but the audio was a little weird. She also found it somewhat bulky for a college student to be carrying around but overall we would buy this again.","After I figured where to turn it on it was easy to set up.  The only thing I am disappointed with is the plug differs from my other Asis computers.  There is a slot to hold the pen which I found while trying to find the switch.  I like the touch of the Asis, and it appears to be well made.  After  using it a few days I ordered another one so I could have one at the office and another at home.  This one was easier to set up since I was familiar with it.  Bye Bye HP and Dell.","Good general use computer. A bit cheaper than the other options. The battery life is slightly above average. The computer and charger are fairly compact so it's easy to move around, but not as slim as most o the fancier competitors. Track pad is decent and hasn't caused me any problems. The keyboard feels a bit small for my hands (I'm 5'11 male) and is on the smaller end even for a laptop this size so I wish I had gone for a laptop with a larger keyboard. The touch screen works fine for quick note-taking or browsing in tablet mode and the stylus is appreciated, but it is not sensitive enough for professional or artistic purposes. Overall, would recommend with qualfications.","I just got this a few hours ago, and I\u2019ll add to this review as time goes on, but in the interim all I can say is, \u201cWow!\u201d  I got this so I can process photos when I travel, and it took to Photoshop like it was born to it. The keyboard feels great. It seems to run cool. I love the way it can turn into a tablet. I have a lot of software yet to install and will add to this review as I do, but so far I\u2019m impressed.","This is my first Acer product and I am very impressed. I have been buying HP for years and decided to try a different brand. I am very impressed. This computer is fast, it loads up in seconds and the performance is outstanding. I love the touch screen and how fats this computer is, it's much better than an HP.","Great for the price. Been using for about a month now. Pros: Very fast. Looks great Great for multitasking Cons: The outside is plastic, not a major issue but I'm used to a metal case and this just seems a bit scary. We'll see how it holds up with scratches and what not. Screen can be a bit shaking in some positions.","If this worked perfectly... (minus the dead pixels), It actually is a very cool laptop. I didn't get a refund and opted for the replacement to give it another go. Hopefully I'll have better luck next time because I legitimately really liked it.","The smaller footprint is probably better for  its weakest feature, ie the power connection. I bought this model again because of its reliability, although the skimpy power input port eventually completely failed. I will be much more vigilant with this one, unhooking it every time I pick it up, and sequestering the cord while it is plugged in.","The first reaction when I opened this laptop was...WOW. look wise it's simply fantastic. It takes some time to set up the windows and other things, but once it's done, then there nothing stopping this machine. The display quality is very good. Keypad has a very decent feel and backlit feature works perfectly in dark. Since it is a 2 in 1 machine, when converted to tablet mode, fits perfectly in your arms and the touch works nicely. Although you might feel a slight lag rarely, but that's okay. You didn't even realize. One thing that could be improved is the sound quality, it's too low. But for my purpose, this feature really doesn't matter. So overall a wonderful product and must buy if you are looking for a laptop in this budget range and ofcourse similar configuration. Thanks Acer!","For my first laptop, I made the mistake of buying one that was bulky, heavy, and very slow. I am a college student, and all I wanted was something that I can take in my bag and not feel drained at the end of the day, and this laptop hits all the points! It is so much faster than my previous laptop, very user friendly, and the touch screen is very good. My only complain is because it is not as sturdy as my previous laptop, I need to be more careful in handling it around, but besides that, I recommend!","Bought this laptop during Amazon Prime Day, so just got a solid deal on it. For the price I bought it at it was a good deal, i7 processor, 12 GB of RAM, with SSD in a 2-in-1 format. Performing well so far, at the end of the day it is still a laptop so it will heat up pretty good under load. It does everything I need it to do well. Definitely not a gaming laptop or anything of that nature. Overall please with my purchase for now and hope this laptop lasts me a while.","I will be going to college soon and the specs on this computer seemed too perfect to be true for its price point. I am glad I was wrong. This computer is snappy, portable, and is more than capable for data storage and transfers at blazing speeds. Overall, this laptop has a very good \"core\" component (Its more than capable as a laptop and performs above average). However, there are a few features that could improve, such as the fan noise being relatively loud or the battery life which is barely 7 hours for average use, a far cry from its advertised 12 hours. The laptop can get a bit hot as well. Ultimately, I am very happy with this purchase as I got it on Amazon Prime day. So, knowing it is cheap for its specs, the compromises are to be expected.","ultra response time in all activities.  unsure of not having a Ethernet port.  but gosh, whatevr you guys did, this machine is amazing.  we replaced my wife's Toshiba Satellite and her Lenova Ideapad.  way out dated. if i were rich, i would give one to everyone, lol. beautiful, Acer, just beautiful SJ","The good: Screen quality & resolution, touch screen, finger print sensor (works perfectly for me), back lit keyboard. Ofcourse, the SSD and 16GB RAM. The bad: Power button position is on the side. If you have any pen or something in the backpack and you put this laptop, the power button can get pressed. Since there is no special number keypad, some alphabet keys are re-used as number keys but they work only when Num lock is on. But there is no indication whether the Num lock is on or not. It is always trial and error, if you see numbers  getting printed then you have to press the Num lock one more time. The audio can be a little louder. The max volume is not that loud.","Bought this for my niece for beginning college. She loves it! She did the research and made the decision for this laptop; has no complaints.","I really like the size to start off with, not too big bot too small. Graphics are pretty good and mostly that RAM and Octacore processor with that amount of ssd for just over $800 is a steal. Spen works really well. Battery doesn't last 12 hours as said but it is decent for work. For designers this is a recommendation. Plus they give you norton antivirus and internet security built in. I would recommend this to everyone.","Set up started easy.  Was working on other things, came back to black screen.  Assumes sleep mode, no touch or keys brought it back.  Tech support trouble shooting didn't work.  Have to send in for repair.  Not a good start.  Will update after I get it back.","This laptop is a very good value product, runs as fast as flash. the noise issue mentioned by other users is actually not that loud, within acceptable range. I like this laptop and will recommend to my friends.","Got it could not connect to internet \u2639\ufe0f However, Acer has top notch customer service so they helped identify problem in which was our modem.. Contacted our internet provider and just under 2 hours I was connected. Love the quality and great customer service!!\ud83d\ude00","I needed a computer for my studies at college. But i didn't want just any cheap laptop, i wanted one that had good specs and a nice feeling to it. After browsing Amazon for a while, this one caught my eye. After receiving it, i was worried there would be some things that would disappoint me (as i think we all do when buying new things). But i was wrong. All the features that comes with it such as the fingerprint-log in, the bendable and touch screen and not to mention the battery time. Amazing. I really recommend this laptop for people that don't want to spend to much, and only needs a good overall computer.","I picked this computer up on amazon prime day(s).  Incredible specs for a very reasonable price.  The paperwork that came with the unit is sparce but the system walked me through the setup with ease.  I'm very please with the speed and overall utility of this pc.  Bravo Acer!","Instant on, instant off. Very fast. Wifi seems faster than my hard wired connections. Fast processor, right amount of ram (16 GB), good sized SSD (512 GB). By comparison, the 256\/8 GB computers seem unnecessarily hobbled. Prime day price was the icing on the cake.","I like everything about this laptop except the screen is highly reflective.  I just ordered an anti-glare screen protector that I hope will make it more comfortable and less distracting.  It is super fast and the battery lasts a long time.","Mostly I love the boot up speed with the ssd drive! I have yet to exhaust the battery in a day's work, and I enjoy being able to change it into tablet or tent mode! I like the fingerprint reader! Very happy with purchase.","This laptop is sleek, fast and offers so many features, including a touchscreen. It comes with a sleek pen and a small charging cord. Awesome that nothing is bulky! And my favorite part is that the keyboard lights up!","I just received the laptop an it didn't came with Active Rechargeable Stylus. And the the Tab key is hard to press, it seems will have problems in some time.","I had to replace my old Acer after about 6 years and I found this one to be a decent price and works well. Touch screen responds well, the voice recognition is very good and I also found the speakers worked very well compared to my last Acer. The battery life does hold a charge for about 5 hours but it is still a good computer. Very happy with my purchase.","Hi I bought this laptop in august 19 but now it has dead pixel and I used it very carefully what should I do now I turned back to my country (Turkey) at that time how can we fix this problem?","I'm not a computer expert, but for every day use standard computer usage it's been really great. Lightweight, fast, and I really like the finger print pass code. The tablet mode maybe doesn't work so well, but still nice to have the option to completely fold it over and work with it in your hands even if the setting seems to have an awkward screen arrangement; which can be difficult to use.","Great Laptop, not meant for gaming but can run some casual games like league of legends. The stylus that comes with it will work for some software but not all of it like adobe dc xi. It can get a bit nosy with the fan, but if you update the bios from the acer website it's not much of an issue. I like the feel of the keyboard, there's some click and weight but not enough to be super loud. Only 2 USB slots which is ok, but you can always get a USB hub for more slots.","I am a software engineer by profession and I was looking for a powerful laptop which can run resource intensive developer tools. At the same time I needed it to be compact and easy to handle, so that my wife can also find it useful. Acer Spin 3 convertible laptop was an answer to that. Performance of this laptop is really impressive. This is a great deal and value for money.","This computer is absolutely stunning. Thanks to Prime day it was only $700 and its specs are amazing. Can\u2019t wait to use this for college!","The lap top is easy too use and can be used differently. The tablet capabalities is very useful, and easy to use, especially with the pen that comes with it.","I love the laptop, it's fast, touch screen is really nice, fingerprint reader is great, but the battery life is horrid. On half brightness it lasts like 4 hours if that.","Everything is great about this Laptop except one thing .... the battery life is nowhere what Acer advertises. Yet, I would buy iot again","Seems to work great so far but this is by far the loudest fan I have ever heard on a laptop.  Every laptop has its bad features:  with the lenovo yoga it's the impossibly glitchy screen, the Asus' silver keyboard is very hard to see, and this one's fan is distractingly loud.  At least the screen and keyboard are good!","Great little laptop havent done a whole lot on it but start up time is great and speed seems to be fantastic!","Overall I am thrilled with this laptop. Had it a few weeks now and no issues to date.  Boots extremely fast and the fingerprint reader is excellent. Also, the display is incredibly sharp.  It's not a super light weight but manageable.  Also, not loaded with bloatware you get from some of the other vendors.","Excellent hardware configuration for this price.  Fast and great display.  I am a very happy camper!","Great laptop.  Graphics are vivid,  stylist works great,  touch screen great. I'm very pleased with it so far.  Easy set up.","Best laptop config at this price point with all that you need. Was $100 less on Prime slae\u263a bought it .","Love this laptop.  Got it up and running very quickly. My laptop is always on the move - I take it from one room to another during the evenings. This laptop is very lightweight, so it's easy to grab and go. Best purchase I've made in a long time.","I use it to edit photography and it is seriously fast.  I wish it had at least a TB of storage would be cool if it was a SSD. Other nice to have would be a stand-alone GPU But that and a SSD are understandably not in the cards based on the price tag. That being said for the price it is amazing.","For the price this is a great computer. I was able to get it on sale on Prime Day. I've been using it for over a month. It's fast and works great for streaming.","I received the product today. As soon as you turn on the device you're able to notice how amazingly built it was. The touchscreen is very responsive and the smart pencil functions perfectly. It looks and feels like a durable product, I'm impressed by the apparent cost-benefit of this laptop. Definitely recommended!","It\u2019s thin, light and well built. I bought it for my daughter in college. She really likes it. I own several Acer laptops and desktops for home and business, they are all good. Well equipped and reasonably priced.","Love it! So fast! Battery last forever! Very fast!","Nice LT, and weight, Compact and good quality..","I like the laptop. I had an issue with the first laptop that I ordered as the touch pad did not work. After trying several things to fix it like adding the drivers and setting it to the original factory settings both which did not work, Amazon quickly sent me another laptop. So far it is working fine.","Beautifully designed, runs very smoothly and quickly. The fingerprint scanner works very well!","Hasta el momento sin problemas","So far its good. Haven't used it much, so don't  know about battery life!","I love these one really want perfect any is really fast also thank you Acer to do better work? I loved","Solid product, excellent delivery, good price, we are happy","That what I wanted \ud83d\udc4d","works as designed","I got the product after a long wait and I was really hoping it to be good and ta-da, it was the best! Thank you Acer for the awesome laptop. Product quality is Excellent. Touch screen and laptop size are super awesome. It rotates around the hinge and that looks superb.","Just started it up and messed around on it, seems like it can handle everything, using it for high school. Started up quickly and worked great.","i love it!","It is an amazing device. It was the perfect gift for my daughter, for school and university, she is very happy with all features machine. I know I done my best buying it in Amazon, very good experience, thanks !","This is a good laptop for my needs. I use it to program, specifically using Visual Studio. So far it seems to be powerful enough to do what I need it to. Battery life isn't that great. I get maybe 8 hours total. Other than that I am glad I purchased this.","its fine","overall, it's a great machine, but the fan can get kind of loud every 5 minutes or so. the fan does seem to have a variable operating speed, which is a plus. I've had no lag, delays, etc. overall very pleased.","I love love love how fast this laptop is!","Nice light computer. Very fast. Works perfectly.","I liked the specifications of this device. I am not happy with the voice of the fan because sometimes it's loud. I had a 14-inch device and I feel the screen is small but that's just me."],"24":["I\u2019ve been using this Chromebook for about a week prior to writing this review. So far, I\u2019m impressed with the amount of value Samsung brought to this device. The N3060 processor is perfectly suitable for my daily tasks. This Chromebook is able to stream 1080p\/60fps videos, load ad\/image-heavy websites relatively fast, multitask without slowdown, and run Android apps\/games well. For example, 3d games such as Max Payne, GTA San Andreas, and Star Wars KOTR from the Google Play Store are perfectly playable at their default settings (If you\u2019re wondering about the controller, the DualShock 3 is compatible with this model). As for the general build quality, I have no complaints. The spill-resistant keyboard is comfortable to type on, the mousepad is responsive, and the design of this laptop both looks and feels more premium than the price suggests. The only downside I have for this laptop is the screen. Compared with my old Chromebook, the Acer Chromebook 11 (2016), it\u2019s no contest. The IPS screen on the Acer Chromebook has much better viewing angles and the colors are more saturated. That being said, I wouldn\u2019t say that the screen on the CB3 is bad. The colors are decent when you find an optimal viewing angle and the anti-reflective screen is well suited for brightly-lit environments. You can tilt the screen about 30 degrees outside of the optimal viewing angle before the colors get washed out. Also, I've had no issues running this Chromebook through my 1080p monitor. In the future, the Samsung Chromebook 3 will have Linux support with Crostini. Currently, you can switch this Chromebook to the Canary channel to test this feature out. Unfortunately, I was unable to get Linux to work because of mounting issues. Hopefully Google will get this feature ironed out in the future, since having 64gb of storage is optimal for installing a plethora of Linux apps. To conclude this review, I\u2019d recommend this Chromebook to anyone that wants to install both Linux apps (either with crouton or crostini) and Android Apps on their Chromebook. Having 50gb of usable internal storage makes this Chromebook an excellent device to use both online and offline. Pros 1. Decent processor with 4gb of RAM 2. Anti-glare screen 3. Comfortable keyboard and responsive trackpad 4. Less than $300 5. 8-10 hours of battery life 6. Google Play is supported and Crostini (Linux apps inside Chrome OS) is coming in the near future. Cons 1. Colors get washed out when the screen is tilted out of optimal range. 2. Quiet speakers *Update - 1.5 months later* The Samsung Chromebook 3 officially supports Crostini Linux in the beta channel. Even though I initially had a few issues getting the terminal to install on this Chromebook, Linux apps work quite well. For example, the Libre Office suite (a Linux substitute for Microsoft Office) works very well and I haven't experienced any crashes with it. The same thing can be said for Filezilla, Gimp photo editor, and GnuCash. However, if you're using Linux apps that rely on sound and video\/graphics (Spotify desktop, VLC Media Player, watching videos through Firefox, games with Steam), the performance is quite laggy and all of these apps have audio problems (scratchy audio or none at all). Therefore, it still has a long ways to go when it comes to replacing a dedicated Linux distro. If you're interested with a smoother Linux experience with this Chromebook, I'd recommend installing Gallium OS and dual boot it with chrx. I was able to get Counter Strike GO playable through steam (at very-low graphics) and the rest of the apps I've had problems with in Crostini worked in Gallium.","So, I'm going to be comparing this Chromebook with the really well rated Asus Flip.  I wouldn't have changed, except for the fact that the screen on my Flip cracked when I was bumped into and dropped my backpack. Pros: It just looks more expensive\/high end. The Asus Flip, in my opinion, looks cheap. This laptop looks like a sleek little machine. The screen is sharper and the colors are brighter. Nearly $80 cheaper for the same specs. The Flip has a touch screen, sure, but not a very good one. I constantly found it registering touches all the way across the screen from where I touched. The hinge feels very durable, far more durable than the Flip. The Flip hinge wobbled every time I even used the touchscreen. Touchpad flows a lot better and it's slightly bigger. HDMI port, SD card port, and 2 USB-A ports. Good enough! Cons: The keyboard is noticeably smaller, so I find myself making a few typing mistakes. I'm sure this will go away as I use the laptop more and more. The charger!!! Really, Samsung? A unique charger in this day and age? It was so nice to only have to carry one charger for my phone, laptop, and Switch (USB-C for all 3). This laptop has a unique charger and it's really irksome. The future is USB-C, and I'm not sure why Samsung refuses to jump onboard. Like other reviews have said, it does get smudgy. I would invest in a skin or a hard snap on case. Overall, for the price, it is great. I bought this in a pinch because my Flip screen is totally destroyed from the drop and I'm a college student who needs a laptop. I would definitely recommend this laptop over the Flip.","It's light and simple. The battery doesn't last as long as it claims. Only 6 hours when I unplug it when its fully charged. It's small and great but doesn't have an all caps button.","This is my 1st laptop after tablets and an ipad. I really like it. I've got medical issues keeping me home a lot of the time and learning how to use this was easier than expected. I'm not an expert on electronics but I give this piece  of equipment 5 stars. Thank you to Samsung for this device.","This thing is awful. It is crazy slow, like early 90s slow, there is no reason this product should be this slow in 2019. I was hoping to use this to help me run my Etsy store but its print capability is an absolute joke. The screen quality is terrible also, my father's hand me down laptop from the 90s had better quality than this screen does. Imagine an average screen quality with poorly applied protective plastic film left on, that's almost as bad as this. I'm sorry I keep referencing the 90s but I just can't believe that Samsung of all companies would put their name on this piece of garbage in 2019! I can pretty much do more on my phone than this thing. I wanted to return this but the return window closed last week so now I'm stuck with this thing. My review is soley to encourage you to NOT purchase this product.","I love Samsung products.  I had a Samsung Microwave.  I have a Samsung 10.1\" Tablet, & I have a 32\" Samsung Flat Panel Tv.  I rarely if ever have had any issues with any of their products, until now. The picture screen on this Samsung Chromebook at 11.6\" is barely larger than my Samsung 10.1\" Tablet.  If you are used to having and using a standard sized laptop, you will be in for a shock with this, at how small it is. Mine came with a Quick Start Guide & Warranty Booklet, but the Owners  Manual, which you can download the PDF here on the product page, or thru Samsung.com, it's literally 73 pages long!  I called Tech Support, was told they could mail it to me, then was told they couldn't.  No Owners Manual should be 73 Pages long for ONE language! Over the course of 3 days I have called Samsung Tech Support 4 times.  They seem knowledgeable, but all have very strong accents, if you live in the U.S.A., which makes things more difficult when dealing with a new product, to explain your issue. My biggest issue is when it comes to printing.  Forget about Click & Print!  I have a Brother All In One Printer, less than a year old.  I had to call both Brother Tech Support, as well as Samsung Tech Support, so that I could print.  I have an entire page of handwritten notes just to print!  I doubt I can scan, etc.  It uses both the I CLOUD Beta Printing, as well as my Brother All In One to print.  Unlike both my Android Tablet & Android Phone, where all I had to do was get the Brother Plug In App through The Google Play Store, and could either download or print, etc. With this Samsung Chromebook you have to basically download and save the document, but then there are about 6-8 \"this opens another window\" instructions BEFORE it actually prints whatever it is you want to print.  Way too much for what is supposed to be a fairly simple Chromebook, so you might want to think twice about buying this  if printing is important to you.  I've always had a printer with a computer. I doubt I will be using this Chromebook for printing!  I also noticed that when using Chrome for your Search that pages don't always load correctly.  I had that issue with Amazon.com. I didn't want Windows 10, and I already have a tablet, so it was suggested to me by Best Buy that maybe a Chromebook would be an option.  I am not sure that it will work for my needs, but if you are mainly buying it to check email, things like that, this will probably work fine for you. Yes it does have Google Play Store loaded on it.  There is also a Chrome Web Store. It is nice that it updates automatically when you turn it on, that there are no Windows Updates since the Operating System is Chrome, which I always thought Chrome was just a search engine, like Firefox or Internet Explorer.  No need for Mal ware or Norton either. I think the picture on this is fair, not great.  I have a sound bar attached to it for better sound. Now I am just trying to figure out if the pluses of having this Samsung Chromebook outweigh the negatives.  I haven't made up my mind yet! I purchased mine Used, Like New in Original Packaging through Amazon Warehouse on Amazon.  Normally I buy everything new when it comes to electronics, after having a bad experience with one refurbished item.  They shipped very fast, it was packaged well,  the item does look new, and after contacting Samsung with the Model # & Serial #, I found that I still had 10  months left on the One Year Warranty. FINAL UPDATE- I am returning this to Amazon, only my second purchase to return since 2001.  That's how long i have been an Amazon Customer, and A Vine Voice since 2009. In the few days that I've had it, it has been a constant source of frustration, not what I anticipated at all when I purchased it. Have had printer issues where something should print but doesn't.  I can't even get Amazon's web page to load correctly through Google Search. I thought that this Samsung Chromebook might be a good alternative for me, instead of purchasing another laptop. I really didn't want Windows 10, but I need something that can do what I need it to do, which this can't, at least not for me.  Funny thing is, I was just trying to do basic things on it- checking email, going to a web page, printing. After speaking to Samsung Technical Support once again today, I was told that Chromebooks are mainly for students, a lower cost alternative to a computer.  It was suggested to me to buy one of their larger Chromebooks.  No thanks! I am done with Chromebooks! Back to looking at laptops!  I wish that this had worked out for me.  I am sad that it doesn't.  Hopefully it will work for some of you.  I always get the bad apple in the bunch!","As a retiree, it serves me well. A great value","It was exactly what my husband needed, works great","I\u2019m a high school student and our school has very similar chromebooks so I decided to buy one. Oh boy it\u2019s so convenient! I seriously love this chromebook. I mean, there\u2019re definitely better, more expensive ones out there but I think this one is more than enough. For me I do a lot of my work on google and with google apps - chromebooks work so well with them. I think it\u2019s fairly stylish and the size is very portable - I can easily stuff it in my backpack and bring it everywhere with me. I haven\u2019t encountered a lagging problem so far despite having at least 25+ tabs open at once (I work on different projects and it\u2019s very convenient this way). Battery life is amazing as well, and charges super fast. It can easily get through whole school day (~2-5 hours of use on average) on 50% battery and I\u2019ve never had it die on me once. Definitely not for gaming but this chromebook is super convenient for work and studying.","As a Mac user i was a little hesitant to buy a ChromeBook at all for my kid. But this seems like a reasonably specced machine and it's getting a ton of use from my son. The only complaint is that ChromeOS makes it difficult to run things like Python (which is something he wants to learn). But installing google play apps is a breeze, and there are parental control options. No complaints about speed or screen quality here. I wish it used a USB-C charger rather than a proprietary plug.","Love it!","This chromebook is faster than others I've owned and has a decent amount of on board storage for my needs.  Great for internet browsing and works well with word processing and spreadsheet programs.  Seamlessly streams Hulu , Tidal hifi, etc.  A definite step up from my short-lived ASUS chromebook. I have a 2012 Samsung chromebook that's still working well despite being dropped multiple times.  The cracks and dents give it character.  Hopefully this one will be just as bullet proof.  These things all look like siblings, but Samsung seems to be working better for me.","If you need a light weight computer to do normal tasks on then this is great. It does everything a normal internet user would use no problem, like streaming, browsing, and basic accounting\/etc. However it is not a good option for anyone looking to download and use heavy programs, play heavy games, or run multiple processes.","I wanted a cheap Chromebook and I guess I got what I paid for. The screen is really, really bad for 2019. The viewing angles are terrible: I mean if you move your head an inch you won't be able to see anything. The computer also runs pretty slow. I expected the browser at least to be snappy, but everything loads slowly. The only good thing about this Chromebook is the battery life and solid construction. Otherwise the functionality of chromeOS is pretty good. As a college student I don't feel myself needing to switch back to Windows for browsing and basic file editing. Overall I'd recommend spending a bit more for a decent Windows laptop or just a better Chromebook.","The computer itself is a bit slow, lags a bit when playing Youtube and trying to load different tabs on the internet browser. I would recommend spending a bit extra to get something better.","Since I am retired, I no longer need a computer powerhouse.  This Chromebook does everything I want to do while traveling.  It's small, light weight, and secure.  A great computer for the price!","so the Chromebook wont run the Kindle App or MLB App, I had hoped it would do everything my older Samsung tablet would do with the benefits of a keyboard. Yeah, nope. I'll just get a new tablet.","My daughter is 24 and has disabilities.  She prefers to be as independent as possible.  This is the first computer she\u2019s had that I didn\u2019t have to set up for her.  She\u2019s enjoying using it very much.  Since she uses Google drive for all her work items it\u2019s perfect!","A week after this was delivered, I plugged it in and charged it.  (I was out of town when delivered) It seemed fine when I tried it out.  It was a gift.  A couple of weeks later I went to use it and the battery was dead.  Plugged it in and went on my way.  Checked it later and battery still dead.  Changed outlets but still nothing.'s past the send back time and it is useless.  Hoping I can find another charger for it and that will work.","Bought this for my wife who uses it for school (both as a student and teacher). Couldn't ask for a better device. It's light, fast and has pretty decent battery life. It would be great if it had a touchscreen, but I don't think it's worth paying an extra $100 for a feature that would barely get used. As others have cautioned, this is a Chromebook which runs Chrome OS, so don't expect standard Windows applications to run on it. We haven't run into any issues with that limitation, but it's good to familiarize yourself with Google apps to make sure they'll work for how you'll use it.","Needed a new computer quickly. This is a bridge one and it will do until we can replace it. The screen is much too small for old eyes.","Very pleased with this product. I haven't yet had an opportunity to utilize all its functions, but I'm happy to know that I now have a go-to alternative to the 10 year old hp that is now so antiquated and sluggish that it's nearly useless. This chromebook will be very useful, I think, once kids have school projects. Glad I spent the extra $ for more speed and memory. Also, cancelling Norton was an added bonus- since this unit isn't bogged down with pre-loaded \"stuff.\"","All I do is surf the web, read email and watch videos.  Knocked it down one star as audio can be hard if you have it sitting on your lap but earbuds take care of that issue.  Battery life is incredible.  Simple and easy to use.","I bought this for my daughter as she needed the chrome book for school.  This was the one recommended by an I.T. Guy.  We received it within days.  I was extremely surprised at how light it was.  My daughter had it up and running in no time. The battery life is awesome!!! The keyboard was awkward for me only because I am used to a full-size lap top keyboard.  The only issue I had was it took me quite some time to set it up and connect it to our printer.  I was concerned I I would now have to buy a printer new printer that would be compatible. That being said, I am sure a majority of that was operator error and our printer is 5 years old.  However after some time and having to use my phone to follow the directions it finally connected. The little bit I have used this, I am very, very impressed!!! I am even contemplating switching to this when my iPad crashes.","never tried it  was just to small 4 me  be great if you want a compact ''","I'm no chromebook expert, but it meets all my needs for using all of Google apps. I write and read a lot, so being able to use kindle, audio books, Google docs, and having everything saved for me on Google drive is perfect. Im also a blogger, and write papers so this is great. In the future I will be getting a better quality, more up-to-date chromebook, but till then this does what I need it to do... I just wish there was a way to turn off the mouse pad when my bluetooth mouse is connected.","I ordered the used in very good condition, and it looks like brand new. I needed an inexpensive laptop for work and it does what I need it to do. Plus it has twice as much memory as most of the ones sold elsewhere.","If you want to game this is a no go, but if you want to either have a chill safe computer or you wanna be able to code on different OS this is where it\u2019s at. Literally no in between. You can use office 365, use it for school,work, open you\u2019re own damn business with this thing but don\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna be play classic WoW or even running runescape on it because you won\u2019t lol but it\u2019s great laptop","It's compact, easy to set up and use. I don't do much on a computer so it's perfect for some one not tech savvy. The pricing was fantastic !!","The computer is very good for student. The touch screen is very sensitive and flexible. It is good to buy with the price.","I needed something to travel with and didn't want to lug my large and expensive computer.  This Chrome Book is perfect.  I have access to the files I need - on an SD card I added and in the cloud.  Google Drive and apps enable me to edit and view my files, emails, etc.","This is my second Chrome laptop, spilled coffee on my first one.  I ordered a Samsung for my next one.  I have enjoyed this laptop.  It is easy to operate and charges quickly.  The charge last all day.  I am keeping coffee far away from it !","All chromebooks are good. Better than anything else","Perfect for kids\/homework etc","Fair quality and wireless connection poor","Opening this up for the first time and trying to change my profile setting the computer froze twice, for about a minute each time. When I use spotify the audio is choppy if I'm loading other things online. There is no right click option you have to use a shortcut to do so. There is also no caps lock.","This screen broke within 2 weeks of using it. Amazon wouldn\u2019t replace and Samsung refused to fix the item.","Wish I had know you couldn't move apps to the SD card.  May end up selling it on eBay and just getting a laptop.","I wasn't expecting it to do much- but it worked so well and it's so easy to use and light. It was one of the BEST investment- excellent condition. If I had to I would definitely purchase it again.","It doesn\u2019t charge right","Like the quickness of this laptop. Almost never lag and a very quick start up.","It is not touch screen , I don\u2019t understand the rating request","It seems to be a great chromebook so far.  Haven't used it a ton yet.

Easy to use.","Good quality"],"25":["I was excited to receive this laptop as I have been using a 13\" Lenovo Thinkpad that has been acting up of late.  Before it dies entirely; I figured it was time for a new laptop. The laptop arrived packed well - the laptop packaged in the typical fiberboard form fitting packing, in a Acer box.  This was packed in a larger box for additional protection that is typical for Amazon - it protected the laptop well. The laptop comes with a power supply and a kit that provides the cable and mounts to install a second HDD. Make sure you plug in the laptop or it will not allow the setup to commence. Cortana promptly comes up and guides you through the setup process - you can acknowledge choices via voice or mouse input. The setup process is typical Windows 10 and proceeded smoothly with no issues from start to finish.  I was up running and saving favorite websites in a few minutes! What I like: This PC has a \"SSD\" (Solid State Drive) - what this means is that the main storage is electronic (like the chip in a cell phone) - as such access times are very fast - improving the boot time (about 20 seconds!) and speed of the laptop.  An SSD is also more reliable and potentially long lived versus a \"HDD\" (Hard Disk Drive) - a failed HDD is often the end of most PCs.  This is a fantastic feature and value in an inexpensive \"budget\" PC! There are plenty of connection options available on the sides of the PC - an ethernet port, two \"standard\" USB ports, a USB C port, an HDMI port and the power connection grace the left side of this PC - another \"Standard\" USB port, a headphone jack and a place to connect a lock cable on the right side. Display is great - there is a very thin bezel that surrounds the screen - about 1\/4\" on the sides and maybe 1\/2\" on the top.  The display is also 1080P and very clear - I just watched a 1080p test video on YouTube and it looks fantastic!  Streaming is smooth with no lagging as well.  We have very good Wifi at our house so your performance in this area may vary.  Its also welcome to be using a larger 15\" display as it is significantly larger than the 13\" I have been using. The look of this PC is also stunning - a brushed aluminum cover with matching plastic finish elsewhere - looks clean and classy. The keyboard is also big - great for my rather large hands - the keys have a nice tactile click and are responsive. Have not used it enough to confirm battery life but assume it will be good as the SSD uses much less power than a HDD.  Also, I understand that the Intel processor is rather efficient and less power hungry than others - as with any PC - screen brightness, heavy gaming or other processor intensive activities will use the battery more quickly. What Could Improve?: The most notable shortcoming is the amount of RAM provided - 4GB.  This is really insufficient by today's standards but it is upgradeable to 16GB and for basic web surfing, watching videos, editing spreadsheets or presentations or tending to email the 4GB will still work well - remember the SSD does enhance speed and performance overall as well. A VGA port - I know that these are going the way of the dinosaur but it still is a rather common connector for older projectors or AV systems - I need one to connect to our system for presentations at work.  An inexpensive HDMI to VGA adaptor quickly solved this for me. A larger SSD would be amazing - I get it though, this is a \"Budget PC\" and the very fact that it has an SSD versus an HDD is impressive! Video chip is average - ok for watching streaming videos but assume it would struggle with heavy video editing or heavy graphics gaming - not an issue for me. Windows 10 in \"S\" mode is a hassle - does not allow you to install any program not available in the Store - I had some issues opting out of S Mode (Microsoft issue) - they resolved and I opted out in order to to install Microsoft Office 2010 - no more issues! Overall, Acer makes a great budget PC - they are generally reliable and the SSD in this model makes it a solid choice.  Highly recommend! EDIT:  I have used this laptop for about two weeks and cannot believe just how good it is!  I have had many laptops over the years - my first being a 486 based \"Gateway\" running DOS and an old version or windows along with multiple others over the years.  This is clearly my favorite!  The SSD makes for AMAZING fast boot times - from pressing the power button to reaching your desktop is achieved in under 20 seconds- crazy fast!  I just installed Microsoft office, the \"Team Viewer\" app and \"Citrix Receiver\" (allows for remote access to my office PC) & the chrome browser - my plan is to keep this laptop \"clean\" without excess programs that might slow it down.  The battery life so far has been excellent - I just charge it after several uses - hasn't been below 60% yet.  I was initially considering upgrading the RAM but have not seen the need the 4mb appears to suffice for me.  If you are on the fence about this purchase - GO FOR IT - I guarantee that you will not be disappointed! Edit#2 - 6 week update - this laptop still amazes me every day - the boot times remain crazy fast, seems that I can type faster on this keyboard than ever before - although specs seem to be \"budget\" this is clearly the best performing laptop - including Macs that I have ever used!","The battery takes extremely long to charge Edit: I\u2019m an idiot the charger wasn\u2019t fully plugged","I've been using computers since the Intel 8088 processor hit the market via the first IBM PC...well truth be told, we came out at the same time  in June of 1979. I feel somewhat like the old man relaying how they walked to school, up hill both ways, in the snow, with no shoes on, saying this but when that device came out, it cost the equivalent of $5,000 ~ $10,000 USD today. Fast forward to 2007 when I purchased my Mac Book Pro for $2,500 to do high-end Graphic design on, with a Core 2 Duo, 2GB DDR2 RAM and 5400RPM HDD....and now....I just purchased a budget buy of a PC that puts them both utterly to shame. I say these things because it has a large bearing on the decision to purchase this laptop. I just finished repairing and upgrading my mother in laws laptop from 2011 that cost more than this but had now where near the performance, even for it's time. Granted, this is not a gaming PC as it does not have a dedicated graphics card but it has enough to push the envelope of what we consider a budget PC. Also worth noting is that this laptop is a replacement for my Dell M6700 workstation laptop that got murdered by lightning. The 8th gen i3 is only half of the overall power of the i7 that was in my M6700. But! the \"Single Thread Rating\" of the newer i3 is significantly better...and let's face it, even many of the graphic design tasks I do are really only single threaded applications. So, all that extra power was usually not even being tapped. My CPU was usually only at 25% doing HD renderings in Blender. That's definitely worth considering when buying a device, what are the needs of your tasks? If they are single thread tasks, like most non gaming tasks, then an i3 performs quite well, so long as you don't over multi-task by running to many applications at once. It's got DDR4, which is an obvious advantage over DDR3 systems. But even systems that cost more than twice as much are being sold with 5400RPM HDDs. There are very significant performance differences between SSD and HDD systems and the fact that this laptop comes with NVMe drive, which outperforms both SSD and HDD, gives it a solid edge over other budget PCs. Being only 4GB of RAM can be concerning, especially for things like photo and video editing...but I used to do that with 2GB or RAM and it is easily upgradable to 20GB. 128GB of storage is not a lot either by today's standards, but for $50 yo can add in a decent 2TB HDD for storage...i just so happened to already have one because of my  system that died. I also redirect my Desktop, Downloads and Documents to the secondary drive to help keep the OS drive clean...worth Google-ing to do yourself. The display is great! it was important to me to get something that is Full HD 1080. I was very near to buying something in the tablet range just because most laptops in this class are only 1366 x 768. it is also not glossy, which I rather prefer. In most cases, glossy screens create in consistent results because of reflecting too much of the environment. It is also very thin and light weight. This was a very important factor since my M6700 was twice has heavy and twice as thick. Overall, I'd say this laptop is the perfect balance of budget pricing with mid level performance.","Purchased this computer and thought Wow this is fantastic.  Fast and crystal clear colorful screen.  After spending time removing all the bloatwear, all of a sudden there was a grinding chopping noise. I thought that maybe I accidentally hit a button for a video to play on the internet.  All programs were closed. I called Acer and held the phone up to the laptop so the tech could hear the sound. We laughed it sounded like a monster was eating a tree.  I only had the computer two days. Acer said it was a hardware problem and to return the computer.  Although I sent it back I\u2019m considering ordering it again. Things happen and the customer service was great. 2nd review. Returned the laptop and purchased it again. I loved the computer and figured that the static grinding noise was just one of those things. Well i reordered the same computer and now I'm extremely irritated because after setting up the computer that awful static grinding noise started up. I googled the problem and found that there are numerous people listed in reviews and forums that also have the same grinding noise. Also this static\/ grinding noise is on several Acer models since 2013.  This computer is also being returned","I choose this computer over the Acer Aspire 5 with the AMD Ryzen 3 processor. Its faster and overall its an excellent computer that meets all my needs","I had three older computers and decided to replace all with this one.  It is light enough to use on your lap like my old notebook.  It is extremely fast startup and website opening.  Fast than my I7 refurb that cost about the same as this.  Have been using for only one week so far it is top drawer.  The battery lasts over 10 hours.  I highly recommend this product for the average user.","The major components are excellent. I want to love this laptop. I have run Ubuntu Linux on it along with Windows 10. Even with only 4GB RAM and 128GB eNVM it is very usable. It does have a serious flaw. The touchpad has a problem with recognizing a single finger tap verses a double tap. Quite often it will recognize a single tap as a double tap. Sometimes it will not recognize a single finger tap at all. Even with pressing down to make it click. Working in a application like a browser you can deal with it. While coding or writing in multiple documents it is unusable. I will fiddle with the sensitivity and toggling off some touchpad features, but this about to be sent back. In addition, it appears Acer manufacturing has changed this A515-54 model to no longer have two DDR4 RAM slots and a spare SSD connection. Instead it has one spare DDR4 RAM slot and no additional storage connections. This makes the Aspire 5 line less interesting with a max 20GB instead of 32GB RAM and no upgrade options for storage. I am disappointed. I really wanted to love this laptop. Instead I am likely to return it and seriously consider other manufacturers. Updated: I figured out the touchpad cannot handle a tap or touch within a inch or two for dragging or selecting. Almost has to be click bottom and drag from top. Usable now I know the quirk. Updated to 3 stars. Still down 2 stars for only supporting 20GB RAM rather than the stated 32GB.","bought first acer july 2018, very good laptop, this new one that came out in may 2019, is faster, sleek, lighted keyboard  &brighter screen, all in all a great value for $349.99 you want be disappointed. l.counts","Initial Review Aug 1, 2019 Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop, 15.6\" Full HD IPS Display, 8th Gen Intel Core i3-8145U, 4GB DDR4, 128GB PCIe NVMe SSD, Backlit Keyboard, Windows 10 in S mode, A515-54-30BQ Overview Overall this is a pretty nice laptop for the price. It has some nice features, some missing features, and one glaring negative issue for me. Acer is of course a good brand. They've been making great laptops for years. What's included: - The Laptop - The power cord and brick - Paperwork including a brief Setup Guide - A hard disk (or SSD) adapter frame and HDD ribbon cable. Design, and Construction This is a good looking modern laptop. It has an all plastic and has a plastic feel but I do think it will hold up well. The back of the screen is aluminum. The laptop is about 4 pounds which is about average for this class of laptop. The laptop is also reasonably thin and would easily slip into a backpack. The edges are smooth, fan sound is not too loud, opening and closing requires a fingernail as there is no slot to grab. The screen clarity is great and has a wide viewing angle. The track pad is responsive. Features Keyboard feel keyboard is nice to type on (I'm a touch typist). Shift and enter keys are in the right place and of the standard size. The small numeric keyboard will please some. The backlight keyboard has only on\/off, no levels of brightness. The backlighting stays on for about 30 seconds, then shuts off to save battery power. I consider a backlit keyboard a requirement and it's good to see this computer includes that feature. Ports - One USB 3.1 port type C. This greatly expands some of the features of the laptop including the ability to charge a phone from the laptop, or charge the laptop from an external battery. - Two USB 3.0 ports - One USB 2.0 port. - HDMI Port - 802.11ac WiFi - Bluetooth 5.0 - Gigabit Ethernet - Webcam Performance I ran streaming video from youtube which worked well. The speakers, at full volume, are just okay for a quiet environment. The sound was clear but the volume was limited. Given the options of using the 3.5mm headphone jack, or Bluetooth speakers\/headphones, I didn't consider this a big issue. After upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Home, I loaded the powerful photo editor Acdsee Pro 7 64 bit and it performed quickly while editing a 24megapixel photo. I did notice a slight reduction in speed compared to my desktop but that is to be expected. The speed of photo editing was quite acceptable. Could not run Chrome browser in S mode. Upgradeability  The RAM can be updated max 20GB. I left it at 4GB. I was intrigued by the included hard drive adapter and cable. It captured my attention that there might be space for a hard drive so I stopped everything else and looked into it. I opened the back, located a spare 256GB SSD I had and installed it. I needed help from ACER youtube video to install the HDD cable. Once physically installed it just worked! There is now 256GB of extra storage, assigned as a D drive, which I think makes a major difference. Now there is room for some real programs and data. Computer seems a little laggy but not bad. It wasn't slow enough to be a bother. My other computer is a quite fast desktop to compare with. Operating System The computer comes loaded with Windows 10 S which is a restricted ability operating system. It restricts the ability to load any other programs than those available in the Microsoft Store. It also makes Microsoft Edge the default, and only, browser I can use. I couldn't even load the Chrome browser let alone try to run it. Only those apps in the Microsoft Store can be loaded and used. Perhaps this would be okay with you in which case go ahead and buy this computer. For me Windows 10 S is completely unusable. I don't use any Microsoft apps, but I do use quite a few other programs that won't run under Windows 10 S. Microsoft says Windows 10 S is faster and more secure than Windows 10 Home and other programs that could then be loaded. I'm sure if you don't load large powerful programs, and you load less apps, the computer can run faster. But it is still the same processor, RAM, and storage either way. I'm not so sure the marketing for Windows 10 S tells the true story. One of the first things I attempted to do was upgrade from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Home. I checked several web sites which gave instructions on how to do that. But every site gave instructions that didn't match this laptop. It seems the wording and process have recently been changed. I was unable to find a straight forward means of doing the upgrade. I spoke with both Microsoft and ACER who told me I would have to purchase Windows 10 Home. That would more than $100 to the cost of bringing this computer up to a reasonable performing laptop. Finally what did work was I loaded a copy of the photo editor I use on the laptop. When I completed that step the laptop had somehow automatically updated from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Home. Finally all of my programs, Quicken, TurboTax, the photo editor, a video editor, Family Tree Maker, and others will now load and run. Pros: - Good list of ports including USB 3.0 and USB C - Good display with wide viewing angles - Nice keyboard that I find easy to type on - Backlit keyboard - Bluetooth 5.0 - 802.11ac wireless - Stated 9.5 hours of battery run time - Aluminum screen back - Can be upgraded with a 7mm HDD or SSD. Cons: - No touch-screen. We have a desktop computer and two other laptops. The desktop does not have a touch screen and I'm not tempted to use my finger on the non-touch screen monitor. However our phones, tablets in the family, and the laptops all have touch screens. Every time I use this ACER laptop I'm tempted to touch the screen but alas it isn't a touch-screen display. This is my biggest complaint about this laptop. - Small storage. Only 128GB would have seemed like a lot five years ago, or on one of today's cell phones. But for a laptop this is so small I would likely run out of space in less than a year. There is only one drive so it has also to contain the Windows Operating System, all applications, and all user data. - Windows 10 S. Microsoft would call this a good feature, touting the added security of running only Microsoft Apps. But I have no use for any of the Microsoft Apps. I use programs that run in desktop mode. All of my programs are large and powerful, unlike the smaller limited feature Microsoft Apps. - When running in Windows 10 S mode only the Microsoft Edge browser can be used. Other browsers such as Chrome cannot be loaded or run. - Slower i3 processor which is to be expected in this price range. Still it seems to perform well. - No memory card reader (would have to carry an adapter dongle). I use a lot of SD and microSD cards so this is an issue for me. - Plastic laptop case Conclusion The bottom line is if you are considering laptops of this low cost there has to be trade-offs. In some cases features you desire can be added but then it may actually be cheaper to buy a slightly more expensive laptop which has the features you want. For casual use such as searching the internet, Facebook, news, weather, college reports, simple non-graphic-intensive games, and such this laptop would serve you well. For heavy duty use such as graphic intensive games, or Video editing, you may want to look for a more powerful system.","I was looking for a low cost notebook I could convert to Linux as a gift for my grandson. With EFI and Windows S it is not trivial to replace Windows but it can be done.  This comes with really good hardware and a crippled OS. My original plan was to replace the original M.2 SSD, it has been described as NVMe but I found otherwise. The EFI would not recognize my real NVMe stick. On examination the original is PCIe but not NVMe. Plan B was activated. I put a 512gb Crucial MX300 SSD in the empty bay. Acer even provided a bracket and the screws necessary in the  package. I also installed an 8gb SODIMM in the empty slot bringing it up to 12gb  total, 4gb is soldered on the motherboard. The IPS display is excellent, much better than a cheap Chromebook. There are ten identical screws on the bottom, I removed these and used a pry tool to remove the bottom cover.  Clearly Acer has intentionally made it easy to work on this, sort of an anti-Apple. In order to get it to boot from a USB stick go into the EFI  options (by pressing F2 at boot) and find the option to enable F12  selection of boot drive. I installed Ubuntu Studio 19.04 with no problems at all.  My grandson is getting a great laptop and it was not too expensive.  With the standard size HDMI connector hooking up to an external monitor is easy. I started in the computer industry in 1978, I've built, repaired and upgraded countless computers of all types. I'm glad I found this one. PROS Excellent full  HD  IPS display Easy to open and upgrade\/service Well known manufacturer Includes bracket to add a 2.5\" SATA SSD Attractive backlit keyboard CONS Body is mostly plastic Windows S is absolutely horrible","My new Acer Aspire 5 arrived yesterday.  I immediately added an extra 8G DDR4 Ram chip to it,  for a total of 12G.;  you simply unscrew the 10 tiny screws on the backplate with a small Phillips head;  slip the backplate off and pop your new DDR4 chip into the little socket provided.  Total time?  About 12 minutes. Really,  the unit is now amazingly fast...  I haven't seen it hiccup or lag yet.  I had opted for the Intel chip version of the Aspire,  as it does have a slightly faster CPU speed.  I immediately opted-out of the Windows 10 \"S\" mode...  which literally took a few seconds to do.  I connected my high-speed internet to the unit via the Ethernet socket,  and proceeded to upgrade all the drivers and firmware for the unit.  I gave the unit a good Defrag and a Registry cleanse,  and I'm good-to-go. I mainly bought this laptop as a way to entertain myself on long airplane flights.  The unit is very light and handsome...  I am mystified by those who point out that the chassis is not more hip 'n' chic looking,  because it looks great to me.  I've also read several pro reviews online which allege that the unit is deeply flawed by a bad-looking monitor display;  I absolutely don't know what they're talking about--  the display looks amazing to me:  super-sharp and clear 1080p,  with natural-looking colors,  perfect brightness and contrast.  Fonts look sharp yet nicely antialiased.  A 15.6\" monitor is perfect real estate to view movies on while traveling,  neither too big nor too small. I will agree with the naysayers who say that the onboard speakers are not very loud,  and the sound quality is not as good as one might wish.  Yep,  those things are true,  but hey,  who expects a laptop to sound like Studio 54?  Usually one will be using headphones anyway,  right?  When watching videos on the VLC Player,  one can tweak their included graphic equalizer in order to get the optimum sound response possible. I will soon be purchasing a mouse for this unit,  as,  at age 56,  I never have gotten the hang of using a touchpad.  I am not a gamer at all,  so am not worried about the power needed to play GTA,  etc.  Although I will take a stab at doing 2D and 3D  artwork in Photoshop and Cinema 4D and see how it goes. All-in-all,  I am very pleased with this new laptop and hope to get lots of good use out of it.  At this price-point,  I don't see that you can do much better.  Highly recommended.","Terrible. Payed 300 dollars for this and it is worse then a $150 chrome book. Off the bat, the headphone jack didn\u2019t work. Tried everything and it still wouldn\u2019t work but figured we\u2019d make do with it. It takes so long for it to process everything, which we didn\u2019t care about, but then the mouse just stopped working randomly. Nothing happened to it, just stopped working. Only a few minutes later after we noticed you can\u2019t even turn it back on again and it says \u201cpreparing automatic repair\u201d. So disappointed, we knew it was no macbook but a computer that\u2019s half the price of this one lasts longer.","I like reading long reviews but don't have the patience to write them myself. If you're looking for a laptop that will handle any web application and very light gaming, this is your best option. Ran Minecraft at full settings solid 60 FPS. But don't buy this expecting to run anything more graphically intensive than some blocks. I bought a Crucial branded 8 GB 2666 MHz SODIMM ram stick. This made the computer go from 4 gigs to 12. 4 really isn't enough if you use chrome and multitask. Anyway, I've only had this computer a day so we will see how it lasts.","Oh My God... this is SUCH a great purchase. I'm not running the Win-10 s mode as I wanted it to be fully functioning - At first I thought for sure I would need more memory, but I haven't it's been awesome! Primarily I use it for Remote desktoping into my Main Custom built SSF-PC which let's it do all the heavy lifting... however recently my wife's macbook air wasn't capable of running her favorite game satisfactorily so I jokingly said, let's just install civ on my Aspire and see if my $300 laptop can outdo Mac's finest... well... it did - A little long on the processing times when she hosted at the end of the game, but never crashed, and fine graphics for what it is. There are two things I would change given the opportunity: I wish I could get was a brighter screen - But it's so cheap for what you are getting... I couldn't believe when looking at the specs that it was priced where it was. And it was an awesome decision. I wish the Charger didn't have the absolutely TINY connection point at the pc. I mean, for this price, I don't expect a magnet mount... but it looks cringingly small and could be bent by a harsh breeze... I'm not sure the longevity of the charging mechanism should even be talked about. But I take great care of my tech, so it shouldn't be a problem for me... however I don't know if I'd trust it in a house with children or college roommates walking over the charging cable. All in all still 4.9 stars for value!","I purchased an Acer laptop 1.5 years ago and have been extremely happy with it. So, when i needed to get a laptop for a family member, getting another one was a no-brainer. Well, i just got this new one and fired it up. VERY NICE. Though the first one i bought is an i5 chip and this one is an i3, i can't tell any difference in performance. Moreover, this new one has a much nicer screen. It's lovely. Since it is going to a college student who also lovers her netflix and youtube, it's going to make her very happy. For the money this machine is fantastic. Great performance, beautiful screen, and lightweight. Haven't run the battery down yet, so can't say about how long it will last on a full charge, but based on my experience with my first Acer, i don't anticipate being let down on that score.","The screen display is really good. There is one spot to add ram I added 16gb for a total of 20gb the 4 gb is soldered part of mother board. The hard drive is a small stick with chips on it smaller then a stick of ram. It is unplugable but really its part of motherboard as well. There is also an empty spot for a 2.5 regular hd drive as well. I plann to install a 250 gb solid state. I bought this to replace my 10 year old aspire wich still works btw. I like it the only reall draw back is the 2 core i3, on a budget though this is it! And way better then the amd chip set. Running my programs ive seen very little cpu usage or ram usage. For medium to low load its great.","I bought this laptop after reading many good customer reviews. But i am extremely disappointed by this acer product. The computer stopped working after about 34 days of off and on use. Called the acer customer service, the tech person asked me to reset the machine to factory condition. Which I did. After that it will not load windows. Again called the tech department, they told me that my laptop needed repair at their repair center in Texas and I will have to pay for shipping. I sent it via UPS insured and got it back in a timely manner with so called, REPAIRED. But, alas the laptop will not even load any web page and responding very slowly. Obviously, they did not check if it was working properly, before mailing it back to me. This is my first acer product and I think, I should not recommend it to any one. I will ship it back again, if they resolve my problem this time, I will change this review.","I'm a student on a budget so I ordered it because it seemed like the best deal for the price. I was worried that it would be slow or that I would have issues with it because it's so cheap, but it's an amazing laptop! The screen quality is great, the keyboard is perfect, no sticky keys, it runs quickly, it plays all the programs I need with no lag, it looks great, and is very lightweight. It's seriously great! I'm actually even able to play the Sims 4 on it with no lag and without having to downgrade the graphics, which was a big surprise for me. I play all my other games on GeForce Now as it allows me to stream games instead of run them on the computer, which is the perfect substitute for buying a gaming laptop. So far the 4gb ram has been enough for me but I will be upgrading to an 8 soon just in case. Overall, this is an amazing laptop, especially for the price. If you are a student, I highly recommend it!","Good news is that Acer is a decent brand that continues to permit end-users to upgrade systems. Great that you can install\/boot from either a standard SATA drive or M.2. Or both (alternately). So you can throw-in another 256Gb SSD drive for cheap. Little cable adapter and sled are included (thank God). NFW can you install another CPU; BGA-soldered onto the MB. The BIOS on this just ABSOLUTELY sucks. This is relevant if you're interested in loading (or reloading) the non-native O.S. If you don't do that kind of thing, this is a well-functioning system for not a lot of dough. Everything is well-balanced and highly functional for the price. Screen is fine. (Anything smaller would suck.) Keyboard and trackpad are adequate. Speed is perfectly adequate for most tasks short of content creation; completely snappy for most tasks. 20gb RAM (with 16mb module) no problem. USB 3.1 works well. Looks good. Pretty thin. Good battery life. NOT THAT LIGHT. If stolen, considering performance\/value\/dollar, I'd buy this same model again. Installed Win10Ent., Office 2K19, bunch of other stuff. It's all basically snappy. Only real complaint is that, using Veracrypt for whole-system encryption, boot and operation is slower than I'd like. But again, it's \"reasonable\" performance\/cost. Internal GPT boot ONLY, no MBR.","I bought this laptop for my son, and it was the first time buying the Acer brand. I am extremely dissapointed with this laptop since it lasted only a month. I took it to the A\/S center and found out that the mother board, and even the hard drive was damaged. Not buying acer ever again.","Some of the negative reviews seem unreasonable. This is a good under $400 laptop. It boots fast (about two seconds), has a great display, handles a few open tabs at once and gets about nine hours on a charge. It\u2019s not a gaming laptop but it\u2019s also not $1,000. I don\u2019t like the location of the power button as others stated. If you\u2019re buying it for a kinda lightweight laptop for surfing, streaming and light computing it\u2019s great. Don\u2019t buy it for gaming and heavy stuff. You\u2019ll be disappointed. But for simple stuff it\u2019s EXCELLENT. I chose the Acer because my last $349 Acer lasted 9-1\/2 years. Buy it!","Nice computer for a personal use computer. I haven't had to have a personal computer in over 15 years, always having one given to me by my employer. It was down for a few weeks (sent for warranty repair) and I went stir crazy not being able to access online payments. I could have done it with a mobile phone, but I have that on me 24\/7, sometimes it's just nice to put the phone down. This computer isn't going to break speed or storage records. I am not a PC gamer, so with routine web surfing for news, sports scores, social media, etc., this computer is more than adequate. Has an awesome display. I watched a movie on here just to check out the picture quality and it was superb. If you are looking for a good machine with adequate storage space, you can't beat this laptop, however if you want something to run some games, I do recommend spending the extra money for more RAM and space. I will ultimately upgrade the space, but for now, it is doing everything I need it to do.","I'm two days in and am becoming slightly frustrated. I like the PC, it was initially fast, but after a few software updates it's lagging terribly and the mousepad is intermittently cutting out now requiring to be switched off and then on again to begin working (probably a software issue). However, the main hardware issue is battery life. It is not working so well with mixed usage and so, realistically, with screen brightness significantly down, if you stream, read articles and write a bit, consider six hours give or take a realistic look. Otherwise, love the screen (my first 1080p one), keyboard is enjoyable and, other than the fan regularly switching on for me and dip in performance the last few hours, the thing is pretty fast.","After an exhaustive internet search for a budget laptop this laptop and the other version with AMD hardware are clearly the best buy for a 15.6 laptop.  The only information I couldn't find before purchasing was the speed of the installed ssd.  The ssd is a Kingston brand and has a speed of 1500 as measured with crystaldiskmark.  I installed a faster ssd which measured 3000 with the same.  I also installed another 4 gig of memory for 8 gigs total which also unlocks dual channel capabilities.  Using the S mode Windows the laptop boots completely in 5 seconds.  It makes an awesome general use machine with no waiting.","Purchased this laptop two weeks ago for my wife. Her 4 year old Toshiba decided to retire. My wife does not do any heavy computing. Facebook, email, shopping, light gaming, and importing and managing pictures. The response time with the Intel I3 is noticeably faster. The solid state hard drive makes no noise. The full HD screen is very crisp with vibrant colors. Set up was simple. Since she doesn't do a lot of down loading the propitiatory windows S is a nice safety feature. Add to the fact that it is a good looking machine, we are quite satisfied.","I chose thise over Aspire 5 with AMD CPU as I think it is better value - longer battery, more efficient memory usage amd bit faster CPU. Touchpad bit wore though. Main advantage of this like is 1080p matte IPS screen which is normally found on more expensive laptops. I dont care about touch on a laptop and will take matte non-touch screen over glossy any time of day or night. Build quality is marginally better on AMD. It also has two memory slots vs one in this which I dont care as extra RAM stick 4 GB (8 GB in total) is everything consumaer laptops needs this days under Win 10 or Linux. Add to that decent size 2.5 inch SSD and it will last for good 5 years or more.","Nice size, fairly well made, but slow. This is the slowest laptop I have ever purchased. If you want Acer, try the Aspire 7 or a Swift model. Won't buy again.","No joke, the fan on this thing is so loud it sounds like a jet engine just doing mundane tasks. And then it ramps up and it's 10x worse! Between this and a dead pixel, I returned it the same day I got it.","If I\u2019d known that there wasn\u2019t a caps lock key light indicator, I\u2019d never would\u2019ve bought the laptop, especially for the money paid, there should\u2019ve been one.","The light weight and screen are probably its best features, but it just overheated. I unpacked it, started it up and immediately switched it to regular Windows 10 mode.  Since then we have used it to view pictures, web sites and do puzzles.  No major processing.  Everyday I drink my morning coffee flipped back in a recliner with the laptop in my lap and do puzzles.  Today, without warning, it shutdown, I lost my half completed puzzle and it wouldn't restart.  I waited about 10 minutes until it would restart.  I run Ccleaner's Speccy to monitor processor temperature and found it would jump up over 70 Centigrade and then drop to 30C all in about 2 seconds.  A bit worrying as the laptop is just out of warranty.  I did a little reading and found that the laptop software when on battery,  controls temperature supposedly by varying processor speed, rather than using active cooling i.e turn on the fan.  I did a little more exploring and found that using the Acer power mode, you can change (?) the cooling from passive, slow the processor,  to active, fan cooling.  Now to see how it does.  By the way, don't tell me I shouldn't have the laptop in my lap, I did it for years with an HP laptop.  This one is supposed to be better.","Have been using this product for 3 months. I am heavy laptop user. Never had performance issue.  Ignore negative reviews. Just buy it if you are looking for day to day use budget laptop Only two issues - CPU Fan is loud  sometimes and speakers are not ao great. But for this price tag, you cant really complain","Great screen, very bright IPS display with good viewing angles. Keyboard feels good to type on. Battery life is great. Windows is reporting 5-6 hours remaining at 75% charge. Note: USB C port cannot be used for charging or video out. Dell WD15 USB C dock does not work at all (no displays detected). The Pluggable USB 3 dual display dock does work; just plug it in. The 4GB of RAM get used up pretty quickly. Just running Chrome task manager is reporting 3.6GB in use. I would recommend adding a 8GB stick of DDR4 2400 which can be done very easily (check youtube for a walk through).","I like the screen resolution of this laptop full hd 1080p. The wifi and the Intel cpu are fast. The computer is easy to upgrade the memory. I did not like the keyboard and the trackpad. I had issues with the keyboard lights not turning on and the touchpad became unresponsive a few times. I choose to return the laptop to Amazon because of the issue with the keyboard and the touchpad. I received full refund from Amazon.com. Thank you.","Overall, I\u2019m pretty satisfied with this Acer Aspire 5, but extremely disappointed there is no place to plug in my camera SD card. Why did they eliminate that? Duh!!!","I purchased this as a replacement because my beloved Mac\u2019s screen was shattered. Although some reviews said it was comparable- I disagree. The screen quality is great and overall works well- however it\u2019s a bit heavier, is not as fast, and I just miss my Mac. For the price however,  it\u2019s an incredible value. I\u2019m glad I made the purchase! It\u2019s all I could afford at this time and all the research was worth it.","Purchased this laptop in September for college courses and it has been able to do everything I have needed it to do so far. Great value for the price. I have had no issues at all and have run multiple programs and had lot of windows open simultaneously. I have even done some light graphic design work on this computer with ease. Is the screen resolution as good as my Apple laptop? No, but this is 1\/4 the price of even the cheapest Mac.","Great value for a laptop with more power than a 7th-gen i7. Purchased for intense browsing and constant-on office work. Never a lag in sight despite the 4GB of RAM (the only con unless you need a larger SSD). I can always upgrade the RAM later if I need it. Highly recommended for these uses.","Bought for my 10 yr old for school.  I wish now I'd had enough to buy 2 or 3. Lasts almost all day of online school. Boots up OMG quickly compared to my several year old Lenovo. Easy enough to opt out of Windows 10S. I did add a 1TB storage drive &16 GB RAM to increase it to a total of 20 GB. The only drawback I have is the screen portion is recessed when closed so you need to use like a thumbnail to open it or at least I do.","I have been using this skinny little laptop for 3 months now and I could not be more pleased. I use it primarily for surfing the web and email and managing videos and photos. I would recommend to anyone looking for an affordable, portable, reliable and sharp laptop.","I saw potential in this laptop, so I upgraded the RAM and SSD (M.2). However, upon upgrading my BIOS to 1.12, I was not able to see the disk to install Linux on the upgraded M.2 SSD. I don't know what to do next except to buy a M.2 enclosure and use the SATA interface to install Fedora. thankfully this thing has the internal real estate and ability to upgrade to a SATA SSD. my rating may change only if Acer decides to","Good quality & durable construction. Processing speed is good for school use but may struggle playing new games on the lowest settings. Its the form and shine of an overpriced laptop for far less and with the ability to upgrade RAM with a single 16 gig card that I liked the most. I actually upgraded to another Aspire model with i7 processor because the platform is so good in my opinion.","Love my laptop. I will try not yo drop this one","Couldn't get the laptop to work at all, even in the s mode.  I tried for most of the day (8 hours) to get it going.  Tried to exit the s mode, didn't work.  Tried to use it as is, didn't work.  Very frustrating experience.  Not condeming Acer, probably just got a lemon.  Ended up getting a chromebook instead at a big box store which was a much more pleasing adventure.  It was nice to get out and see the world.","like it a lot, the only slight complaint is the volume is not very loud but I use a blue tooth speaker, my son will be putting xtra ram and harddrive, which I don't need but my son loves to do these things lol and it doesn't cost much to do it","Shipped very fast.  After charging, booted up in less than 13 seconds. don't forget to disconnect the battery first Very easy to upgrade the ram and the SSD then don't forget to re connect the battery ENJOY, it seems to be a good deal","This computer is a revelation.  My older laptop was seven years old and quite slow.  This ACER boots quickly and  makes web surfing easier by an order of magnitude.  It was easy to set up and the latest version of Microsoft 10 it's loaded with is very easy to adjust to my personal preferences.  Office is also easy to use.  Web streaming is smooth and without the many hesitations and interruptions of my older slower machine.","This is a fantastic laptop. The boot time is unbelievable 5 to 6 seconds.  The screen is great. The battery lasts forever. It is blazing fast even with 10 websites open simultaneously. I purchased it for the screen, the price and because it is very easy to upgrade it.  Now i am returning the memory I purchased for it because I don't see any way I can make something that fast faster. I love the backlit keyboard. Highly recommended.","I am very glad to have this laptop. The quality is just awesome. The screen and graphics are super good as well as the design and the metal case are great. The loading split-second, fast. The very nice keyboard layout. It's lightweight and easy to carry around. Really I like this purchase very much.","I had high hopes for this computer but find webpages VERY slow to load, IF they load at all!!  Can't even load Amazon.  I am writing this review from a old ASUS, and will choose that brand in the future.","YOU CAN'T BEAT THIS ONE FOR THE PRICE! THE PROCESSING SPEED IS AMAZING! THE SCREEN RESOLUTION IS GREAT!

My elementary school age son finds the mouse difficult to use, but adult hands can manage it pretty well. I\u2019m not a computer expert by any means, but for my purposes this works really well. The screen is clear, and we have had no problems.","I decided to keep far from this brand. The machine is OK, but the support is\u2026. My Acer laptop died suddenly without any warning. It automatically rebooted during my working and then showed \u201cNo bootable device\u201d. I searched on internet and found so many people asked the same issue. I contacted the Acer support and I was told that the hard disk was damaged (I lost all files on the disk). I was told that I have to buy a new hard disk somewhere on myself. And then Acer can send me a copy of Windows 10 on flash drive to rebuild the system, but I need to pay $99.00. In this case other brand normally provide a flash drive or download link for free. So I decided to give up Acer and go to find another brand.","I was thrilled to receive this laptop. My three-year-old had recently decided it was a good idea to pour water into my old HP laptop. I do a lot of crafting using my Silhouette and Cricut. My main use for my laptop is, using my vinyl cutting machines, using graphic design software, surfing the internet, and basic word processing. I had found that when using my old laptop, that the program I would use for designing would constantly crash. I honestly figured it was just bad program design, and not my computer. I was shocked find how well everything ran when I was using this laptop. For a budget laptop its processing speed is excellent.  I also love how lightweight it is. It really only feels slightly heavier than a Chromebook. Another nice thing about this laptop is, please set up. It is all voice activated. You are easily walked through it using either voice prompts or the mouse. I would say that the total setup took around five minutes.  The other thing that I have thoroughly tested on this laptop is, the Bluetooth. I have connected my printer, and two vinyl cutting machines to it, with no issues. Overall, this is a great budget laptop. For my uses, I have honestly found no limitations. Now I just need to keep my toddler away from it....","The screen on this laptop is nice but it is kind of hard to open. It is hard to catch an the edge. When it is closed the edges are flush and it\u2019s hard to get a finger in to open it. Not the end of the world, but kind of a pain when you are in a hurry.  It is very light. The side is super thin which is great for taking back and forth to work. The screen though is an awesome size. The plastic does not feel cheap and does feel solid. The outside is aluminum so I feel like it should hold up. Although, not technically as fast of a processer as some I am not noticing any drag. I don\u2019t do any gaming or crazy streaming though. I mainly use it for work purposes so: office products and adobe ect. Not a ton of memory but not planning on using this lap top for my photos. Overall for the price this is a great laptop! Great for basic work or first time laptop owner like college student.","I was looking for a Windows laptop that I could use for work and photo editing that wouldn't cost an arm and a leg. Not too much to ask for, right? The Acer Aspire 5 fit the bill. Thanks to a SSD, the full HD 15 inch display, 4GM memory and a whopping 9 hour battery life, I can get the work done that I need to do without wasting a ton of money. I have several other computers - mostly Apple computers - so the slim, modern design (reminiscent of an iPad pro) appealed to me. The solid state drive means the laptop can take a smack without crashing and it starts up super quick. Unlike SOME computers I could mention (ah hem, Apple), this computer as oodles of ports. An ethernet port, two standard USB ports, a USB C port, an HDMI port ,and the power port on the left, with another Standard USB port, a headphone jack and a place to connect a lock cable on the right. The display is excellent. No, it doesn't match up to some of the higher-end laptops, but it's very good. I can edit huge files with no trouble and watching video is awesome. The thin bezel around the screen makes the view great. The video chip is nothing to write home about it, but it's pretty good and can certainly handle the basic job. Of course, 4 GB of memory sucks. You can upgrade, and if you are only paying $300 for a laptop, what can you expect? The keyboard is freakin HUGE. It's backlit and the keys are quite separate, which is nice if you have big hands. Actually, I have small hands, and it's great for me, too. The keys have a small gap between them, making it harder to fat finger things. I'm getting about 8 hours of battery life with regular use, which is pretty good, though short of what the manufacturer claims. It takes a chunk of time to charge, but larger batteries tend to do that. Overall, I really can't complain. This is a good laptop at an amazing price. It's worth every penny and then some.","I have had the chance to use two of the more recent Acer Aspire 15.6\" Laptops. This Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop is a good solid computer with a tried and true Intel Core Processor.  It will be likely to will work very well without problems. The other computer I tried is a very similar Acer 15.6\" machine with a AMD Ryza processor which is faster and better for gaming. Both computers were easy to set up with the unit directing you through the process. Battery life is good so far but only  more time will tell. The Acer Aspire 5 is much quicker than my 2 year Dell and has excellent screen clarity. One thing to keep in mind; if you need a disk drive in your computer, it does not have one. The unit is thin relatively light in weight and fits into most backpacks and sleeves. Overall this is a very sound work horse computer that I am very happy to use, at a reasonable price.","This is a lot of computer for this price!  It has a lot of great features like the touch screen. The colors and resolution are good.  It is reasonably fast. It is also pretty light for a bigger screen computer","PROS: Beautiful looking laptop. Aluminum top for looks and protection. The 1080 screen is sharp and clear with good color. Windows 10 S is easy to use. Acer has good support. Easy to set up. Small transformer in line brick. Connectors: 2 USB-3, 1 USB-2, ethernet, 1 USB-C, 1 HDMI Keyboard lights up! Battery life is good so far. Mouse pad is large and responsive. Built-in camera CONS: Poor instructions. Nice Acer laptop. No need to buy the big name brands when an Acer will do the same thing for less money. They are designed to only last a few years at best so why waste the money?","We picked this up to upgrade my mom's computer. She didn't need anything too robust just something quick, relatively light, and reliable and that's exactly what this is. It boots up in a second and does everything she needs it to do: email, light streaming, and basic word processing. This would also be a great laptop for school. I never love all the bloatware that comes with Acer but most of that was easy to remove. I don't care for Microsoft edge and unfortunately it's a pain in the butt to try to remove it so you will have to do a little bit of googling possibly to get around deactivating it installing another browser like chrome if that's what you want. But again this is a really simple computer to set up and I'm glad to know she'll have something reliable for years to come.","So far so good.  I switched it out of S-mode so I could download and install Google Chrome, Photoshop, and a few other applications. Basically,switching out of S-mode means you don't have to ONLY use Microsoft approved products, so it is a no-brainer.  I plan to upgrade the memory in the future, but for now it's great!  Looks good, is very light, love the matte finish screen (not super glossy), and small thin border around the screen.  Great product so far!","Warning! DO NOT buy the Aspire A515-54 laptop! There is no way to stop the lighted keyboard time-out. I will be posting this message everywhere on the internet, until Acer has a fix. What a terrible idea.","Screen seems to have a loose connection and flickers until its in a favorable position","The screen is reasonably bright. Sound quality is satisfactory. The keyboard is okay. Performance is decent and I'm hoping it'll get better with another 4gb of ram. Probably the one of the best, if not the best $350 laptop on Amazon.","I ordered this PC for my daughter and it was a major disappointment.  Maybe I was expecting too much from a $400 PC?  We sent it back.","It work on european station with 220v???","Excelente port\u00e1til, llego muy bien sellado y en perfectas condiciones.","I've been using the predecessor to this model, the Acer Aspire E5-575-33BM, for well over a year now and it has served me well.  The 1 TB HDD that it came with was terrible, but after an easy upgrade that laptop has been quick and reliable. So when I saw this new model, the A515-54-30BQ, I was very confident getting it, even though the specs seem rather modest.  This is a great looking laptop, with a nice brushed aluminum top, a backlit keyboard, and a bright 1080P display.  The 2 USB 3.1 ports and a USB C port are very nice, but I really wish there was a card reader.  It comes with 4 GB of RAM, 128GB of storage and Windows 10 in S mode.  Right out of the box, it fired up quickly and worked very well.  I'd never heard of Windows 10 S Mode, but a quick search revealed that it seems to be Microsoft's answer to the Chrome operating system.  It's a limited version of the underlying Windows OS designed to run faster, give better battery life, and provide better security.  You are limited to using the Edge browser and can only load apps from the Microsoft Store.  It's not a bad option if you use Microsoft Office 365 and OneDrive.  You can easily switch to Windows 10 Home or Pro if you're not comfortable with those limitations, but once you do there is no going back.  The Windows support page titled \"Switching out of S mode in Windows 10\" shows you how to do it for free. Knowing that I was going to be making that switch, the first thing I did was add RAM and storage.  The operating system is installed on the 128 GB NVMe SSD, so I just went the easy route of adding an additional SSD.  Acer support has published a video of the procedure on YouTube titled, \"Aspire A515-54 How to Install an Additional Hard Drive.\"  I've included pictures of the process, but you should really watch the video.  While you're in there, you might want to add some RAM.  There is 4 GB soldered to the motherboard, so whatever you plug in will be added to that.  I was able to get an additional 4 GB for less than $20. This just goes to show that the best thing about this laptop is its versatility.  Out of the box, it's a great Chromebook alternative.  The CPU, an Intel i3-8145u, is a 2 core 4 thread processor with a boost frequency of 3.90 MHz that easily beats the processors you will find in comparably priced alternatives.  For just a little more (I spent about $75 for my upgrades), you can convert it to a full-fledged Windows laptop.  I wouldn't call it a desktop replacement, but it's thin and light, easily portable, and it works great for me!","The Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop is aimed at the casual user \/ student who needs a little bit more power than the average tablet or bare bones, internet only laptop. There is plenty of power here and more for running Microsoft Office applications (word, Excel, Power Point, etc.) The backlit keyboard is a very nice feature for taking notes during a lecture in a darkened room and the keys are quiet, roomy, and have a slightly rubberized feel. Thanks to the 15\" screen there is also room for a 10-key numeric keypad on the right side. The 15\" HD screen is a treat considering other laptops are being sold with 13\" screens for much more. It's perfect for streaming movies, TV shows. The sound from the laptop is surprisingly  crisp, clear, and full. As full as you can get with a laptop speaker in this price range. The photos show the included ports which should be fine for most applications. Other than the power cord feeling a little wiggly when plugged in to charge, the unit feels very solid. (Technical Note: The laptop is shipped in Windows 10 S Mode which, for security improvement, only allows the user to install applications from the Windows Store. The option to opt out of Windows S Mode is provided as a one time switch out - photos shown above.)"],"26":["For the price, this is a great Chromebook. It checks a lot of boxes and I've done my fair share of research. 1. Solid build. Nice sturdy plastic chassis. (Keeps it lightweight) 2. USB type C port, SD card slot, HDMI, and USB 3.0 3. Touchscreen with an IPS display 4. 4 gigs of RAM and 64gig of storage. (rare at this price point) 5. Nice feel to the keyboard and track pad. 6. ARM processor that is optimized for the Google play store apps and runs much better than the Intel celerons you see in most low-end Chromebooks. You get a lot for $300. You can't really find those options within that price range. The only thing I wish it had was a FHD display. 1366x768 still looks sharp on an 11.6 in screen but it would be super sharp if it was 1080p. I would highly recommend this Chromebook.","Full disclosure, I am not an IT professional but use laptops, tablets, and desktop computers daily in my personal and work life. This chromebook has far exceeded my expectations. This is my first time using a chromebook. I have had a week or so to really dig into the device. I own an alienware gaming laptop, but I find myself only using it now for gaming purposes only. This chromebook is fast in my opinion. The speed is snappy and the device responds quickly to gestures and commands. I have yet to find sometime I can't do on this that I do on my windows laptop aside from gaming. One game I like to play requires windows, mac, or linux. Since this has an ARM processor it does not support linux applications at this time. Design: This device is a bright attractive white chromebook. I find the design to be pleasing to the eye and appears sturdy even though it is made from plastic. I do not particularly like using it in tablet mode. The screen feels bulky and sometimes unmanageable in tablet mode. The screen quickly transitions to whatever position to place it in whether laptop, tent, or tablet mode. I personal find myself not even using my LG tablet for much of anything except when I need LTE internet away from home. Overall the design is great. Screen\/Input: I find the keyboard to be on par with most laptop keyboards. The keys are a little shallow and I feel my typing has slowed a little bit, but not by much. The IPS touchscreen is very responsive and rarely find myself having to touch the screen more than once for my intended gesture. Screen is bright in home conditions, but feel it would lack in more intense lighting situations, such as outdoors. Ease of Use: The google play store makes this thing be able to do just about anything. I have not tried any intense applications. I use chrome, netflix, hulu, evernote, several banking apps, and various other apps. All of them are snappy responsive. The bank apps load like they are in phone mode, thus they are in a small window. The apps still work as designed. Netflix and Hulu playback is smooth and pleasant to watch on the screen. Overall, I am impressed with the Google OS and this device in general. If your someone who is on the fence about the operating system, I suggest you give it a try. The battery life is good as well. When using my gaming laptop its always with a cord tethered nearby. I also understand a gaming laptop is far more power intensive. I have yet to use this chromebook while charging it. The battery has allowed me to watch 4-5 hours of netflix, talk on facebook, and text through my phone without ever getting critically low. I charge it at night and then never put it back on till the next night. This is a max screen brightness. I was also very surprised with the speakers. The speakers were much louder and not distorted. I honestly expected them to be cheap netbook quality that is mostly better just to never use them, but thats not the case with this chromebook. I do generally use a bluetooth headset. The bluetooth headset paired with extreme simplicity. I also set up my brother wireless laser printer with google cloud print in less than 30 seconds. Google did it right and lenovo delivered a solid product. I did purchase this on sale for $200 but would have spent the $300. If your a web surfer, music listener, netflix watcher I highly recommend this. If you need windows intense software then go with windows. Otherwise I think you'll find yourself using this as your primary device as I have.","Brand new device, went from 64gb out the box and after the OS update i only have 49GB available. 3.7G are in use by preinstalled apps. So you can subtract at least 15GB from the advertised 64GB description. That said, if you buy the 32GB you'll be severely disappointed.","Over the period of 30-60 seconds after unboxing it for the first time. 1. Turn on 2. Sign in with your Google account. 3. Select wifi network. That's it, everything is set up, all your Google pictures, mail, bookmarks (from your Android phone, assuming you use chrome on mobile) is all there. I'm used to spending at least a few hours setting up, updating, uninstalling bloatware, denying \"trial offers\" on Windows PCs. Nothing on this. Literally ready for use within a minute. Windows\u00ae, take notes.","Do NOT buy this if you will need to download apps as the Google Play Store app can\u2019t be downloaded on this chrome book. Internet and everything else works fine, but I bought this for my kids to play Roblox and other apps, but this particular chrome book won\u2019t allow the Google Play store. I had no idea that it was even possible for the Google App Store not to be compatible with a Google Chrome Book!","Chromebook prices range from around $100 to over $1000. Better Chromebooks have Intel Core CPUs for great performance. The much cheaper Mediatek system in this Chromebook gives it mediocre performance, especially for intensive games or for business users who open lots of tabs simultaneously and frequently switch between them. On the plus side this Chromebook has a useful 4GB of RAM, a sharp colorful IPS screen, a touch screen that works great with Android apps, a very responsive (for swiping) touchpad, and reliable WiFi (much better than my HP laptop). On the minus side, the white plastic shell looks and feels a little cheap, the screen is not very bright, and the touchpad's button feels a little clunky. In summary, if you can't afford more than $300, this is a good choice for casual users who only have a few tabs open at once and use it mostly for email, Facebook, web surfing, and streaming music or videos. If you can afford $350 to $400, you will have several choices with more powerful CPUs for more intensive users.","I am extremely impressed with this unit. Great price, and it works really well. Nicely designed, sturdy, the keyboard and trackpad are decent. Touchscreen works well. I would highly recommend it. One thing is incorrectly described in the specifications - it says there is a microSD card slot. It is actually a SD slot. I bought a microSD card hoping to put it in and have added storage space on the go, but an SD card sticks out a lot.","I've owned several chrome books in the past 5 years, and can say that none came close to this in term of features and versatility. Of course the display could be better but for what you use it for 95% of the time, 1366 x 768 is more than adequate. Videos are sharp and clear, document display clearly and crisp and texts are sharp on the screen. You can operate this in all different ways; as a laptop, flat tablet or tent mode to watch your favorite movies. Touch screen is very responsive, I kept forgetting it's a laptop! One gripe however, the SD card slot is shallow; put a SD card in the it sticks out more than half the length. So you wouldn't want to leave the card in; must remove it after use. Of course, you know the benefits of a Chrome book. Light weight (in many ways, both software and hardware), no need for tedious OS upgrade, no worries about viruses while providing everything a computer user needs. If you are a Netflix subscriber, there is no download option however so you couldn't take a movie to watch on the plane ride. Regardless of these limitations, I still love this chrome book and it would definitely with me on trip from now on.","I am a big fan of Chromebooks. They update themselves, can now run at least some Google apps.  They are portable, cheap enough to haul where ever you go and fit one both airplane trays and the teeny desks they give students at college.  This one is a good value at the price for everyday use as long as you are not a demanding gamer. Pros: Price. Touchscreen.  Nice at this price point! Lots of connections SB-C 3.0 port USB-A 3.0 port, a full-size HDMI connection and a DisplayPort port a full-size SD card reader, combo audio jack.  There is NO Thunderbold 3port. Keyboard is excellent for the size.  Nice rebound to the keys. Folds so watching videos is easier.  And when you fold it the speakers are then behind the screen, which gives reasonable sound for this small of a device. Battery lasted 10 (surfing internet mainly) hours, 11 hours (mostly playing videos) and 10.5 (combo of tasks) hours in three trials.  This is a long time.  You can get through an entire day with this.  Screen was at between 50 and 70 percent brightness for these tests, higher brightness will drain it faster. Will run Google apps that are available (not all google apps are available for chromebooks) Lots of storage at 64GB for a Chromebook. You can add more with the SD slot. Has Bluetooth, so you can use your headphone to get a better audio experience. Cons: The bezel is too large for the size (see photo).  The resolution is not great at 1,366 x 768 (140 PPI).  We have all become a little spoiled with the clarity of phones, this is noticeably lower.  It has a refresh rate of 60Hz so it is fine for catching a little Netflix, but do not expect high def quality. No backlighting on the keyboard. No number pad. Its too slow for intense gaming.  You will not be playing any high demand games on this, it lags.  Fine for browsing the internet and word processing, low graphics demand games and other such tasks.","Absolutely love this laptop. I purchased this for my 8 yr old daughter. She loves Roblox and other games and is able to download them and play on it. Size is not too big, easy to use, and I bought the colored case and keyboard cover and it's super cute. Excellent for the price point.","Let me start off with: This is the second one of these I have had. I had to return the first one I bought, because there was a problem with the sleep and the bluetooth. Sleep, because when I would close the lid, it would just power off the device, rather than putting it in suspension. Bluetooth, because when connected to a bluetooth mouse for anywhere between 5 to 30 minutes, it will bug out and refuse to work again until it's rebooted. Now, I had thought that the problems might be related, and since it was a hardware issue, the replacement would be free of both problems. However, I was wrong, unfortunately. It seems the bluetooth issue is just what the device does. It's a bit disappointing, as my Moto X Pure Edition (which was the first Moto X made by Motorola after being purchased by Lenovo) had nearly this very same issue with its bluetooth. It makes me draw the conclusion that Lenovo makes poor decisions when they choose who they use for bluetooth radios. That aside, everything else about this Chromebook is fairly surprising. It's snappy, sounds good, looks good, works well. It's a lot better than it has any right to be at the price point they have it at. I am, again, disappointed that their cost saving measures had them put in a faulty bluetooth radio in them, but I will find a way. I work from this thing, so I can't be without it again, and I am not rollin' in the dough, so beggars and choosers and all that. If bluetooth isn't a huge need, this is the ticket. If bluetooth is a big deal, you might want to invest in a more expensive chromebook from someone like ASUS, who uses great hardware.","If I'd written this review right after I received my Chromebook I would have said it's a great little computer for the money.  Unfortunately, it suddenly stopped working after 42 days. Amazon tech support and Lenovo tech support walked me through a few fixes to try, but ultimately the screen just wouldn't turn on. Of course, the standard Amazon return period for this machine is 30 days, and Lenovo does not offer any warranty for machines sold by re-sellers (including Amazon). I found this out after Amazon transferred me over to Lenovo. Lenovo transferred me again, disconnected me and ultimately made me try the same fixes again before sharing the details of this delightful policy. Ultimately my Amazon Tech requested an exception, and I was allowed to return the machine.  That said, I'm not going to buy another one and risk having another lemon of a machine that essentially doesn't have a warranty. I'm going back to buying Macs + Applecare.  You get what you pay for.","Before I share my thoughts on the product I would like to preface with a disclaimer that I am an educator who has used Chromebooks as a tool for teaching and for my own work projects. I LOVE this Chromebook and feel fortunate to have above a basic understanidng of how Chromebooks work.  First, it came with a Lenovo box packaged in an amazon box. No problems opening the packages or initiating start up with the Chromebook.  The winter white case is plastic and may require extra care.  However, it does NOT look or feel cheap as noted by other customers.  Also, because I noted the complaints with regard to speed associated with memory, I did purchase the larger 4 gb RAM and 64 gb memory with a SSD.  I really think this is a gamechanger and will be utilizing this Chromebook for online classes and anything else I may need to do online.  I have already been able to utilize commonly accessed apps for my cell phone on my Chromebook!  No problems with anything thus far.  I will update. Today is 4\/16\/19 and I am still enjoying my Chromebook.  A couple things that have come up with regard to the laptop keyboard: the keys can pop off if snagged.  The keys have popped or snapped on easily when I noticed they were gone. It is nice that the keys don't actually break off.  I have noticed that some apps still don't work on Chromebooks, however there are extensions to improve access.","I only had a few days to use this before I discovered a flaw I thought was just a feature of the device, was actually a hardware defect. When you close the lid, it is supposed to sleep. Suspend. Instead, mine would shut down completely, logging me out and erasing any of my unsaved work in my apps. I use this for work, I can have that. However, I learned, having done a bunch of reading to figure this out, that this item page isn't the default item listing for the Lenovo C330 (this), so when I had to return the defective unit, I reordered my replacement through the Amazon listing itself. Theirs is 64gb, and the same price as this. That aside, I am blown away at how amazing this Chromebook is. It is so much better than it has any right to be at this price point. It's closest competition is a $474 ASUS. 2-n-1 Touchscreen at $240 is remarkably cheaper than the other options, so I very much assumed I would get what I paid for. But I got a much more valuable device for a heck of a lot less than I should have. It's quick, the speakers, while are not optimally placed for laptop mode, are the loudest (and still clear) speakers on any portable computer I've ever used (including laptops, tablets, and smartphones). It boots fast, it is kept up to date with the newest Chrome OS features, including being one of the few to get the formerly Pixel book exclusives like Google Play and Instant Tether. Linux apps are inbound as well. If you are needing a device that's fast, versatile, and affordable, go no further. But search around Amazon for the best possible deal. I'm going to be doing a much more thorough review on Amazon's official item page once my new replacement shows up.","We just opened this today and so far I am very pleased. It was purchased for a student who has a chromebook at school so she was using it immediately and very thrilled to have it. The Amazon description doesn't have a model number but the paperwork says it is a C330. I'm thinking it's a newer version of the model since the description says it came out in November 2018 and there aren't any reviews yet. The C330 model 81HY0000US is listed as being released on Aug 2018 and I read those reviews before purchasing. I took a chance getting something without a review because it had a similar description to the C330 and it was able to arrive within 2 days. The white color is very nice, the weight is nice and it seems sturdy. There were remarks on the C330 reviews about settling for a resolution that wasn't as good as others, but I think the graphics are just fine. The keyboard has a nice touch and it has many features I was looking for - a touch screen; blue tooth; and being able to fold it to use as a tablet. Bonus: it sits in other positions for easy movie viewing; HDMI; USB slots, SD slot; camera, etc... I know you can get a more basic Chromebook for $150 - $200 but it was work paying $250 to get all of these extra features. I just can't see getting one without a touch screen. I don't know if the 32 GB instead of 64 GB is going to be an issue. We haven't tried to load any apps yet.","Just got this after having an old Macbook Air for many years and I'm blown away. Great keyboard, touch screen works well, most websites load quickly enough and tablet mode is good for watching videos. Android apps run smoothly too, which is fun to explore if you're coming from Planet Apple. Highly recommended","If your needs are browsing the web, checking email, watching Netflix, there's no reason to spend any more money than what the cost of this is. Downloads and runs apps from the Google Play store super well. Keyboard is great, touchpad is lightyears better than I expected it to be with multi-touch functionality. Unless I need to run a professional software like Photoshop, I don't think I'll be using any other device on the go\/around the house. Pretty lightweight, fits in a bag easily, although it's a plastic shell it seems pretty durable. This little device has far exceeded my expectations.","I'm on the second week now of using the Lenovo C330 convertible Chromebook (there are multiple models on the site under C330 so I'm specifying it is the model with 4GB RAM, 64GB SSD,  MediaTek MT8173C processor). I needed to replace my 9 year old Macbook Pro that was an excellent machine but just couldn't handle modern computing needs. However, I have a desktop for more intense computing needs, so I really didn't want to spend $1000+ on a new MacBook to browse the web, watch YouTube videos, read eBooks, watch Netflix etc in the evening. Cheap laptops in the sub $350 range are frankly almost all junk, so I wasn't really interested in buying one of those either. I don't want a tablet because I want a keyboard and I like to lie flat in bed and that's just not convenient. Enter the Chromebook! So far, this has been an impressive solution for the purchase price of $231. Of course, Chromebooks have a variety of hardware and you need to do your homework to get the best experience. For about $50 more than lesser Chrombooks, this is an ideal middle ground solution. Within its comparable price range, the MediaTek MT8173C processor scores at the top as far as processing speed. Coupled with 4GB DDR3 RAM and a 64 GB SSD for boot speed, plus how lightweight of an OS ChromeOS is, this is a very well performing little machine for the price. Web browsing is snappy, YouTube loads very quickly and the Google Play store gives you access to all the apps you need. So far, all apps have loaded without any issues and function well. The battery life is remarkable - I've gotten 13-14 hours of use from it and still had 15% when I finally plugged it in. ChromeOS is super easy to learn\/user friendly and reminds me of the user experience of a phone\/tablet. NOW - this machine is not a few things. It doesn't have a super high resolution screen, but it's a small screen, so it's not bad, but if you're used to a Retina screen it will be a bit lower in quality. It is fine and perfectly functional, but not exceptional, as a tablet (not the best touch screen response and obviously heavier than normal tablets and ChromeOS isn't as optimized for touch screen use compared to phone\/tablet operating systems - think things like bigger front\/back\/X buttons - those aren't as prevalent on ChromeOS). The keypad is nice and sensitive but the click is loud. Printing is probably a pain but I have a desktop for that, so I don't care. So far, those are really the only cons I have found to this machine, but the pros far outweigh and you need to be realistic about features vs. price. It does a lot of things really well at the current list price of $251. It is not a $1000 laptop and you simply can't expect $1000 features from it. I'm very glad I spent the extra money for this over the sub-$200 Chromebooks with lower quality hardware and no convertible\/touch screens. The convertible\/touch really makes it fun to use. So, in summary: If you just need a machine to do run of the mill browsing, streaming, etc I think this is an almost perfect solution and an excellent value for the money.","I got my device for $200 (normal $300) on Black Friday. It has nice touchscreen, keyboard, touchpad, and type-C, USB 3.0, HDMI, blue-tooth, audio jack. Screen resolution is low but you cannot expect too much for a $200 device. A lot of Google play store apps are not compatible, and you cannot install other source apps because that feature is disabled. It runs not as fast as my smartphone but is acceptable. I only recommend it for web surfing and entertainment usage.","My Kindle Fire 10 HD response is very slow and it needs charging at least once per day. I snatched up this Chromebook when it went on sale. I like alternative (non-Microsoft) OS's. I currently use Ubuntu for my desktop. My first impressions of this Chromebook is positive. Kindle reading app works just fine. Although I don't have issues using Google Chrome browser for social media I have not had any issues with the FB Twitter or Instagram apps. I've been using this Chromebook off and on for more than a day. The battery is currently at 49% off of yesterday's charge. Although I've installed very little with no immediate intentions of installing anything else I currently have 47GB of free space left. It's small enough, and I like how I can choose between tablet to laptop. The speakers sounds better than previous laptops that I've had. It feels pretty fast (because of lack of hard drive) and responds well on my 5G wifi network. All in all I like this little thing.","I  received my Lenovo Chromebook C330 and was setting it up.  I went into  settings to turn on Google play and it  wouldn't turn on.  It stated  that the administrator would not  let me have access to Google play store.  I researched online and there was little to know advice and didn't seem like a common issue.  I contacted Lenovo chat which only gave me a number and told me to press option 3.  It only had an option for 1 or 2, so I should have known how it would go.  I was  transferred multiple times, told it was a google issue, google told me it was a Lenovo issue and back and forth I  went.  So, I have returned it to Amazon and I am warning people to stay away.  I am not one to write reviews,  so know that I am extremely unhappy with this product and Lenovo's product support.","Regarding Chrome OS.  This is my first chromebook so I'm still learning, but so far I'm extremely impressed!  It seems like the chromebook was the computer I've always needed but never realized I wanted!  Marrying the pc experience to an android compatible operating system is magical.  Although I'm apprehensive about this browser-based computing, I've found it very easy to save and edit documents offline so I'm still able to work on the go.  I can also connect it to my android phone, send and receive text messages with it, emulate old school video games, connect it to my bluetooth speakers and blast some jams.  I regret not making Chrome OS a part of my life MUCH sooner! Regarding performance.  I've heard people say this processor is mediocre.  I have to ask, what are those people even doing to arrive at the conclusion?!  I have not once seen the slightest indication that this thing isn't *completely* competent for daily needs.  Incredible response time.  No lag when scrolling.  Minimal to no delay opening apps.  Stunningly fast start up time.  I feel like it's a pretty outstanding performer, overall.  Really, what more could you ask for? Regarding the build quality.  It's a bit bulky in its \"tablet\" mode and lacks the premium build materials of high end chromebooks, but it still looks and feels great, certainly better than any laptop PC I've ever owned!  The white color is gorgeous.  The size is perfect.  The keyboard is comfortable and the touch pad is large and responsive.  If you look closely you'll see Lenovo coated the touch pad with a hefty clear coat to prevent wear and tear.  As someone who immediately coats touch pads with contact paper to prevent damage, this is an impressive step, however inconspicuous to the average user.  Additionally the hinge feels solid and smooth.  The construction of the entire build just feels extremely sturdy.  The monitor produces extremely sharp images with outstanding color.  Although many people express dissatisfaction with the lack of 1080p and the larger bezels framing the monitor, I didn't even notice!  (Side note: If bezels really concern you, consider the experience of flipping this into tablet mode and walking around with it while working.  Wider bezels in this situation result in fewer accidental screen taps from fingers that are curled around the edges holding it.) I absolutely recommend this chromebook.  It's a steal at this price point, and stands to replace my quad core, 8gb Windows 10 laptop for most of my computing needs.  Sure, it's not a 1080p monitor, lacks a backlit keyboard, and isn't made out of aluminum, but goodness gracious if isn't the coolest, most practical little laptop I've ever owned. It was even featured as one of the best chromebooks money can buy as of Feb 2019 by Android Police and Android Authority!!","I\u2019m definitely liking my Chromebook! I\u2019m an amateur because my main computers have been my IPhone and IPad mini for many years and I finally decided to add a computer to my collection! It\u2019s a great beginners computer that\u2019s lightweight but durable! The picture and graphics aren\u2019t great, but, ok for the work I need to get done! I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to gamers or photographers or people looking to watch videos clearly!","After using it for an hour the mouse will start moving around erratically.  It will disappear from the screen and start randomly clicking and zooming in.  Not sure what's causing it.  I googled for help and there is nothing out there for chromebook help.  I've tried resetting.  That helped for a couple days. This all sucks because I really like this chromebook when it is actually working correctly.","Great little computer for the price. This model is slightly older than the newest, so it utilizes the Play Store. This is convenient for the most part, but I have run into a couple apps that don't run right. The good part about it using the Play Store is that I can still download the various Microsoft Office programs, rather than having to add them to the browser. It is very fast. A PC with 4gb ram is not going to move as quickly as this little guy. It responds as quickly when opening programs as my 8gb pc laptop. I love it because it is small and light. It fits right into any bags I bring with me to school. It also is a touchscreen and can be used as a tablet. It should be the only laptop I need for nursing school. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a quick little, extremely transportable, computer for browsing or homework.","I had been 'window' shopping for a chromebook for a while. I read all the information about this chromebook, the reviews from consumers across multiple vendors  and I have to say, the reviews...live up to the hype. This chromebook is amazing. The speed of the connection, the ease of use, the functionality of it and the overall design is wonderful. Because it is Google....there is a sense of trust that comes with using it. Connection to the Google Drive makes things so much easier for me since I already used it for everything anyway. The Google Office system is fabulous so I love that I have it already installed on the chromebook. I have to be honest, I'm so very happy with this purchase.","I bought this for my wife as her old Chromebook had seen better days, Performance wise its great. It is a Chromebook so its all relative but for what she uses it for it performs flawlessly. The touch screen is responsive and easy to use. Screen is bright and google play apps (which is a big plus as Chromebook specific apps are limited and frankly poorly ported) appear to perform just as well as on her Pixel 2. The only complaint really is compared to her old Chromebook this thing feels like its made of lead. Not a huge deal if on a desk or on your lap, does however give your arms a work out if you are holding it in a tablet configuration. All in all though it is a great buy at $249 and more than any thing she is happy with it, which hell lets be honest is more important than anything.","I bought this to take on a backpacking trip to Europe because I also need to do some work. I was looking for a small, lightweight machine that could access the internet and get my work done. This little machine exceeds my expectations. Solidly constructed, great keyboard, fast, display clarity. And a touchpad that works properly. I have a loathing for touchpads so the fact that I\u2019ve been using this one all day for work and haven\u2019t wanted to smash it is a huge plus. I\u2019ll report back after the backpacking trip to let you know how it fared in the elements. I may have to get one for my dad.","The first week everything worked GREAT!!!! Then the second week everything started going wrong.  I had to uninstall and reset more than 5 times, it kept freezing and the camera stopped working.","Very disappointed with this product and Amazon. Replaced my previous Chromebook in December. Now it is the end of March and the new one is not functioning.  It is not registering keystrokes - takes about 3 minutes to register the second letter of my password to log in. Contacted Amazon and they said the warranty has expired. A very nice customer rep set up a conference call with the manufacturer. Two solutions were given to me. 1) Mail it back for $85, wait and pay for the repair. Or take it to a shop for repair and an unknown amount. What a load of you know what. They should take it back for free and give me a new one. Very dissatisfied with this interaction iht Amazon and Lenovo. Plus this has taken me twice as long to write bc it fails to recognize every 4th keystroke.","The prose is keep changing witch is annoying","Thought this was an out of the box ready to go item. Just enter Gmail account and go. But the Chrome OS is a little funky. Tried putting on Google Assist and small notification windows came up, but another window always came up on top, so you can't read what the heck the first notification is. Never could get Assist to run and the online instructions did not help at all. I'm tech savvy, but gong to the \"dark side\" of the OS to get Canary and tweaking things is not easy functionality that was promised. Think I'll just get a google home hub. Sorry guys.","What a wonderful computer! Like the other reviewer said: unbox, turn it on, connect wifi, sign into your Google account. That's it! It's like a slightly larger tablet (11\" vs 10\"). Substantial without being heavy. I did not experience wrist fatigue. The touch screen is very responsive, and it's easy to switch to the keyboard. All the extensions you're accustomed to using with the chrome browser on your PC, are available on this Chromebook, with the addition of the same apps you use on your phone from the Google Play Store. This Chromebook is lightening fast. What's not to like? As I found out, there are limitations (unfortunately). Chrome OS is not compatible with Adobe products. Nor can it run programs written in Python. The other substantial limitation is that it wouldn't work with my older Brother printer\/scanner, which I love. These three limitations ended up being a deal killer for me. I was forced to return this great little Chromebook. \ud83d\ude1e I use the ebook library management program called Calibre (written in Python) in conjunction with Adobe Digital Editions to download and store library books. I cannot imagine life without without access to my books. And there is no acceptable solution available for Chromebook at the time of this review. The purchase of this Chromebook was intended to be my only computer, so their was no alternative. So a deal killer. As far as the printer goes: my Brother wireless laser printer\/scanner is about ten years old. It works perfectly. And it's the printer of my dreams. There's no reason to replace it. It couldn't be installed on the Chromebook, and it wasn't Google Cloud compatible. Deal breaker. \ud83d\ude15 So as long as you don't have these kinds of limitations, go for it! It's a great little Chromebook computer! Unfortunately, I was forced to return it in favor of a Windows based PC.","Firstly, my first observation is that I ordered this Chromebook from Amazon around midnight on Tuesday night and it showed up on my front porch shortly after noon on Wednesday (The next day !).  Essentially same day delivery.  Can't beat that ! This is my very first non-Microsoft (DOS) computer, so I am learning the new system and after many years, it is somewhat of a struggle.  Not that I am new to computers as I started out on TRSDOS (Tandy-Radio Shack Operating System) machines and was a systems manager for several years for our company.  Things are so much simpler now as all I got with this laptop was a single page of instructions whereas with the old ones I use to receive two large ring binders packed full of instructions. This little machine is very quick, boots up in seconds, battery life is almost unbelievable and tells me when I have misspelled something.  The file structure is not as visible as I would like, but I am getting used to that.  Programs are different  Since I bought this to replace my laptop for web browsing and emails, it is just about perfect for that. I won't be trying to do AutoCad on it.","When they first came out, I was a strong critic of Chromebooks.  To me, a Chromebook was nothing more than an ADM-3A incarnate; connected to the cloud, instead of a mainframe.  But as Chromebooks started adding Chrome OS, Android and now Linux; I decided that I should get one, to carry around with me on trips; that did not require me to have access to a Windows Pro system. The hardest decision I had to make about this particular purchase, was if I should get the 64gb \"Amazon's Choice\" unit that was actually being sold by Lenovo; or a more expensive 32gb unit sold by other sellers, because their product titles included the words \"Newest 2019.\"  Rest assured, when my 64gb unit arrived, the \"Manufactured\" date on the box was only 2 weeks old. While you are waiting for your order to arrive; it helps to pre-create a Google account, just for the Chromebook.  You can setup & customize a Chrome profile exclusively for use by the Chromebook; and then \"Add\" your other Google accounts to that Chrome profile.  This will speed things up when your Chromebook arrives, because you can just log into that Google account & Chrome profile; and your Chromebook is ready to go.  The advantage of this, besides setup speed, is that you won't clutter your Chromebook's login screen with more than one account choice. Be sure to update your version of Chrome OS.  As of the late March 2019 manufacturing run, version 70 comes installed.  You need at least version 72, if you expect to run Linux, from the get-go. For right now, the only thing that really surprised me about the unit, which may or may not be a \"standard Chromebook thing,\" is that I have (until now) never seen a physical keyboard that was labeled with lower case letters on it!  Speaking of the keyboard, for those who are wondering, the keyboard is disabled after the hinge goes beyond 180 degrees.  It does feel \"weird\" however, to feel the keyboard pressing against your fingers or lap, when using the Chromebook in tablet mode. ********** 2019-04-27 Update ********** Because the display side of the clamshell is so lightweight; when used in \"laptop mode,\" it is very sensitive to motion transfer, and may show signs of noticeable vibration.","big problem with getting this machine fixed. We received this machine with a bad USB port-I got a hold of Lenovo-so they want me to pay to send this brand new machine back to them for repair. It is a new machine-it should not have had this problem. it is not like there is another usb port that can be used instead-ther is only 1 usb port and it is crap-just too loose to use. Too wobbly. does not work when you try to plug in a usb I do not recommend this machine. Carol","It just arrived today and the set up could not have been simpler.  The overall design and product is lightweight and durable.  I had a MacBook that it is about 6-7 years old.  It is starting to get slow and it has been a bit too heavy for travel.  I did not want to spend $1300++ on a new one but wanted to have a smallish lap top to travel with, every now and then I need the Internet and a Keyboard when traveling.  Also own an Ipad Air which has been great but for some business correspondence and work tasks, not ideal (i.e. sending lengthier emails, payroll,  work schedules, etc)  This Chromebook is just what I needed and the price was more than reasonable.  I would highly recommend it for someone needing more than an Ipad but not as much as a MacBook.  It also recognized all of my accounts without having to jump through hoops....So glad I found this on Amazon!  And such a great price!","There was newspaper in the box a charger  and q book nothing else !!!! They are not responding to me! I am so upset. This is so much money to me. I was really looking forward to this.","I'm a developer who needs their machine to pull a lot of weight.  Now, these Chromebooks AREN'T made for this kind of work, so I wouldn't grade it on that.  Basically, I just needed this machine to work as a gateway to my remote machines, and for that, this worked perfectly.  It's light, quick, and simply get's the job done.  If you can keep your work limited to stuff you can do in Chrome (and *some* Android native apps), then this particular machine should be able to get the job done. With that being said, my machine had issues with Bluetooth that I simply couldn't ignore.  Normally, I don't utilize bluetooth very often, but due to the nature of this device and the way I wanted to use it (i.e., highly portable with the 2-in-1 feature), I planned the purchase around it.  The Bluetooth was essentially non-functional.  After looking into it, I found that basically every Chromebook has issues with bluetooth (so it's not necessarily specific to this device), but despite trying everything I could to get the bluetooth even mildly functional (trying beta builds, updating drivers, experimental Bluteooth software, etc.), nothing worked.  Specifically, I could connect to the machine's bluetooth, but after a few minutes, the blueooth would completely cease to work and would only work again after a reboot. After realizing that I wasn't going to be able to fix this problem, I returned the device.  I then bought another 2-in-1 Chromebook that was a little more pricey (I'll try to avoid outright advertising for them, but it was $500 Samsung device, so it cost twice as much).  This device is leagues better. First, the bluetooth actually works.  I still see many of the \"quarks\" that every Chromebook has, but I an actually use the Bluetooth with little issue.  But, that's not the only improvement.  The machine itself is significantly faster, which may not be of much value for most, but certainly improves my experience.  The touchscreen is also drastically superior, allowing for active pen use.  Again, if the \"touchscreen\" portion of these devices aren't that big a deal, then this might not matter, but after using the active pen, I could never go back to a simple touchscreen.  On top of this stuff, the new machine is much lighter and much more comfortable.  I've had people comparing it to an iPad when in tablet mode, which was certainly not the case for the C330. All in all, the C330 is a fine device, but it attempt to be too much of too many things, and doesn't do any of it right.  It's cheap, which is a big plus, but not cheap enough.  It's a 2-in-1, but isn't very good as a tablet.  And it's a Chromebook, but slow and not completely functioning.  I'd suggest either going cheaper and finding a Chromebook that isn't a 2-in-1, or spending the extra money to find a proper 2-in-1.  This just isn't very good as either.","I just got this laptop, I meant it to be used for college work so I signed in with my college email first (becomes the \u201cowner account\u201d). I was disappointed to see that like other comments had said, Google Play Store was nowhere to be found and wouldn\u2019t let me enable it even after fully updating. I had a hunch after reading something about \u201cmanaged accounts\u201d so I went to \u201cPowerwash\u201d aka reset my whole computer, and I happened to see \u201cmanaged by collegename.edu\u201d below Google Play settings, and when I signed in with a different account, boom, I automatically had Google Play Store. This laptop is 100% compatible with the Google Play Store, if you are having issues, sign in with a different Google account that has @gmail\/yahoo\/hotmail on the end and doesn\u2019t have any add-ons like student or edu. Not to say that you cannot still do individual things with your work\/school account, you just cannot have the account set as the \u201cowner\u201d account. I\u2019m so glad I figured this out because this is one of the nicest low end chrome books I\u2019ve ever seen. The screen is beautiful quality and so is the keyboard, the touchpad isn\u2019t bad (but it\u2019s not great, a lot of PCs struggle with this so I think it\u2019s a necessary sacrifice when it is so cheap, but just letting everyone know, the touchpad does stutter and isn\u2019t completely smooth). I think this is a steal for the price so don\u2019t be led astray to think that this doesn\u2019t work with Google Play, it does!","Gift for my husband for Christmas. He loves it. He loves the touch screen and the battery life. Gets the job done!","This was a very nice purchase for me as a Freshman in university. Everything I need to do on a laptop functions within the browser. Web apps are a thing in case you need certain desktop functionalities in a pinch. But I would like to reiterate: think of this as a lightweight device that runs a very optimized and very fast web browser. And I mean that; the browser on this thing can handle as many tabs as I would ever need at once. The OS itself is also smooth and responsive. This thing boots up in 5 seconds flat which is a miracle compared to windows laptops I have used in the past. Something important to note is that storage on this thing... isn't a thing. Well it is, but without a third party file explorer you are going to be using Drive as your main storage. Which is great because I was able to redeem the 100 GB free two year storage with my Chromebook. I recommend using cloud storage with Chrome OS anyway, as it will keep the operating system running quickly and it's just more convenient once you get used to maining it. TL;DR: Great purchase if all you use is the web browser; get used to using Google services (at least Google Drive).","Great inexpensive Chromebook.  Fast, nice keyboard and long battery life. Quick and easy to use for internet, google maps, you tube videos and general use, all make this Lenovo an excellent inexpensive laptop. Exactly what was expected by sixty year old guy anyway. The screen does reflect outside light but so do three other laptops. Speakers are under on either side but are quiet fine for general use, bit muffled at times, same as previous Chromebook, not a real issue. Like nearly all small speakers- limited quality and no real volume. Most annoying, in a minor way, is the slim design takes some careful handling to open since the edge is smooth. The angled front lip provides enough for thumbs to push up to open. Three slight issues to an otherwise great small exactly what was desired laptop. The keyboard is fine, doesn't feel cheap or present any issues when writing hours at a time. Recommend this Lenovo, fourth one, others are pc's, for being good quality long lasting inexpensive laptops. Recommended by a local computer guy, this Lenovo is already the favorite. Anger at windows continual changes and endless updates, even windows 10, justifies using Chromebook. That this Lenovo Chromebook is so quick, easy, fast and inexpensive make it near perfect. Even Google docs is so easy to use. Highly recommend this Lenovo for anyone needing a long lasting, quick easy to use inexpensive laptop with a nice keyboard and, yes a touch screen.","I had an older ACER Chromebook from 6 years ago that needed to be retired due to its limitations (but it was STILL made like a tank!), and I jumped on the opportunity to \"upgrade\" to this Lenovo model. All in all, its a GOOD jump. Just GOOD. Out of the box, its a beautiful clean device. Good weight, nice screen, clean lines all around. After the usual initial setup (which is very easy due to the simplicity of Google), the battery life is definitely longer compared to my old Chromebook. I didn't really clock it but even with multiple tabs running at full brightness and full audio, id say it was about 5 hours before I had to plug in, which sets you up for a good idea on how long it performs when you're frugal with your power usage. Audio was very clear, screen had good resolution and responsive touch feedback (but a fingerprint and smudge magnet!) and does well in the multiple tablet modes while still staying snug. Build-wise is where the issues arise. While light, it is very obvious after long use, plasticky. The keyboard tends to be rather noisy and clicky at at times non-responsive and annoying. There's been times that button presses don't respond at all which FORCED me to switch to the tablet modes and rely on the touch-screen. This is at best, a home Chromebook and not meant for travel and for actual work due to its build limitations. Splurge on extra money and get the higher-end models with better construction and materials if you plan on using this for hard work. UPDATE 3\/15\/19 Buttons DO lose tactile response and I'm NOT a heavy handed guy at all. TOP upper-right keys do not respond 4\/5 times and so do the ASDF column. So to update, the ROWS that control key functions like brightness, backspace, and enter buttons DO NOT WORK. Seriously WTF. DID I GET A REFURBISHED UNIT??? UPDATE 9\/19\/19 Backspace, volume, brightness, MOST letter buttons are TOTALLY non-functioning anymore. Do yourselves a favor and pay more for a more premium build. This is absolutely comical at how bad the build quality isn't this point.","My first Chromebook, but I've owned dozens of laptops, desktops, servers, tablets over a few decades. Going from a large laptop, I needed something for web apps only (email, accounting, documents, etc) and wanted something more than a tablet but less than a full blown laptop, and most important, very good battery life.  So far, I'm very impressed.  Very nice to be able to use the keyboard and touch screen at the same time (faster scrolling, etc).  Very snappy performance, plenty of room, just the right size to be portable yet large enough to be visible for older eyes.  Using for work (self-employed) so I can be in contact no matter where I am, via wifi or bluetooth tethering.  Hoping to get at least three years from it before upgrading to something faster, and it has enough speed that I think that is entirely possible.  The price wasn't my main consideration, although value was, and on that point, I feel like I've done well.","This is a great laptop for its price to be this low, what an out standing chromebook i like it so much its going great so far feels good, the keyboard dosent light up in the background so you can see it during the dark but its an okay good looking keyboard youll just need the light on or the screen very bright to shine the keyboard so you can see it but yea great laptop does what it needs to do and its great handy. Now for the folks that want to download itunes on these laptops...... thats gonna be the disapointment part ... chromebooks dont suppose it and i know google play music is great you can use that but for the users out there for itunes yea it sucks because im one of them i mean i like both itunes and google play music but i perfer itunes better but sadly... :( now hopefully in the future they fix that problem  but yea other than that the laptop itself is great get urself one if ya think ya wanna buy this laptop is cheap and is good, best part is when opening the laptop it turns on already for you without you even turning it on isnt that great!!?! haha but yea gread laptop. XDD","I'm new to Chromebooks but not new to computers. I am an old soul who learned DOS and so I'm most happy with something like Linux and therefore the Chrome OS being based off Linux and the ability for newer Chromebooks to run Linux and open source programs like LIbreOffice are extremely important to me. I recently spilled a whole glass of wine right onto my HP Chromebook 14 therefore I had to buy a new one (even after taking the laptop apart to dry it out). This Lenovo is beautiful. The quality is far greater than the HP piles of junk out there. The screen is magnificent for such a cheap little thing. I like the fact I can use my Logitech Blutooth keyboard and therefore hopefully never spill anything again. That's the beauty of Chromebooks though - everything was backed up online and I didn't really lose much. Picked up where i left off with this wickedly good Lenovo. I have used a lot of machines - including Macs and Dell. I don't feel the price for those things are justified in anyway unless you are a full time graphics dev or designer and need heavy overpriced programs like Photoshop. There are superb alternatives with open source. Inkscape, GIMP, Scribus...and more. Cheap Chromebooks can't do everything but they are getting better all the time. I highly suggest updating Chrome when you buy this laptop, restart it then open settings and turn on Linux Beta. Learn about the programs you can run and how intelligent Linux is at installing them. Overall I love the size of this Chromebook. The screen is clear and gorgeous. Resolution is wonderful. Wish the laptop had more than one standard USB port but I'll manage. (I back up all locally kept files onto a USB drive or sometimes Google Drive). Touchpad seems responsive. The ability to use the laptop as a computer or tablet is fluid and no complaints. Solid build and it looks overall like something way more expensive yet my bank account or credit card isn't bloated because there is a fruit logo on this thing. Very happy with this purchase, would consider buying another one.","I've been enjoying this laptop for a few days now.  The battery life is outstanding.  The keyboard is perfectly adequate with just enough responsiveness.  The touchpad also works well.  The display is adequate.  I've enlarged the default zoom a bit to meet my particular needs.  I wouldn't recommend the display for serious photo editing, but for general web browsing it's perfectly fine.  The interface is about as straight forward as it gets.  It takes very little time to get acquainted with the OS.  As for weight, in laptop mode it's just fine.  In tablet mode, which I rarely use, it's a bit clunky.  I appreciate having a touchscreen, it makes scrolling a lot easier compared to relying on the keyboard only.  The processor speed is adequate for web browsing and so far has been perfectly satisfactory. Given how inexpensive this device is I think it's an outstanding value.","Disclaimer: I'm normally a die-hard Mac person. But I'm also a middle school teacher. And if there are two things that do not go together, it's an expensive personal computer and over 100 twelve to fourteen year-old kids. So I decided now was as good a time as any to use some of my saved-up Amex points to get something that I wouldn't be *that* bothered by if the kids accidentally knocked it off a table or dropped something on it. I mean, they're middle-schoolers so they're not exactly known for their agility and grace. It's fairly no-frills. The box is cardboard. The instruction manual is a folded piece of paper. There's really not much to figure out with a Chromebook and I'd rather pay less for the machine than more for a glossy box and an instruction manual that kills paper and serves no purpose. Right out of the box it booted up nicely. I logged into my Google account and was instantly able to access my email, photos, etc. The touchscreen is nice because sometimes I'm just lazy and don't want to deal with using the trackpad. It was also super-easy to download apps from the Google Play store to use on the Chromebook. Plus, it has an HDMI slot on it so I can hook it up to the board in my classroom and project what I'm looking at to the kids. Is it a high-powered computer that suits the needs for graphics-intensive gaming or serious programs? Absolutely not. Is it worth the price for what you get - a cheap, lightweight Chromebook that's great for a teacher to use for lesson planning, grading (in sheets) and composing quick word documents to be emailed to students, parents, and administrators? Absolutely.","This is a great Chromebook for a student or college student! It\u2019s not too heavy and it\u2019s super easy to setup ! All you need is a gmail account ! Also they battery life on this is amazing , I have had it unplugged all day and I\u2019ve yet to run out of battery ! I would highly recommend it to anyone needing a small computer!  I haven\u2019t run into any problems! They picture quality is pretty good but sometimes some things are kinda pixelated! Overall I would say I love this Chromebook!","This is my third Chromebook and so far it's been the best. Performance is very good in this price range. I have also been getting the advertised battery life and it has been great. The display also seems to be standard with other Chromebooks, but compared to my others (Dell,Asus) the colors display very well. The others had a blue tint to them that was unable to adjust. The only weak spot I have found on this is the hinge itself. If you are one of those people that can tear up and anvil with a rubber hammer then you better tread lightly on this little jewel. Overall, it is a great Chromebook and I would gladly buy again.","So, wow. I can\u2019t find anything wrong with this machine \u2014 fast, responsive, able to run all apps I need\/want, looks good, durable, awesome screen, great battery life, super fast boot, and... amazing price!? Granted this is my first Chromebook, but why have I been buying Windows and Mac laptops all these years?","It was time for new Apple because my 2012 iPad would not upgrade to IOS 11.  I heard the buzz around Chromebooks so I decided to investigate. The reviews for this Lenovo C330 were positive wherever I researched so I purchased from Amazon. It came with 64GB eMMC and 2.1Ghz processor. Same one on Lenovo.com selling for much more came with 64GB eMMC and 1.70Ghz processor !  One would think you would get a better unit from the manufacturer. After days of using this C330 I am so glad I decided to buy the C330 over new iPad. There is so much to like about it. No more spending big bucks for an Apple.","not that it is the computers fault, but I am having much difficulty getting the programs I specifically purchased it for, such as my wired security cameras for remote viewing, if I cannot figure that out because it is a chromebook, doesn't always run windows type programs, I will probably be returning it soon, and going with an i pad or something similar","Only complaint is way too many ads can\u2019t do anything without ads popping up","Overall I cant recommend this chromebook. The price is attractive for what you get but I had 2 before deciding thats  just not enough. The first one when I opened it, it had a super small crack right in the middle of the screen lid, so small that had the case not been white I would have not noticed it. When I did, I attempted to scratch it off with my fingernail thinking it was just a mark, it wasn't and I was honestly ok with it because how small it was. Well, it spread and got significantly bigger to the point I decided I best exchange it.  Second unit arrives and everything looks good, I get it all set up and begin using it. Its almost* decent, stutters here and there but doable until I grabbed a few lightweight games from the market and it had a hard time with much of anything. On to linux apps, as this computer supports them and same thing as the market, just too much for this computer. If you only want to browse the web then I think this will do you ok, little dropped frames on video etc but ok, anything more and you might want to reconsider. This chromebook comes with a mediatek processor  which is about on par with lower classed intel celerons etc, great for price, battery useage but pretty bad for the consumer.","I wanted to upgrade my original Chromebook to something newer, and at the price with the touch screen, 64gb of storage, and other features this seemed like a good deal. And it certainly is! First, the Mediatek processor is faster and in my opinion runs better than the Celeron and other processors. With 4GB of Ram and 64GB of drive space this has much more than most other Chromebooks in the same price point. Although not full HD (my only complaint) the screen is colorful and vibrant, and the touch screen responsive. Converting from computer to tablet works seamlessly. Whats nice is with the Mediatek processor you can load most (not all) Android apps. Also, at my time of purchase, Google is giving you many offers for FREE like 100gb of Google drive space, among other things. You also have HDMI, SD card, headphone, and USB ports. The power adapter is USB-C as well. All in all this Chromebook is a great buy at this price. I was very happy with the speed and flawless operation. While it probably won't replace your Windows laptop or MacBook, its still a steal for web surfing, email, and light document and graphic editing. I'm very pleased with this purchase.","Windows 10 is dysfunctional, so I stopped using Windows a little over a year ago and reformatted my laptops to Linux.  I'm fairly cheap so the laptops only cost about $350 each.  The result... SLOW.  So I bought this Lenovo instead.  I love it. Quick, no boot time, everything auto saves.  Just close it and walk away.  I use it a lot and an hour charge lasts 24 hours without having to worry about plugging it in. The touch screen is great, no messing with the track pad just scroll and click by touching the screen.  The display is fantastic - great for watching movies.  It's a tad smaller than I'm used to, but it's fine.  It has no Caps Lock Key, it is a search key instead, so I sometimes hit search on accident when I want caps lock.  30 years of typing habit. The many ways to fold it are great as well.  It makes it easy to prop up and watch videos. The touch screen is not a \"tablet\" so you can't use it for art - just so it's clear. There are some things to learn if you haven't used Chrome OS as your main OS.  Youtube and reading a little helps.  I doubt there's anything I did with my laptop that I can't do with this and apps. Well worth the price.","This product was purchased in July, and by September had three keys not working on the keyboard.  By October both the delete and space keys started to not work (pressing them down did not produce a space, a \"h\" etc.)  In calling customer service we have to ship the computer, at our own cost, to Memphis and then be without a computer for 3 weeks or longer!!! This is incredibly inconvenient at a day and age when all of our children's homework is digital.  Something brand new should last longer than three months before breaking, and then we should not have to pay to ship it and just be without with no compensation for the loss.  Absolutely aggravating and infuriating.","Bought for grandkids for Christmas and it was dead before spring.  Battery failure.  Seller will not return and will not support.  I was shocked to discover such a short warranty window (two weeks by the seller), but my bad for not checking.  I'll certainly never buy another Lenovo product again.","The image and sound quality is pretty decent for the price point. The display can be a tiny bit pixelated at times but it isn't a deal breaker for me. The keys are plastic which isn't bad but it feels on the cheaper side.  When I move the screen in any way,from any angle, the LCD in the bottom corners turn white as if I were pressing on the screen. I am a little sad that the track pad isn't durable. I have received this computer today and the right click has already stopped clicking. I had high hopes for this machine as it was going to do everything that I hoped. I bought this to supplement my laptop when I travel to check emails and watch movies. Not sure if what I experienced is an isolated thing or if this is how this computer is made.","I picked up one of these for a song and I have to say its \"Nice\" I just wish the made nice android laptop at this price point. The screen is not that great, the field of view on it is wide but at an angle it looks awful and really bright. I hate the fact that they went with an SD card reader not a micro SD reader, it would have saved you some space on the board. I would like to have seen expandable M.2 memory slot on the device. Whenever I close the screen on the chromebook it disables the wifi module on the unit and  will no longer download items to the chromebook, It wont use the USB slot for ethernet, its USB-C port seems to only be used for charging (it had an issue registering a USB-C harddisk), its also not very light (which doesn't bother me however it would bother someone smaller then me and ALL OF THAT WIEGHT is the case nothing else. However; its fairly fast for what it is, the wifi antenna is nice and works well, the keys seem responsive (it also doesn't contain an on\/off butten as part of the keyboard (looks at apple)), it plays games well and read docs with okay accuracy, it also has a smart charging USB-C port so it will register if its receiving a higher\/lower then normal charge and inform you of such which is really cool. I give it 3 out of 5 stars, it my have issues but gets the job done.","Could not stream xfinity video! All video streams are pixelated and lagging while another device (much older) streams just fine. Video was 720p, not even 4k!  The other things: inability to scroll. Can't do it. You have to scroll with the arrow keys. No CAPS lock. You have to hit alt and some other key to enable caps lock. Also makes you log in every time. Using your Google account password every time. I created a PIN# in the settings (a 6 digit number code) but it won't accept it... still have to use Google password. Just needed this to stream video to a tv... can't do it.","The touch screen was always freezing up. There are lot of app said still can't be downloaded to a Chrome book I didn't realize this . And now the whole thing is frozen. The touch screen doesn't respond the keyboard doesn't respond I can't even turn it off I have to wait for the battery to run out.  This Chrome book was delivered on January 17th.  I am so so disappointed.","I was curious on what a chromebook had to offer since i never used or owned one and i'm in need of a laptop since i'm living somewhere else. This chromebook is fairly light and small and gets the job done and there little to no wait time when you open the chromebook turning on automatically. There a bunch of things i noticed while using it is you can link your phone with the chromebook in where once you previously log into the chromebook beforehand you can unlock your chromebook right after by unlocking your phone (both have to have bluetooth enable). To search up shortcuts you can easily click the search button on the keyboard and type in shortcut and it have it where you can search all the shortcuts you can do and what nice is any additional keyboard say a bluetooth one can also do some of the shortcuts. Also there are options where you can close the laptop and you have two options you can either put the laptop to sleep or it just turns off the screen then there a option to lock it by closing it or not. nice note is if you have display off you can still listen to pandora,mp3,or youtube. Also for those who are wondering - you can play minecraft, ragnorak mobile (not fully keyboard control it only for texting in chat so no WASD movement) and hearthstone on it so it have it nice touch but you cant use the split screen feature from chrome so that a bummer now for the drawbacks. Also you can use microsoft word, excel and powerpoint from the googleplay store but you would need a account for it or just use the free online version. This is small nit pick - the screen is 720p yet it clear but it is noticeable when you use it long enough wish it was HD or 1080p also some apps are set to the 720p by default. the google play store youtube uses the quality of the screen while chrome youtube (basically youtube normally on browser) is more clear. Also skype doesn't have screenshare or sharesound so that a major bummer and skype seem to run slow on the chromebook in terms having people sharescreen their desktop it always come out blurry on some occasions and i have to minimize and reopen skype to actually see what going on. i haven't try video call yet so it up to debate. Lastly for discord from google playstore you would need to adjust some of the call setting for it to work. the default setting would cut you off mid sentence and random pausing in between. Another thing is you can't adjust the idle timer it either it goes to sleep, display turns off or stays on there no option to change it and when you have option to lock your desktop it end your skype call so you would have to go into settings for normal use, call use, and game use. lastly is your better off having your laptop go into sleep mode with locked instead of turning it off. when you shut it down the screen goes blank white then gets brighter and brighter then goes to black. it's just me being paranoid like it would be better if it just dims and turns off instead of going very bright then poof black not to mention if you usually play on medium to low brightness setting then having your screen go maximum brightness with no setting to change it get annoying not to mention when you open up your chromebook after shutting it off it adjusted your brightness setting as well as well a bright chrome logo before going into login. Mostly this is a nit pick since it bothersome when you are using it in middle of the night then when you turn it off it hit you with the brightest setting so i just end up closing it to sleep mode or shut off and look away. All in all it a pretty good chromebook i just wish it had more options in the settings as well have priority app settings in task manager","Love this thing.  Wanted something I could use as a tablet also.  Was looking at the Samsung View 2, but its only with AT&T and the price is crazy.  Super pleased I chose this instead.  Quick startup,  great battery and easy to use.  The USB ports sold me on it.  Update to my previous review...I was enjoying it when without warning Prime Video app just crashed.  I rebooted and it installed system update without warning.  I then updated all apps and prime video app will not load.  App works great on 2 Android tablets.  Also the touchscreen gets very glitching when you have it folded in tent view or tablet mode.  Some of the options in different apps and in chrome browser don't respond.  And the bezel at the top, when in tablet or tent mode, is very distracting.  That black bezel at the top should be narrower.  Found myself reverting back to my smaller android tablet and MacBook Air more often than not.  The battery life is amazing.  But I probably wouldn't purchase again.","I'm updating my review and giving it 5 stars now that I've played with it a few days. I'm very impressed with the Lenovo. It is my first Chromebook and after many, many years of using Windows based computers, this had been a delight to use. I haven't had any problems. Before purchasing, I read the negative reviews and many said they couldn't access the Store to acquire new apps. I wanted to note that this hasn't been a problem. The device comes pre-loaded with the store app and I've been able to download and open all the apps I use on my phone and tablet. Though I will must note that is not a very long list. The only downside is that it is quite heavy in comparison to my tablet which I was hoping to mothball. Undecided at this point.  I think it will be a suitable replacement for my ancient laptop. I'll continue to use my PC for spreadsheets and extensive documents until I am more comfortable with this - my first Chromebook.","I was excited to get my first Chromebook.  Out of the box it looked cheaper and more flimsy than I could have imagined.  The setup was easy, then I noticed that the touch screen was not very responsive at all.  As a matter of fact it is easier to use the trackpad then to use the touch screen.  If you want any precision such as closing a window by hitting the x, you would have to use the trackpad.  The performance was abysmal and even the speakers sounded like crap - that is if you can even hear them.  Don't by this piece of garbage.  I returned mine and got another model by Lenovo which I am very happy with.  I honestly don't understand or believe all of the positive reviews about this chromebook.","So, disclaimer: I'm not a heavy computer user, meaning, all I mainly use a laptop for is browsing the web, using spotify and discord, and sometimes some Microsoft apps which i'll talk about. Pros: The battery can last a whole day of good usage, the screen quality is great, the keyboard feels nice, and my favorite thing: it's FAST! I was so sick of my slow as a** clunky hp laptop. It takes probably like 10 seconds to start up, and pages are quick to load. The laptop is a perfect size for sitting on your lap or putting in your bag, and it's really light to carry around. Not necessarily \"cons\", just stuff that takes a little to get used to: Like with any chromebook, most of the \"apps\" are just in another window of the browser. That being said, I managed to find a good add on to chrome for spotify and discord, but if you use other apps that you're used to on pc or mac, you might find that a problem. With microsoft apps, you could just use the online versions and they work fine for my student purposes. The touchpad feels a little inaccurate, but after some use, I got used to it. The two-finger scrolling and zooming feels nice, though. Also, the speakers are kinda washed out but again, I got used to it. Actual cons: It's crashed on me a handful of times already... normally, it's just a little annoying since it starts back up so quickly, but recently I had it crashed TWICE during an online midterm. Really though, that was just awful timing and otherwise I don't really mind it. Any issues I had at first were gone after time passed. Despite the issues, I'm giving it 5 stars since it's such a high quality laptop for the price. If you're a student that wants something simple, I recommend it.","I bought this primarily for my youngest daughter - my eldest already has a Chromebook, and kids at school are required to bring laptops now. Okay, no problem. On paper, this thing seemed pretty sweet - for what she uses it for. Her school uses G Suite, so it's perfect. The only major downside, and this one DOES annoy the crap out of me, is the SD slot. This might seem small and stupid, but the laptop doesn't have much internal storage, so you kind of NEED to expand it a bit with an SD card. The SD slot is one of those minimal-depth ones, so the card sticks 3\/4 of the way out when inserted. Yep. Not too pleased about that, but aside from that it's pretty good, and it's an easier transition for her since it's a touchscreen (because our children will have no idea what it's like to not have a touchscreen).","I purchased this computer on May 31st and used it approximately 3 times before a cross-country move on October 1st. Right before I began packing for that move, I went to sign into the computer and received the error message \u201cChrome OX is missing or damaged\u201d. I spent a great deal of time looking for a solution to this problem, and ultimately realized I\u2019d need to plug the Chromebook into another computer to reinstall the OS. I had purchased this inexpensive Chromebook as a replacement for my Mac \u2014 as my Apple computer is nearly 10 years old and runs very, very slowly. I have no interest in spending hours of my life attempting to get this computer up and running and wish I had purchased a quality replacement instead of a cheap system. If you\u2019re looking for an inexpensive computer to tide you over until you\u2019re ready to replace your main laptop \u2014 look elsewhere!! This computer absolutely is not worth the hassle for anyone planning to use it more than once. :(","I just bought this end of May 2019 so that's only about 5 months old and all of a sudden it will not charge.  There is nothing wrong with the plug it just no longer recognizes it.  This is ridiculous.  It worked well while it worked but to only last a few months is terrible.  What good is a machine that won't charge? Update: Well I decided to open it up since I\u2019ve read the warranty is only a month. Unscrewed the back and had to pop it open all around. I unplugged the battery plug and plugged it back in. That did the trick. Screwed the case back in and it works again. Still shouldn\u2019t have to do any of this.","I did the research, read the reviews, and like whoever is reading this, thought I'd go out on a limb and try a Chromebook. The first week the machine worked great and I had no complaints. The second week - not so much. It started randomly crashing about 5-10 times a day when I was browsing, causing me to shut the entire machine down and powerwashing it (Google's term for a full reboot). I troubleshooted for an entire day to no avail. Google support pointed me to Lenovo and Lenovo pointed me to Google. On the last day I had it, it crashed about 40+ times and I was about to discus it out my office window. Upon return, Amazon refunded my money but I was required to pay $47.50 for a laptop box. Long story short, do not buy this machine. There a many threads online about the C330 crashing fresh out of the box.","Alright, here's the gist. I was choosing between the Lenovo C330 and Acer R13 for a low end IPS touch screen chromebook. I bought both to physically compare. The Acer R13 was too bulky and big for my liking. So I went with the C330. At first, I thought that the trackpad noise the C330 was making was a manufacturing defect. I looked at reddit and saw that some people didn't have this issue while a lot did. So I bought another one to test out. It also had the same plastic tapping noise the first one I bought had. SO, I bought a third one. Same problem. The Acer R13 and my Acer E15 Windows laptop did not make these noises. Either the people on reddit are deaf, or I was unlucky and received 3 BRAND NEW broken laptops. What a shame. Another thing that is important to note is that I tried each computer for 2 DAYS at my classes and ALL 3 of the Lenovo laptops lagged and crashed while my Acer R13 did not crash or lag once. I only have 10 tabs of chrome open and discord open. Lenovo needs to step their game up. The only objective problem with my Acer R13 laptop is that the left click clicks twice in order to activate. Now listen here, I have the money to buy a high end chromebook and not deal with these issues that come packaged with low end chromebooks, so I 'm not asking for pity.  I'm just giving a warning to everyone else about these low quality computers. FYI, I'm not keeping these Lenovo cr*pbooks. I'm returning them and going with the only other option, the R13. AND I'm not a shill btw. I am a real person that does not care about laptops because I custom build gaming computers. Laptops should only be used to type notes and watch videos. At least I could remove all my info and data by easily powerwashing these computers.","I bought this with trepidation because I do a lot of Python programming and I thought I might not be able to use my favorite IDE's  and packages.  In developer mode, just choose the linux option.  Presto, Python 3.5.3 is pre-installed and so is the Ubuntu terminal.  I installed my favorite commands like \"locate\" that were not there, and, after some research, got Spyder (without Conda), Jupyter, Idle3, etc. working fine.  Of course I installed pip3 first.  You can put python programs on external storage (usb or sdram card) and run them from there.  I find I use this machine for programming even when my other laptops and work station are just as close.  I use Meko stylus pens on the touch screen -- great! See other reviews for comments about quality, etc.  I love this machine.","The lenovo c330 is an example of one of the biggest strengths of chromebooks,, excellent value. For $250 this thing is an absolute steal, it's fast, has a pretty decent ips panel and is a 2 in 1. It comes with the google play store and linux support too. I'd like to compare this to the much more expensive ipad pro when it comes to being a \"PC replacement\" to give you an idea on the usability you can expect when you want to use this as a laptop. You have a full mouse support, a full desktop browser, a file system, a full size HDMI port to display your chromebook on a bigger screen out of the box, it has a USB type A port for legacy peripherals and a USB type C port. When you want to use it as a tablet just flip the keyboard around and use apps from the google play store. The screen is only 720p since it is a budget device at the end of the day but I am giving you an idea on the versatility of using a chromebook as a computer vs an ipad pro which is directly competing with chromebooks as a PC replacement machine. This is all around an excellent chromebook for the price and definitely the best all around laptop in it's price range as I am writing this.","I bought this to replace a Google Home (GH) \"Smart Speaker\" on my bedside table. I leave it plugged into the wall. You can turn on \"Goggle Assistant\" so that you can ask questions and get audio answers w\/o pressing a button. Unlike the GH (and other \"smart speakers\") you have full access to the web, email, movies from Amazon and Netflix, radio stations (via TuneIn, etc), your calendar, phone calls (via Google Voice), and a myriad of other applications (via Google PlayStore). In my bedroom it replaces the Amazon Echo too. If I were to use it as a (portable) laptop\/tablet it would be fine for that as well. Frankly, I don't know why anyone would buy any other device for their bedside table (and I have looked at more than one).","I've been an enthusiastic chromebook user for many years.  I dumped a glass of wine on my 5yr old asus and it was time to update.  The Lenovo c330 is a beautiful machine. Fast, great battery life, really loved the 360 hinge.  It worked great as a touch screen tablet. Awesome colors and sharp clear images on the screen. I liked my new lenovo so much I bought for my kid as he turned his old asus into a linux\/unbutu machine so he could practice coding. Near the end of the return window my c330 stopped playing video's from any format except youtube. Couldn't even open photos on fb.  The fix was a powerwash but it wasn't a permanent fix. So I returned it and got another. That one and another (total of 3) suffered the same failure. Apparently lenovo does not offer help desk support for chromebooks.  My kids c330 works fine. I was ready to get a 4th but they were back ordered and the price had gone up so I selected a different mfg. Except for that failure I would still be loving the c330.","The screen resolution and viewing angles are amazing on this device. My daughter does her homework in Chromebook mode and she turns it into a tablet when she wants to play Android games. Performance is snappy and we have yet to see any stutters. I personally would say this is the best Chromebook you can purchase as a great value. It's inexpensive, it's high quality build, the specs and performance, and the overall appearance make this near perfect.","My first impression is how did I ever do without it. I am a longtime computer user starting with a \"Sinclair\" that used a cassette  recorder for a hard drive . Then the Commodore  64 came out  and I had one of them. Eventually got a Desktop with Windows 3.1  then Windows got fancier every time , the last one I really liked was XP. I also had a IBM mainframe that came complete with all the huge disk drives  and a 6 ' wide printer and all the operating manuals and took a 16 ' box truck to move. Then Microsoft changed to Windows 7 , liked it OK but it got worse and worse with updates and then the notice about  quitting support and get Windows 10 or else! Well for me its else! I have tried Win 10  and absolutely hated it. Good bye Microsoft! I read all the reviews on every brand of Chromebook that I could afford being a disabled Vet. I decided on this Lenovo C-330. Ordered it on 7\/16\/2019 and got it the next day. Had no trouble whatsoever with setup , I followed the setup guide  and figured it would take hours to charge the battery and then do the setup. I let it charge for about 30 minutes and then decided  to take a look. I  was surprised that ir was fully charged and in seconds it had booted up, updated its self and all my stuff was available from my old computer. The only thing that didn't meet the description was that the spec's said it had a Micro SD card slot and this one has a full size slot. Sure it has a small keyboard but I can only use 2 fingers anyway and  use a mouse to browse with and the touch screen to read books so its no hardship to me.  All in all  if you are a fence sitter like me don't wait any longer and buy your self a Chromebook ! The only thing this machine needs is more USB ports (I have a port on order)  and make sure to print out the PDF  user guide on Amazon since the enclosed one with the machine is  one page folded 2 ways and the PDF is 20 + pages.","We got the C330 for my wife to poke around on the internet and to use a few Android Apps. It is nice and fast even with quite a few tabs open. So far the Android apps she has used have all worked well. The touchscreen on it is responsive. It does show fingerprints like crazy though. We bought a matte screen protector for it and it made it MUCH nicer to use because if repelled the finger prints. Overall we've been VERY happy with this chromebook, so much so that we're considering one for myself so that I stop stealing my wife's :-)","I bought this to use with G Suite and apparently when you use G Suite it disables almost all functionality. I have literally spent hours now on phone support with Google just to figure out how to get basic functionality. It took them over an hour just to figure out how I could enable Play Store and download the Calendar app. Now I'm on hold again waiting for them to figure out why Assistant isn't working. I got this because it was supposed to be so simple and easy to use but it's been the biggest nightmare of any computer I have ever owned. I am honestly shocked at what a disaster it has been trying to use a Chromebook with G Suite and I am very close to just closing my account and returning this Chromebook.","I bought this computer while on a trip to replace a different Lenovo computer that died while I was on deadline for an assignment while traveling. Fortunately, I was able to get this next-day Prime delivered to where I was staying in LA and began using it minutes after it arrived. To make this review easy, I'm breaking it down by main key features: display, keyboard, battery life, and build quality. Display: For the price, I don't think you're going to find one much nicer in terms of resolution and quality. Incredibly, you are getting a true IPS panel with nice viewing angles. I've found that the low res matte displays on other cheaper Chromebooks are incredibly difficult use and lead to eye strain. I'm a personal believer in purchasing as much screen real estate and pixel density as possible -- it really does make a huge difference. Another huge plus (and I'm not sure if this across the Chromebook line or specific to this one) is the night mode that cuts out blue light and boosts yellows -- this is another hugely important feature for me, personally. Touch screen functionality works fine. Display cons are that the bezels are massive and with it being super glossy, there can be lots of glare. Keyboard: Basically Lenovo has it figured out with keyboard layouts and feel. While it's nowhere near as nice as the Thinkpad keyboard, this one is laid out quite nicely and is easy to complete bigger writing assignments on. There's no backlight, which would be a huge plus, but for the price, it's difficult to find anything to complain about. The top row function keys will be familiar to those coming from the Mac ecosystem. Everything is very easy. The trackpad is also surprisingly nice for the price as well. Gestures work without issue. Battery life: This is where this computer truly shines. I purchased this while I was traveling during the winter and needed to it to complete weekly freelance assignments and had plenty of battery life while on the road. Even when being back home laying in bed watching Youtube or Netflix, the battery lasts all night, and then some. I basically never take the charger with me because I don't feel that it's necessary (unless it's already low on juice). In terms of just general surfing and Google doc stuff, you should be able to get a couple of days out of the battery. If you're watching videos and streaming, it's still a good full day's worth of battery life. Build quality: I've previously had an HP Chromebook and was not impressed by the build quality by any means. It felt cheap, almost like a toy. While this Lenovo Chromebook feels much more solid, I still wouldn't compare it to a Thinkpad or the higher end machines in Lenovo's lineup. Still, it feels quite durable and I've never worried about carrying it in a pack all day, or stacking books and other heavy items on top of it. The only thing that is kind of a bother is that the brilliant white finish does get smudges and dirty fingerprints on it. But that's more of a nuisance, not a flaw with the machine. For the price, you really can't do much better. So long as you have reasonable expectations for what you're getting and how much you're paying, you will be very pleased by this product.","I like the fact that it's like one big phone. You can download your apps, and if You dont want to use as a laptop you can fold it and use it as a tablet. Also great for school i got this lapto because i am taking online classes. Wifi works great, the only thing that i had a problem with is scrolling down on the screen. I was use to just hovering the cursor over the side of the screen. But end up just using the up down arrows to scroll, And it would be best to get a wireless mouse. Other than that great lap top. (Update) i literally just found out you  can scroll up and down the screen in laptop form just by touching the screen. It doesn't have to be in tablet form to do so, and you don't have to just use the up down keys..had a blonde moment.. in other words just continue to mess around and play with your laptop lol","Pros: The Chromebook is snappy and fairly fast. It's a very stylish and light weight device on the go. The Chromebook offers the google play store and touchscreen is handy with apps. The screen quality is great enough to read books clearly for a long period of time. Ultimately, this is a great Chromebook depending on what you want to do, such as browsing, school, apps, book and audiobook storage. Cons: The speakers are on the bottom of the Chromebook, where sound can be muffled. This can easily be fixed with headphones and the Chromebook supports Bluetooth. The SD card slot is not big enough, the card hangs out. The Chromebook does not have a grippy feel to it, very slippery. The keyboard may feel cramped to some. Also, the body of this Chromebook is not very durable. I dropped this thing and the body easily dents. I mean, it's a pretty body but not practical for my use for the long term. Also, I rarely use tablet or portrait positions on this tablet because it's so awkward. It's made to be used vertically and it's a bit bulky. But it's great for apps and video. Overall, I'm happy, but for the price point some things could be better. But, this Chromebook certainly beats a Windows computer I have sitting around at a similar price point .","My wife picked this up for me as a late Father's Day\/early birthday gift. I've been using Chromebooks since 2014, and I've always enjoyed them. Since I'm about to deploy to Kuwait, I've been in the market for a tablet. So, my wife thought I'd be a good idea to order this Chromebook for me as it is a 2-in-1 model. And, I'm super thankful that she did. I am really impressed with this device. Although it is a bit heavier than I would want, it does everything that I need it to do and more. Initially, I was a bit bothered by the large bezels on the screen. I figured the company could have definitely made them quite smaller. However, as you can see from the picture above, the bezels are actually the right size for one-handed holding when in tablet mode. The bezels actually prevent accidental touches to the screen, so that is much more useful than I originally thought. For the price, this is a fantastic Chromebook. Battery life is good, the screen is quite responsive, and the programs show up really well on the screen. Also, this Chromebook (as well as many of the newer versions) come installed with the Google play store. So, you have the ability to download many of the apps to your Chromebook that you currently have on your Android device. That is super helpful... and, as an avid reader, the Kindle app looks fantastic on this screen!","Died after 40 days. Lenovo support is atrocious. They try to do anything and everything to not create a repair request. Took three phone calls. Now I have to ship the unit to them at my cost for repair even though it\u2019s warranty.","Replacement for my \"expired Chromebook update deadline\" trusty Acer Chromebook. New Lenovo would not pair with my Bluetooth devices (followed all of the instructions to turn off, turn on Bluetooth and Chromebook, nada!), Smart Lock was glitchy (meaning I had to manually re-enter my VERY STRONG, aka long and tedious password), bezel larger than my previous CB, nice resolution but functionally smaller screen. Returning, very disappointed. Buyers beware!","This is my first Chromebook. I decided to get one because most of what I use a computer for doesn't require anything more heavy duty than what this has to offer. I'll still use my other computer should I require things like Photoshop or those heavier use programs, but since I got my Chromebook a week ago, I haven't even touched my other laptop. The Pros: Battery life - When it estimates that I have 12-13 hours of battery life, it means it. I can stream videos and multitask and it doesn't sacrifice that time. Time to charge is also impressively quick. Speed - I open the lid and it's on. It's that simple. No waiting for everything to load up. I had to do an update and it took maybe 10 seconds, including restart time. I know internet will vary depending on network, but I'm able to easily multitask and it's not dragging. I'm currently casting a video to my TV and have multiple tabs open on chrome, all with no lag to the video (which would often happen with my other laptop). Ease of use - If you're already a chrome\/google user, switching over to a chromebook is a piece of cake. I didn't have to transfer anything, and I do have to eventually back a few more things up to my Drive, but again, that's easy. Getting used to more app-based programs than desktop ones is easy enough too.  Almost everything that would have required a windows download has an app version or a way to use it on a chromebook as well. Screen\/Tablet mode - I haven't toyed too much with the touch screen, but it's a nice perk. I like being able to flip the screen around and turn it to the side and bam, it's a big tablet. So far I've only used it like this once to read some comics, but it was nice. Brightness is great too. I usually have it down halfway or less even. Size - I was worried about it being too small because my other laptop is somewhere between 13-14'' but it's a really great size. This thing is incredibly light too. Much lighter than I'd expected. Love it. The Cons, though extremely minor: Caps Lock - Mostly, it's a \"getting used to\" factor that I just haven't quite mastered yet. There's no caps lock key, and the search button that replaces it isn't terrible, but I think I'd have preferred to just have the caps key. (You can just press alt+search for caps lock easily enough though) Backlighting - my other computer had backlit keys. Totally an \"extra\" that's not necessary, but regardless. And that's it. If you're looking for something light and simple for everyday use, this is an incredible choice.","I have never hated an inanimate object so much in my entire life. Everything crashes. All. the. time. Even with only simple browsing and a messenger app. The settings randomly change all the time with no purpose and no reasoning. Today, the time\/settings that show up in the shelf disappeared.... for seemingly no reason and randomly. It was impossible to determine how to add it back to the shelf. One must \"powerwash\" this ridiculous useless thing OVER AND OVER, just to make it stay the way you want it.... for a little while. This is the lamest most ridiculous piece of JUNK I have ever bought in my life. The touchscreen is nice, convertible aspect is nice, but I would give that away in a HEARTBEAT for a machine that does what I TELL IT TO DO.","I've had this just over a week. I am loving it. The keyboard is reminding me so much of my Mac. Nice and smooth touchpad. Great responsive touch screen. Great battery life. I can get my work done, watch some movies, browse... everything I want to do for a fraction of the cost of the Mac. Fingers crossed it holds my affections for a long, long time to come! For now...totally worth the $299 list price and I got it even less, so happy consumer here!","WOW, what a fantastic laptop, It s fast, practical, and offers exactly what i need. I was recommended this particular brand by my brother and i am glad i took his advice. If you are not techie this laptop if for you. It is easy to navigate and get the job done whether you are using it for work or just to internet surf and shopping. Don't hesitate. Get it.","My first Chromebook, after using Android tablets for 90% of my computing needs. Like the speed (incl quick start-up), runs cool, handles all my Android apps, battery life >>10 hours, lightweight, compact. Not using in tablet mode as much as I expected but nice to have the option. The 4 GB ram & 64 GB SSD are great upgrades from original specs and make this unit such a tremendous value. Keyboard & trackpad work well. Good port selection too incl USB 3, USB C, HDMI, & headphone. Update: I've noticed sales on this & similar 2-in-1 chromebooks during this holiday season. Be sure you know if you're looking at a 64 gb model vs the 32 gb model; also, don't get confused by this C330 and the similar but traditional-clamshell S330.","We really like the wide viewing angle good sound system . Younger people may not appreciate that as much as we do because our hearing & sight is not as good as it was many years ago,  Resolution could be better but for the most part is easy to see and hear. My wife has been using the C330 almost exclusively after we purchased it. There are several android apps that do not work well but the android apps she needs these days do work OK and that is all that is important for now. She did not like using the GMAIL app, so we turned on the linux option and installed the linux version Thunderbird mail .  Thunderbird mail  takes a little longer to start up than the other apps but seems to work very well. This is an ARM device so many of the applications that work on the Raspberry Pi etc will work on this device. Once installed the program icons can be placed on the shelf to be started as any other app.. There is\/was a learning curve as the Chomebook does not have all the settings where  android devices normally keep the same settings. It appeared you must keep it in developer mode to run apps from unknown sources making it less desirable for us to access the Amazon App store. Switching to and from developer mode requires a complete reset, but as soon as you log in to Google your settings and apps are restored. It takes a few minutes, so it is not something you want to do often. In tent mode the Lenovo Chomebook is nicer than using the Samsung 8.1 tablet on a stand.  We used a wireless mouse at first but found it easier to just use the touch screen.  However the touch screen does not work as good as the regular android devices we  own.  We did play with the \"text\" mode where you write on the screen and it adds it to your document, fun but not for us. Overall, we are happy with the purchase, we did not want to spend a lot of money for a high priced quality Chromebook until we knew we would actually like using it.  As others have noted, this Chrome box is pretty nice, for the most part easy to use and probably more secure than most regular laptops.  Google's Chrome OS is getting better but in it's current state of development it is good enough for us to use every day.","I had to come on here and review this tablet because of how much I love them. We bought two of these new last Christmas for our kids. I am actually re gifting one to my niece this year as my son has \u201cgrown \u201c out of it. (Video games) I am a full time online student and my puppy had chewed up my charger to my expensive laptop. I had a ton of homework due. I frantically ran around town trying to replace my charger, but since it is so new and such a high wattage, I would have had  to order straight from the manufacturer which would not help me that weekend. I logged onto my daughters chromebook and set up all my classes which it ran everything perfectly! I couldn\u2019t believe it and almost wondered why I paid so much for my big laptop. Compared to mine this thing is so cute and portable. I love the white. The screen quality is amazing and very vivid. It\u2019s zippy fast! I love the touch screen and my MacBook or gaming laptop doesn\u2019t even have that. I love how it\u2019s set up with google. My kids use google docs for school. I just wanted to give this review for those who are looking for a chromebook because even a year later these are amazing. No viruses to worry about or ads. If I didn\u2019t need a MacBook for graphic design Or photography I would be just fine with a little chromebook. Things they will will not do; run Excel, design software or big games. If you just want it for app games , surfing the internet , doing homework, watching Netflix or any other program it\u2019s perfect. I even accessed Microsoft 365 for some of my work. Such a great little laptop.","If you are looking for a Windows type laptop this is not for you. It has been a learning curve but I am getting more comfortable with it. Best thing is you can use the keyboard or fold it all the way around and use it as a tablet. Can't beat the price.","Stay away. Keyboard stopped working twice in first 3 weeks (spacebar, z,x,c,v keys). Returning. Lenovo customer service was a joke so don\u2019t expect help there. Other than that, I guess it was adequate. Screen wasn\u2019t easy to open though. Annoying. Had an acer R11 2-1 for over a year now with no issues. I went for the Lenovo for double the storage plus caught a great sale price on amazon. Now, I\u2019m out a chromebook and just missed a deal of the day amazon Acer R-11 sale. EDIT: Ok...so my review was a kneejerk reaction after speaking with Lenovo tech support. I added a star to better legitimize the rating. The chromebook worked as it should when it did work. I'm just soured about the keyboard failing on me multiple times and difficulties getting through to Lenovo (which was a waste). I was within my return window so I decided to exchange through Amazon. I'll update my review once I have time with the replacement.","I mean it's a Chromebook, they are the only computers I buy at this point but seriously a touchscreen to boot for $200?!? This thing is awesome! Only downside is that I find myself trying to scroll down like a touchscreen on my work HP computer because that feature makes getting work done so very seamless. This unit is durable as I use it every day in my PE class to take attendance, gather data for grading and fitness tests and work the remainder of the day with Athletic Admin details without having to charge it but once a day.  It also allows a lot of my Google Play apps to download since it doubles as a tablet in flipped mode. I have used this paired with my Bluetooth devices to do indoor bike training and it works like a charm to record workouts with a much better screen to read than my phone.","I've had it for a few months now and I really like it. Any of the negatives below relate to software - specifically MS office. Otherwise no complaints. 1. It requires some patience as you transition from MAC or Windows to the Chrome OS. Just take your time. I recommend not buying this as a gotta-have-today replacement. If your current PC is failing but still operating & you want to make the switch, do it before your PC fails. That way you can wade into your Chromebook. 2. Excellent value for the price. 3. The software is mostly free and available. My Chromebook email syncs my iCloud, Gmail, and Comcast accounts seamlessly.  Note: I do not have business accounts on this device. 4. Not to get geeky, but I did the research on processors. Their MediaTek MT8173C outperforms the other available processors in benchmark tests. 5. Get 64GB, not 32 or 16. Space fills up fast, especially if you aren't good deleting emails, etc. 6. Add a low-profile thumb drive. With another 64, 128, or even 256 GB, storing pix is a breeze. 7. 2:1 is nice, but I don't use it much. Nice to have feature for me. 8. The battery is great. With the multi-use type-C connector, it doubles as a port. Now, at 67%, I still have over 5 hours left. 9. Screen res is very good. Clearer than other laptops I've had. No complaints. 10. MS Office. I just don't like working on-line with Office. First, this is a small screen. Second, no matter the Internet connection, it is jerky - the cursor doesn't move smoothly. I wish I had an acceptable substitute - have tried others, but they are worse. 11. Mouse? No problem. 12. Plastic build some purists complain about? No problem, the fit and finish are excellent. Just don't drop it. 13. Some lap-heat, but not too bad. 14. The keyboard is crisp and responsive. Yes, I would buy it again. For $257.99 today, it's a steal.","For what I paid for this I should have bought 2!  This thing is extremely useful.  Great battery life and my daughter uses it for school work.  Outstanding purchase!","Picked this up to replace my old Toshiba Chromebook that I dropped, and which was approaching the end of it's auto-update Chrome life. Runs fine if you're a Chromebook user, which I am. First Chromebook I've had that runs apps, and I very much like using the streaming apps - Hulu, Netflix, etc. - and reading apps such as Scribd and Kindle. But news apps like the Washington Post or NYTimes just don't look right to my eye, so I tossed those and default to their web page. First touchscreen I've had as well, and it's pretty handy scrolling through web pages and turning the page in Sribd. However, I'm a bit obsessive about fingerprints on my screens, so that drives me nuts. I picked up a Moshi TeraGlove which does the trick. But that brings me to the only real beef I have about this unit, which is the tremendous black bezel surrounding the screen. Fingerprints and smudges really stand out. I understand that might be something necessary for tablet mode, but I hate tablet mode, although I love folding the screen back for tent mode. From looking at the tablets of folks I know it's obvious fingerprints and smudges don't bother a lot of people. I'm adjusting. The display for video is fine, although large-font text is a bit fuzzy on certain sites. Maybe I need a new prescription. I've never met laptop speakers I like, so these sound no better or worse to me. The white plastic looks a bit goofy, but for $250, if you're a Chromebook fan there's nothing wrong with this device.","I really wanted to like this product but in the end had to return it. I did everything to keep it. The product is built with sturdy plastic material that would have fooled me as something else. The display is great under normal\\typical conditions. The OS is super fast and you can use google play and Linux etc. Tons of storage about 49 GB available. The hinge felt good. I used it everyday and stop using my now 7 year old windows 10 i3 laptop. What went wrong. Well the screen display was good but it was a little too small at 11.6 inches. The really bad part was the Bluetooth issues. When using Chromebook in laptop mode i use a Bluetooth capable mouse which often stop working randomly for no apparent reason. The Bluetooth would stop responding and once turned off not work again until you power cycled the system. I tired everything to resolve the issue including powerwashing it which is a hard reset to factory. Nothing resolved it. I called tech support and they scripted me. Asked me to powerwash it and then asked me to send it in for motherboard replacement which had a turn around of 9 business days... That is when i decided it was time to let go and return this Chromebook. I highly recommend Chromebooks just not this one. Maybe spend a little more and get something of higher quality if want to use all features especially Bluetooth. Update: 06\/26\/19 It turns out the Bluetooth issue is a conflict with Chrome OS and my Victsing mouse. I now have an Acer r13 and have the same issue. The C330 is nice little multi use Chromebook that is priced nicely. The r13 is bit slower than c330 from my experience so far. The r13 has bigger display and uses micro sd  card that doesn't stick out like on the c330. Also the r13 you only get 32 GB as apposed to 64 GB with C330. I give the C330 3.5 stars. Overall r13 is not a major update over C330 for around $80 dollars more. However they are both very good Chromebooks with big difference being the screen size and on board storage.","First week with this Chromebook. Likes: light, battery life, value, general usability - no major compromises as far as I can tell switching from Windows 10. The convertible functions great. I switched to tablet mode and rotated to portrait mode while reading a PDF doc the other day in the office and felt like a boss :) Not so much: Keyboard feels and sounds cheap. Same for the mousepad - functions fine but is loud on click. For me working in tech and surrounded by people on macbooks, this chromebook looks nice, but lacks that last mile of refinement. Another low is it only has a single USB slot (should have read the specs more closely) which for me means when I work at home I'll need to invest in some sort of docking solution to connect external mouse and keyboard. The screen is OK - so far no major issues with resolution (1 exception ironically enough is the Google account icons on the top right - the circular profile pic is pixelated on the edges). There is a wide border between the edge of the computer and the edge of the screen - about 1 inch on top, left and right and  1.5 to 2 inches on the bottom. Overall I'm still giving it 4 out of 5 because for a home computer, this thing is awesome. But for me as my primary work laptop, I think I will need to look into going up a tier to one of the nicer Chromebooks.","I bought this with the intention of only using it for weekends when I'm away from work, but still on call. It's so portable and easy to bring anywhere. It goes from start up, to ready to use in a matter of seconds. The battery life is incredible! Like nothing I have ever seen. I can easily get 10 hours out of it. Using it off and on, for an hour or two at a time, I can get a week or more out of the battery without having to ever charge it. I just it for an hour or two and shut it down, it last's at least a week. I have left it on for, four days, while using it and letting it go to sleep, and I can still get 5 days of use out of the battery. This was never a purchase to replace my laptop....but I have to say, I've maybe turned my laptop on...... 3 times tops since buying this 3 months ago. I don't have enough good to say about this little guy! Buy it! The touchscreen is awesome, and the fact that it can fold in half so you can use it as a tablet is so neat! Don't hesitate. Buy this Chromebook!","Got this for my mom. I had bought her 1st Chromebook 4 or 5 years ago. Everyone in the family attacked me for having done that at the time. I coached her and all went great. So I just replaced that one with a newer and more slick model. She uses it for surfing the web, emailing, watching movies and loves it. The self standing mode to watch movies without seeing the keyboard is a plus. I may get one for myself too.","Ok my review on this Chromebook will be detailed 1. The screen: Considering this Chromebook is very cheap. It's a nice screen, it has good quality, not so great color accuracy, but it's still great. It's touchscreen and it responds great. No problems at all. 2. Keyboard: This keyboard let's me type fast. Really fast. It has good travel, it feels quick. It's very nice! 3. Audio: Here is where I spected a downside but no, it sounds good. Not very loud to be honest but good quality. The speakers are down facing like most of the regular laptops nowadays but it sounds very good, even if you put it on the bed. 4. Battery Life. You can easily get 14-15 hours of light use(Surfing on the web, reading). 10-12 Hours of moderate use (working on documents, watching YouTube videos, Netflix) 8 hours of heavy use (Gaming) 5.  Look & Feel Looks nice! No problem, it looks like a Lenovo laptop, very formal, very professional, it does have that Chromebook logo that screws up a little bit the professional look but that's fine. It feels strong, it wont fall apart very easily, it won't scratch easily too because it's like hard plastic but very well made. To finish I would like to say that if you're on a budget and need a laptop that can get the job done, this is for you. Remember this is a Chromebook and ChromeOS is more like it was an Android tablet with steroids . You can't freely install any software here, like Microsoft Office, Photoshop, etc, you're basically stuck with the web versions of those, but again this is to keep it simple.","I have several window computers, two tablets, a kindle and 2 phones.  After doing my income tax return on my Windows computer I got so frustrated with Windows 10 and printing issues I decided to look at Chromebooks.  After researching I purchased this Lenevo because of the ratings and the 60gb hard drive.  I received it quickly and had it set up in no time.  I synced it with my phone and tablet and it is great.  The battery life is amazing and the multi-position screen can't be beat.  The screen size and keyboard are the perfect size for me.  I haven't encountered any issues and am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend to others looking for an inexpensive alternative to Windows or Mac laptop.","Won't load simple apps like Amazon Music. Wanted this for our entertainment device but it says 'not compatible' with normal apps. Bluetooth disconnects for no reason. It is not usable and going back.","Absolutely no dislikes with this. I've had mine for quite a while, and it has replaced my phone and my Kindle for surfing and social media. If you are looking for storage capacity, which I don't need, Chrome Books won't work for you, but if a flash drive or cloud is fine for you then get this. Light, nice size (first laptop I've taken with me on a non-business trip) display is great. I watch my shws on this more than my Surface, which I also love. The ability to fold it around is everything. I did my homework, and folks who rated it high weren't wrong.","Some pros: For the price, this laptop is great for internet browsing and if you have a google\/gmail account, you can connect everything to it.  I use google photos on my phone, so it was great to have the photos back up into the laptop with just a push of a button.  There was also a promo that came with extra space on the google drive for 2 years when I bought this chromebook.  The touchscreen works pretty well, although not as smooth as iPad\/iphone level, but i was able to use Adobe Sketch and Whiteboard apps when I needed to \"draw\" for my class or studying. Battery life is pretty good.  I ran YouTube videos (some on 1080p), charged my phone, and read on kindle at the same time (sometimes switching between different reading such as adobe pdf viewer apps) and the battery lasted a good solid 8 hours, so if you need a light laptop with a long battery life, this is a good option. Some cons: The memory SD slot -  I didn't like how when you place the memory card in the slot, it sticks out, but I hardly use it anyways so it doesn't bother me too much. Another thing, some apps aren't compatible as they are on a windows\/apple.  Even if the apps are available on Google Play, some of them either didn't load at all or they would not work as smoothly as it would on a windows \/ apple.  The good thing though is there's a lot of alternate programs, but if you are someone that needs a laptop for strictly a particular program\/app that may only work on windows\/apple, this might not be for you. Overall, for the price and quality, I think this is a great laptop.  I use it for internet browsing and for my school work to read pdfs and for studying and I'm satisfied with the product."],"27":["I received this computer on Thursday, marked brand new. 20 minutes after setting up part of my screen glitched up and became pixelated. I gave it a little while and it was fine even though it did it again at other times. Tinkering around, I opened up the drawing pad only to discover there was a drawing already in there. Not a professional demo one, just something someone drew. I called up Amazon and asked if this was refurbished, they said no. I described the issues and they were nice and courteous and are sending out a replacement immediately. Until I receive a brand new one as promised, I will leave my review at 3 stars. It is a great computer, but this issue was a bit of a let down. Make sure you check your products before the 30 day mark expires.","A very nice laptop and it feels premium. The material is mostly plastic but I appreciate that for the reduced weight. This is my first Ryzen machine, and I am mainly using it to run a Citrix environment (cloud-based VM). Today will be the first full 8+-hour day using it. The power brick is not excessively huge. About the width and height of a standard post-it note, and 1\" thick. The cable is over 5' (my measuring tape only goes to 60\") closer to 6'. It has a barrel connector so unfortunately, it is not easily replaceable with a USB C cable (next model, pretty please?) The keyboard is backlit, which is nice for the darker surrounding often found in my home office. Typing is okay, but there is a noticeably shorter key travel than other laptops\/Chromebooks I have used. I'm getting used to it, but like with any new keyboard, there will be a small learning curve. I keep missing the home row and using the Caps Lock as the A key for some reason. I'm using it on a small folding table at the moment so that could be the reason. The screen is nice, it is a 16:9 full HD screen, and for me, I prefer 16:9 to the new standard of 2:3 (more of a square). It is not bright though. Not at all. Even with the curtains open, there are times when I am still trying to get more brightness out of this display. It's not unusable, but forget trying to use it outdoors. Touch is fine and works. I did not buy this to use as a tablet though but Windows 10 has some processing going on in the background that makes it easy to hit small buttons in applications without being terribly accurate. The pen is interesting to me as it is roughly the size of a real pen [*cough* Samsung*cough*] which makes it easier to draw\/write with without immediately cramping my hand. The Dolby Audio on the speakers leaves a lot to be desired. Some tweaking was needed to get the overblown sounds to subside. During the initial setup, it was hard to listen to. Turning Dolby Audio off though somehow reduces the speaker volume by 2\/3... Not the actual volume percentage, but the actual sound. Dolby is using some sort of gain control so 20% volume sounds more like 40%. 4k video on YouTube looks great and only dropped 3 frames in a 2:44 video (Borderlands 3 FLAK FTW!) but that could have been from me trying to make it full-screen.  I have not tried any games yet, but I did install Diablo 3, and World of Warcraft Classic. If anyone is interested, I will update this when I try them. With the Vega graphics, there is an automatic 2GB reduction in RAM availability. Couple this with the 8GB model and you are left with 6GB to run Windows 10 and any applications. Budget for the 12 GB model unless you are A) skilled with laptop hardware, and B) don\u2019t care about the warranty. I\u2019ve seen the tear-downs, and there is an open RAM slot. I usually don\u2019t tear open electronics until a year after I own it (unless there is a reason to do so). The WiFi issue that is detailed on the 8GB model is non-existent for me. I feel like I may be more qualified to test that as Citrix requires a constant network connection and gives an immediate alert if connectivity drops for more than a couple seconds. No issues here, running the latest Windows updates. Overall I\u2019m happy with this laptop, It is much lighter than my 15\u201d Acer Predator and looks a lot more professional when traveling for work.","Disclaimer: I am a serious computer geek and a bit of a snob when it comes to tech. Still, this laptop is awesome!! Rating: 5 Stars (because 4.8 isn't an option and 4 is too few for this thing) Model: 12 GB RAM; Ryzen 5 3500U Pros: > That price! (Unmatched in performance in this price range!) > Ryzen 5 3500U performs better than the Intel Core i5-8250U. > Vega 8 graphics are fairly capable. > Backlit keyboard is nice and a pleasure to type on > Light and portable > Great port selection. > 12 GB of RAM is sufficient for most daily tasks. (Expandable to 20 GB if your the warranty voiding type) > Decent sound for its class > Comes with a pen that works very well with the software > Great touchscreen Cons: > Can't charge via USB-C (Lenovo! Please do this for the next model!!) > Screen brightness is sufficient, but not suitable for outdoor use. > Pen stores very awkwardly (Lenovo! You can really do better!) > McAfee preinstalled, and it resists being uninstalled. (You actually need to download their uninstaller to do it. IMHO its more of a virus than an antivirus.) > Battery life is definitely OK. Its not a super long lasting battery but I seem to get 5 hours out of it at a time (in balanced mode and dimming the brightness a bit - honestly, you get what you pay for. My take: I bought this laptop for graduate school. I wanted something I could use to take written notes as well as use to do all my assignments. It needed to be portable, fairly lightweight, all while not compromising on performance. This laptop fit my needs on paper. Now, after using it (practically daily) for a month, I can say its a pleasure to use. It boots up in seconds (like less than 20), and has a lightning fast fingerprint sensor. My other laptop is a Thinkpad X1 Extreme, which I intended to be a powerhouse (32 GB RAM, i7-8850H, 4K, GTX-1080Ti Max-Q). Honestly, this laptop puts my \"powerhouse\" to shame in many ways. The Flex 14 boots up QUICKER, has less graphical errors when switching between desktops, and has a brighter back-light on its keyboard. Of course the Flex 14 can't run a virtual lab environment comprising of 4 machines like my Thinkpad Extreme, but it sure can run 2 VMs simultaneously (at least on the 12 GB RAM config). This laptop is SO good for the price I'm honestly shocked that it is not listed in the best laptops of 2019 list on YouTube or Google - its really a great find. Thank you Amazon! TLDR: This laptop is amazing. If you're a student, someone who seeks a 2 in 1 experience, a person who doesn't want to pay $800+ for a laptop and needs something portable yet powerful enough to get actual work done, this is the laptop for you.","I bought this to replace an Acer that was stolen, and the price of the Acer went up as I only bought it a few months ago. I went with this Lenovo Flex 14 Ryzen based on a similar model with 8 GB, and I decided to go with this model that had 12 GB based upon the possibility of running multiple programs at once. Some people may be starved with 8 GB, and 2 GB Vega 8 graphics being shared with it. So, based upon first impressions: \u2022 Easy setup. \u2022 Fast fingerprint scanner. \u2022 Excellent performance for the money with the following: \uf0a7 Video full HD 1080P, and I think most people have a hard time finding setting then put a bad review. The Ryzen has settings for different uses, so I\u2019d try to figure them out. It\u2019s not a gaming PC, but it has adequate video quality and is way better than Intel 620 HD integrated GPU. \uf0a7 Audio (it\u2019s clear and incredible) \u2022 Beats Surface Pro (I use one as a work computer). \u2022 Fast Charging. Downsides: Lenovo confusing and difficult registration process, although they do make it incredibly easy up buy extended warranty options, and it\u2019s more about the money than service it appears. \u2022 The stylus holder uses one USB port and blocks the use of the other ports. \u2022 It doesn\u2019t state to turn on or off backlight keyboard by using Fn + Spacebar to turn on or off (not so bad after someone knows), and the backlight doesn't dim automatically. \u2022 The plastic body feels a little cheap and flimsy. It can flex and bend a little, but it doesn't seem to be a problem. \u2022 4K video output only. I will return in few months if anything changes...","I was looking for a laptop to serve one purpose: notes and light work loads for college. Nearly any laptop can do that, but this one does it quite well for the price. I was looking for a laptop similar to the Surface Pro, or Surface Go. With the necessary accessories (i.e. pen and keyboard) both Surface products cost well over the price tag of this laptop, and even come with lesser specs. This CPU (Ryzen 3500U) is incredible for what I need this laptop for. As an engineering student, I'm certain it could handle programs like MATLAB, SolidWorks, and AutoDesk products.  Vega 8 graphics are good for regular use, but I wouldn't use it for gaming as I wouldn't want to max the thermals out, but Minecraft and Rocket League would run on low-medium if you absolutely need to. The laptop comes with a pen and USB holder for the pen, and the pen works great. It allows me to use my laptop as my notebook for all classes. Maybe this laptop is for you, and maybe you need something more higher end. PROS: -Sharp 14\" 1080p screen with great colors and great pen accuracy -Battery life easily lasts me 7 hours of use and the charger is very portable. -Slim, light form factor -Very fast, but it is new so I would expect that since it has an SSD. CONS: -Get the higher RAM model, the embedded graphics uses 2 GB of whatever RAM you selected and 6 GB is not enough for school use, 10 GB is though. -Keyboard has a very short travel, takes a while to get used to -Touch pad is mediocre -Pen sometimes has issues with the barrel buttons, very minor gripe. -Build quality is okay at best. Lots of plastic, some flex on the chassis and keyboard, but again, it's relatively cheap. No idea about the longevity of this laptop, but I guess I'll find out in the future. Mine shipped with a year and a half warranty so that is nice.  All-in-all, if you're on a tight budget, this laptop (Ryzen 5 3500U and 12 GB ram) will work great for school. If you have a budget larger than $600, opt for something like an HP ENVY x360. It has better hardware and overall quality.","Awful. I'm so mad I spent $549 + $100 (insurance) + tax on this piece of fecal matter. Pros: -Uses SSD, so it's fast. -Hinge is pretty sturdy after a few days. -Good keyboard layout. Cons: -WORST PEN AND PEN HOLDER IN HUMAN HISTORY. I can't get over how stupid this thing is. The holder is the worst: it takes away one of 2 full-sized USB ports itself, but if you want the pen to stay in the pen holder, you have to go horizontal which blocks both USB-A ports and the pathetic SD slot. Pen eats AAA batteries; why is it not rechargeable? It's supposed to be able to be stored vertically but the hole where the pen tip is supposed to rest and fit the pen tip in for stabilization is too far down and the pen just pops out. The pen is accurate but of the two buttons it has, only one seems to work (the right click). The other one seems to be there for decoration or confusing people. Absolute garbage. -SD card sticks so, so far out of the SD card slot: it's around 60-70% exposed. You will snap one of those eventually if you aren't super careful. I haven't, but I've only had it a few days. Why even have it if you can't even make sure the card isn't somewhat protected? -SSD is small. Only 256GB. -Various software issues including flickering and not being able to download apps, not being able to do side-by-side multitasking. -McAfee and Lenovo bloatware. Please **** yourselves for putting that in there. -Awful documentation. I had to go to the Device Manager to identify the NIC. Their own website doesn't even list it on the \"full\" spec sheet. -It didn't even run Netflix in Edge. It's a Windows machine that can't even do Netflix out-of-the-box. -I couldn't even install Linux Mint or Debian on it because it couldn't identify the Realtek NIC. If you're looking for a decent 2-in-1, look elsewhere. It's terrible.","Edit 10\/23: This is a very amazing product and I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the horrible wifi\/Bluetooth chip. Realtek 8822BE which is known to have many connectivity issues including constant drops of the wifi, slow speeds, or not even able to find any near by wifi altogether! It is even more sad that this product is sold directly from amazon and they can fix the issue themself. I had contacted Amazon customer support which referred me to Lenovo customer support which just wanted me to jump through hoops and wanted me to send them my laptop and said it would take 1+ weeks to \"fix\" the issue or I could pay 70+ dollars for them to do it faster. In truth it would have taken 1 month for anything to actually be fixed Did some research and found it faster and cheaper to buy a completely new wifi card (Intel 9260 no vpro), and installed it myself. It fixed the issue for the most part. So be ready to spend a bit extra if you want this laptop. But overall this is an excellent laptop and I do recommend buying it. Just be really to pay an additional 15ish dollars to get a better wifi chip to fix the issue.","If you're looking for the best of both build quality and performance for a reasonable price like I was, it's between this and the asus vivobook with an i5-8250u. The main pro of getting this however is the added graphical performance of the ryzen 5. I recommend getting the 12GB ram variant, it's the only one that makes sense unless you're looking to put in a 16GB sodimm. You wont be disappointed","I did a lot of research of a variety of 2 in 1 laptops. This laptop had great reviews. I was worried about the product until it came and all my fears were relieved. There was easy set up and far less bloatware than I have run into before. The details and descriptions were quite accurate and I am really happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone.","I'm a professional photographer, and needed a beefy, fast and affordable laptop to tether my camera to Adobe Lightroom for tethered shooting of portraits.  I went with the AMD Ryzen version with 12gb of RAM and 256gb SSD. Once I got set up and running, I installed Lightroom and tested a few tethered shots.  They imported quickly, which is exactly what I wanted.  Lightroom & Photoshop run well, so editing on the go is a breeze.  Plus, you can't beat booting from full powered off to into WIndows in under 10 seconds.  Battery life seems to be good, too.  Great little laptop for the money.","I BOUGHT THE LENOVO 12 GB STORAGE, ONLY TO RETURN IT NEXT DAY,  IT HAD A PROBLEM WITH CONNECTING VIA BLUETOOTH, WIFI KEPT GOING ON AND OFF,  SO WHAT GOOD IS A GOOD BARGAIN, WHEN I ONLY USED IT FOR A DAY,  I AM GOING TO BUY A MICROSOFT LAPTOP, COST MORE BUT WAY MORE DURABLE AND BETTER PARTS. NOT EVEN LENOVO TECH SUPPORT COULD FIX THE GLITCHES AND IT LOSING SIGNAL. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS AN AMZAON CHOICE","I legitimately believe that I've received a faulty or tampered with product. This computer is painfully slow and it's touch screen is the least sensitive screen I've ever used. I bought this as just a play computer to read news on and it's so incredibly slow I can't deal with it.","First off I purchased this as new only to get it and discover it was not. The laptop I received had a non functioning media card reader, strike 1, Strike 2 came in the form of a generic stylus that didn't work and strike 3 was the horrible battery life. The listing totes long lasting battery power 10 hours I got maybe 4 hours if use befor having to recharge, yes I charged it to 100% before inital use. Seeing as how all these things could be caused by it being used not new I opted for a replacement instead if a refund. I will give it one more tey and then make  final deciesion about it and update my review accordingly. Update #1While I am waiting for the replacement to arrive I figured I will try and use the laptop. So much for that. A picture is worth a thousand words in this case. This picture was taken after not even 2 days of use. I unplugged the laptop and it clearly shows 100% charge and says less than 3 hours remaining with the battery saver on.","As an IT pro - I require a machine that has the biggest balls possible. This laptop suffers from what we diagnosticians call ET (Extra Testicle). Simply put, this machine performs well and is a great value. I am beyond impressed with the build quality at this price point. The only think I am butt hurt about is not being able to play outerworlds on it - yet I can run VM's like a boss!!! Also the CPU is quite powerful - I have been doing video capture on this thing for a local non-profit video production. Pros: Does everything I want it to. Lighweight Sexy design Pen is fun touch screen is decent! Cons: Wish it had more ports, a USB-C break out box can remedy this so maybe file this criticism under neutral? Has 4 GB of RAM soldered to the board, and only has one slot for ram upgrades. This REALLY pisses me off as I'd like to replace the RAM and use dual channel mode to increase memory transaction speed and boost GPU perf. Speakers are weak - but god damn it could be worse!","Very unhappy with this product that I bought for my wife's birthday, to make her life easier. Instead it has made her life more difficult, and therefore mine. The main issues are: - The wifi constantly drops connection, in both home and work. - Cannot set up wifi printer at home - Generally slow I'm sure there are other issues too. This product is garbage. Do not buy this.","Terrible. IBM used to be great.","EDIT: The lag in krita is a well known issue. It can be fixed by going into settings. Search it in Google and it should tell you more details. I also switched the pen settings there from Windows to Windows Ink Pen and now, the program recognizes pressure sensitivity. I have edited a 1080 30fps video on Open shot while I had 6 tabs on Google chrome, not including the playing YouTube tab. It slowed down a bit but barely noticeable (unless you're really paying attention like I did.)  I exported the video and opened more tabs (I was mass downloading brushes for Krita.) This is such a huge upgrade to me. My previous laptop could never do this \ud83d\ude01 *old review below* Beautiful laptop! I bought this to upgrade my old hp laptop (traditional, 2gb ram, centron or idk whatever the spelling was, 500hdd) and this laptop can work as fast as I do. I open a program and it loads up immediately. There's also a powdery feel to the laptop. The screen is bright but I'm using it indoors. It's also glossy so writing with the pen is okay. It doesn't seem cheap, tbh. I had another intention for buying this laptop: for drawing and video editing. I tested gimp, sai and krita and only sai is buttery smooth. However, there's almost no pen sensitivity so I recommend getting an actual drawing tablet. But for note taking, this one will do the job. I don't have the WiFi connectivity issues. Bluetooth is working, too. I also have the same amateur \"demo\" picture on the sketchpad but I've read around and people say it's always there.","I have received some products from Amazon in the past that were easily returned when they arrived in poor condition, not working, etc. With this one Lenovo's support got involved and it was a nightmare. The Wi-Fi card in the laptop didn't work. I have worked in IT for quite some time. I updated drivers, confirmed Wi-Fi was working elsewhere without drops and even completely factory reset the laptop\/Windows. Eventually I got it returned... but this laptop functioned poorly and the custom support experience to return a malfunctioning product was a nightmare.","Compr\u00e9 por la descripci\u00f3n y luego encontr\u00e9 una Notebook completamente diferente, no tiene i5, no tiene 15.6', entre tantas otras cosas, por lo que la devolver\u00e9. Fue un enga\u00f1o para m\u00ed, con el agravante de p\u00e9rdida de tiempo al comprar y tener que volver a m\u00ed pa\u00eds sin nada por este problema. por favor publiquen bien sus productos","First gripe is my speakers have a deep rattle\/vibration sound that is very noticeable and makes sounds sound really distorted even if they arn't. Second is the very poor battery life. If i am watching a 1080P@60fps youtube video(and nothing else), the indicator shows only about 4 hours of battery life. Which is pretty bad for a 10 hour claim. Lastly the included pen holder blocks half of all of your ports. Overall i still think it is a good value. For having the performance and the nice body style, there is a lot on offer here. Im hoping my unit just has some defects. if i didn't have speaker or battery problems, i would recommend this laptop all day long.","cracked my old lenovo and the touchscreen wouldn't work so i decided to upgrade. This is used mostly for my college homework. I run multiple apps like word, my e-textbook, and chrome with like up to ten tabs open and it works fast.  This one is the newer model. It is much lighter than the 2017 one, it is a bit smaller too but same screen size which is nice. I had ordered a hard shell protective case for it, same brand that i had on my older laptop but it arrived and did not fit. So i have no case on it. This had led me to notice that fingerprints are super noticeable on the front cover. Kinda annoying but i am gonna try and put stickers all over it  The touchscreen works nice, i use it mostly as laptop but is nice when watching videos One thing that i have noticed is my WiFi on this computer seems spotty everywhere once in a while. Ive opened the same website on both my laptops at the same time and my older one with cracked screen loads pages faster. It works fast most of the time but slow speeds happen frequently enough to get a little annoying The battery life seems to last longer too, i haven't tested to see how long it would last me from 100% to being dead, but it takes like 4 hours to go down like 40 percent maybe, so that is nice. I still bring my cord with just in case i need to charge it. It would be cool if the USB c port in the laptop would charge it with a USB c cable but this laptop does not. The brightness is ok, I went into the display settings and manually turned up the brightness and tweaked with the settings to my preferred view. It is bright and colors are good. The sound is much louder and clearer on this model too which i really like. Great laptop by a great brand. I really like lenovo and will stick to their laptops","My pen didnt even come with a tip. Its flawless, no scratches just doesn't have a tip. What a RIP off","I purchased this to use at work and while I travel. I wasn't expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised. Battery life has been steadily above 8 hrs. which is more than enough for my needs. The screen folds to turn into a tablet configuration and it comes with a pen as well. My only wish is that the pen was able to integrate\/dock into the laptop itself and not require an attachable holder which takes up a USB slot, but at this price point I can ignore that. Touchpad is nice and responsive. I can't comment on the audio because I use it mostly with headphones, but I never expect much from laptop audio anyway. Overall, a fantastic laptop at the price point. I've already recommended it to a few friends.","This is a great laptop at a really good price. The hardware specs on this laptop is everything you would want in a home or office laptop that will get a lot of use. Boot time from Power on until Windows is only about 10 seconds. Really nice screen,dedicated video RAM & very smooth & fast when running multiple programs & sturdy 360 degree hinge. SSD and 12 GB of ram really help for video editing and multiple window\/applications. I have given this to my daughter for college and she loves it, mostly for tent mode for Netflix and Hulu. Battery life is good also when looking for a laptop i use the coast to coast method, if it can last an entire flight for est to west coast, this does it with battery to spare,","Great product with 1 medium and 2 minor issues. The largest issue is that the track pad has a difficult time differentiating between drag & double tap. So despite making all settings less sensitive, i had to disable double tap. Otherwise the battery lasts about 5 hours of moderate use a medium brightness, which is somewhat dissapointing. Lastly mccafee and lenovo keep asking me to buy mccafee. All in all, this is a versatile machine at a good price with a few drawbacks.","Been using this device for the past couple weeks without any issues. First thing I did once the Windows 10 configuration was complete was to install UbuntuStudio(Linux) along side Windows 10. Both operating systems run great on this laptop with a battery life around 4-6 hours. Primarily I run UbuntuStudio with my guitar plugged in(using GuitarRig Mobile USB), so that I can use Guitarix(Virtual AMP) and Hydrogen(drum machine). There is next to no latency when playing with the amp, drum machine and instructional videos running. I have also installed Docker on UbuntuStudio without any problems. When booted in Windows 10 I was able to run VirtualRC and Phoenix Flight Simulator without any lag. The package arrive 5 days after placing the order. Everything was sealed with the factory tape and the laptop worked flawlessly out of the box.","battery came in dead. the device didnt even connect to wifi. and now the seller is not approving the return even though I got a shipping label and the computer return is delivered. dont waste your time in buying this.","Great value for the price. High quality, fast specs, 12gb ram, SSD, and even the built in video card performs well for many games. Stuff like fortnite runs smooth. Don't expect ultra 8k and VR or anything but I was able to play some new games on this at surprisingly decent settings. If you adjust your brightness as low as you are comfortable with, even a few percent seemed to increase battery life quite a bit. I got 5 and a half hours on battery when web surfing and word document writing. I got a little over 2 hours on battery while playing a pretty intense game. The performance on this is pretty remarkable for the price.","I had been using a Chromebook for years as a basic web browser\/note taker for college, but I got this laptop hoping for a do-it-all kind of computer that fit within my budget. My friend and I kinda wanted to learn how to animate in 2D, so I also wanted something that could run animation software and video editing software (I use Krita and DaVinci Resolve), and the included pen plus the 360 hinge and touch screen seemed like a pretty good deal. I wasn't disappointed, as this laptop packs a lot of bang for buck. The Ryzen 5 3500U has plenty of power to run everything I need, and I haven't had any lagging issues at all. I'm not a huge PC gamer, but I did download The Long Dark, and the laptop runs it just fine.  The build quality is very good; it is mostly plastic, but it really doesn't feel cheap at all. I like the sort of matte finish, soft-touch material on the back of the screen, but it can get kind of fingerprint-y. I'm also no expert on pens for digital art or anything, but the one that was included feels nice and works well for me, and it's nice that it comes with a little holder for it too. Battery life and screen brightness aren't the best I've seen, but definitely adequate. Overall, I think this is one of the best laptops you can get new for around $550. I shopped around quite a bit at Best Buy and other websites, and for the price this thing comes very well-equipped.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone looking for laptop that has nice specs and doesn't break the bank. It's not just good for the price; it's an awesome laptop in general.","Tested this laptop under Linux and overall this laptop runs quite well (running Manjaro 18.1.0 & Kernel 5.3.6 and Desktop Environment is KDE Plasma 5.17). For playing less demanding games this laptop is somewhat capable (even some of the more demanding games can be played at lower settings). At $550 I would certainly recommend this laptop. Pros: - Touchscreen + Pen both work properly, although for a web browser like Firefox a couple of settings have to be adjusted for the application to support touch screen. - The keyboard is decent, not on par with Dell Latitudes or Lenovo Thinkpad keyboards but not too far from it and better than what most 2-in-1 convertible laptops offer in terms of build quality. No numpad though. - Battery life is decent as well considering this houses a low 45Wh battery. Likely due to power management working properly with the CPU since the HP Envy x360 15z (2017) with the R5 2500U had poor battery life in comparison. - The BIOS on the laptop has quite a few options such as disabling PSP (a feature I have no plans on using although I can't confirm if it actually does what it's suppose to). Most of the options I set to default although I set the laptop to performance mode when I plan on playing games. Cons: - When the Computer suspends from the battery life being very low (5%) and you resume, the touchscreen and mouse stops working until the system reboots, which is a bit of an inconvenience really, so I would keep the device above that low of a capacity if possible.","The rest of the product is great but it is useless if the wifi connectivity does not work.  Having read all comments on reviews here and on the Lenovo support group site, it is clear that it is almost impossible to get Lenovo to acknowledge it is a hardware problem (notwithstanding the vast number of similar complaints with only software solutions offered which don't work). To avoid wasting an enormous amount of time, it seems best to pay to replace wifi chip.","For the price this computer is amazing. The AMD processor Deets all the Intel processors at this price range. Especially when it comes to a graphical performance with AMD processor you can even play some light games like league of legends in CSGO. Also the AMD processor in\u2019s computer is better than toast because it is cheaper at roughly the same performance. Also the AMD version has 12 gigs of RAM compared to the eight gigs of RAM for the Intel for version. Also the AMD version comes with a free pen for you to be able to use it on the touchscreen. For the price this computer is really good.","I recently had a 2 n 1 with detachable keyboard bite the dust on me from the screen perspective.  Black friday lead me to this Lenovo Flex and I'm pleasantly surprised.  Screen is very good at full 1080p.  Of course it doesn't pop when compared to those that can display higher resolutions, but I won't knock the Flex for that.  Backlit keyboard and functional keys on keyboard are a huge plus.  Battery life is as advertised which is very useful not having to worry about plugging in every hour or so when on the go.  I haven't put it through it's paces yet to test out the RAM, but so far it has answered the call.  Fingerprint login and webcam privacy slider are welcome additions.  I travel more than average so I will give this laptop a good workout and update this review.","I bought this for the start of medical school and it had been great. It's fast, responsive, and does everything I need. Quick start up, backlit keyboard (that you can turn off), responsive touch screen, and great battery life (in power save mode). The pen works great, but I have no idea where to put the clip they supply with it...no big deal. I recommend getting a matte screen protector because fingerprints do show up a lot. Memory seems to be good for now, but the updates take a lot of space.","I mainly use this for school and drawing stuff. So far everything runs smoothly. Boots up fast and I don't think I ever experience lag. Installed ram on my laptop is telling it's 12 GB where 9.94 GB usable. The stylus that comes with it works well. Sometimes when I start to use it, it gives off a huge stroke. But it draws smoothly right after so it's a minor issue in the end. WiFi always connects smoothly, and having multiple tabs open isn't a issue as well. The only problem I experienced was my earbuds not working the laptop. It plays the sound from the computer. But I assume my earbuds' specific model is just not compatible with this laptop.","Review Perfect for me. I could not justify spending twice the price for the C930 just to have a dock-able stylus.  Note that a stylus is included with this device and it utilizes a USB dock. This AMD Ryzen 5 12RAM 256G device w\/Win10, stylus, and HDMI port (all included) was under $600 with tax. No brainer for a 2 in 1 touchscreen. I installed Chrome as I am a little more familiar with it and not the preinstalled Microsoft edge.  Chrome seems to work a little better with some software. I am a grad student and this more than serves my purpose when multi-tasking documents, websites, and programs.  I am not a gamer so have no info for that area.","So this laptop is great the 12GB of ram is nice and upgradeable the 256ssd is good also very quick the web cam is great better then most speakers are good they dont get loud but the are very clear the keyboard is nice and clicky I'm 90% sure the trackpads is a glass trackpads and that's amazing its also a nice size not to big not to small the only thing is battery life even the laptop will tell me at 100% on battery saving mode I have around 3 hrs so I'm not sure where they got 8 from","This laptop is INSANE VALUE. Lightning fast. Works great folded. The pen is so good. Everything is so good.","Value for $ is outstanding. I use mainly for on the spot photo editing. It handles Photoshop CS6 and Lightroom 5 with ease. Screen brightness is an issue -  as it is not very. It's okay indoors. Battery life for me is about 6 hrs of online browsing, photo editing and light video\/music streaming. Sound quality is fair- not loud or booming but not \"tin can\" treble-y.  I was overall impressed with features, speed, and power for a \"low end\" machine.","Firstly, my delivery was almost two weeks late. Kudos to Aramex. The laptop is very good overall. Good design, fast boot time, comes with Win 10 Home etc. But wifi is problematic. It isn't stable and works slower than it should have. The battery lasts about 4-5 hours for me. I'd also prefer a battery-free pen.","I bought this computer for my wife so far she loves it the only complaint we have is that the usbs aren't capable of supplying enough power for a docking station and a wireless keyboard at the same time.","Great laptop. Does what it says. The only thing is that the battery is terrible. It feels like I'm plugging in every 20 minutes. Only lasts if you always run it on power saving mode. Besides that I like it. Feels and looks nice","Pretty much I'm not satisfied. Battery life is half the amount stated. I'm hoping to get my full refund.","This laptop has so many features for the price it boggles my mind. Definitely the best price to performance laptop at the time being. It's a great all rounder. It feels sturdy, looks dashing and professional, and can even do some light gaming on the side. It's also a tablet. which makes it good for taking notes. You can also use it in the dark, because the keyboard is backlit. The only downsides I've noticed is that the battery life isn't optimal (although manageable) and there is some bloatware. I opted to do a fresh windows install on the machine myself. p.s. make sure you update the 3500u's drivers to get the most performance out of it in games.","I finally had to replace my 8-year old Lenovo Yoga, so I got what was the modern equivalent. After two months, I'm really happy with it. I write, do some audio production for radio and podcasts, and a little bit of graphic design. So far it does everything flawlessly.","Great laptop. It's fast, light, and great for students. I actually have one as a work laptop as well. I do wish there was 1 or 2 more USB ports on the other side. Keeping the pen in a usb port and having a dongle for an external mouse isn't very feasible.","Pen tip broke in the 1st 24 hours. Reported to Lenovo who said the pen (which came with it) is not covered under warranty and wants $10 to replace tip. Horrible.  Would not recommend!","Awesome quality and delivery! Bravo!","I thought is was too good to be true, and it was.  Performed poorly - sent it back.  Perhaps a lemon with a configuration problem?  Who knows?  I don't want to be on the help line forever trying to figure it out.","SSD works very good. do not know longer term reliability. Battery life is good generally (light weight has its down side). Can control battery life with screen brightness, much better life if you can stand a less brighter screen.","Only 1 cons, wifi Card is awful It disconects several times, for the rest the price is worth it","The laptop was literally sent to me without a CPU, error messages upon powering it on. Never felt so scammed in my life. On top of all of this it took two weeks to get a refund. SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE","I didn't find my invoice of how much I paid for. Also there was NO brochures of how to set my laptop. I had to ask somebody to help me. The only piece of paper we found was \"It's a great feeling\"!  To protect my investment???","I love this times 1000! The flexibility is great!! I live the pen feature and everything else about it! The price was a little high for me but over all it is totally worth a it!!","I bought this notebook last Black Friday. It is good overall. However, there are some fatal drawbacks. Unlike product information, short battery life is disappointing. It states that the average is 10 hours, but it is actually about 5 hours and 50 minutes. Moreover, the advertisement says it is new, but it is suspected of being used because there is a trace to remove the back sticker.","This 2 in 1 is superb. The touch screen is great along with the usability of the pen. The note taking through OneNote is amazing, you are able to take handwritten notes along side of typed notes. You are even able to insert documents, pictures, and videos if you like. I would highly recommend for college or high school students looking for an affordable laptop!","So far its really nice.  Bought for my wife.  She really likes it so far.","Just got this product today so I can\u2019t speak for it\u2019s long term performance. So far it is great! It looks fantastic with a high screen and speaker quality and is much slimmer than I expected. It is extremely fast and the setup is super simple. The stylus also works good. I am very happy so far!","Great laptop! Good value for the money, would buy again.","Although the screen is a bit dim and the brightness adjustment does not do much, the laptop is overall incredible for the price. For the amount of stuff, it can do with the flex and the pen and amazing hardware it is worth the money. It is incredibly fast and has great build quality and display. Very good laptop!","Love it!","Like that it is 2 in 1 and has a soft touch keyboard Turns on easily. Good choice after having to have factory reset on software with help from Lenovo and Microsoft. That was frustrating and time consuming.","I love this laptop.","Bastante pr\u00e1ctico, una pantalla decente, un buen procesador, un buen equipo por el precio que pagas.","I have zero complaints about this thing.

The keyboard is well spaced for larger hands, the track-pad works well, the pen feels nice to hold and the tablet mode has been exactly what I wanted from this device. The screen can be a bit over-responsive to touch commands when you place your hand\/arm on the screen to write but they have the option to disable the touch commands when writing so they've really addressed some of the problems with these things. My only complaints are the gloss screen is kind of undesirable for all the smudges and reflections it catches. It would be nice if they made a matte paper-like screen cover for this size screen. My other complaint is this is the first week I've had it and it already crashed and gave me this ominous \"Reset fTPM\" blue screen type notification. I went ahead and reset it and it seems to be working now, my data is fine too. Hopefully I'm not back to update things getting worse.","I brought a Lenovo laptop (thinkpad yoga s3).Need arrived to upgrade the wan card but Lenovo  have a bios whitelist with only some old cards that will only be allowed others won\u2019t even show up .Then problem occurred with the battery in which it recognize its battery as non genuine.CS asked to update bios, it won\u2019t update unless in battery above some percent ,says it is non genuine while it is factory fixed battery and pop up says it won\u2019t charge any non genuine battery, all help failed.Then I changed battery and updated with its charge, then again same thing happened and won\u2019t charge .bios is totally locked up and full of bugs.

Many people writing reviews on Amazon about their frustrations with certain Chromebooks are almost entirely confused about-- or unfamiliar with-- the OS, so they take it out on the machine. That's not fair or accurate. By way of background, I also need to explain that I bought a pair of ASUS C100PA-DB02 10.1-inch Chromebook flips with touchscreens back in 2015. They have very glossy\/shiny screens which glare, but the touch screen feature is nice. They also feature an actual aluminum metal chassis which is very elegant and classy looking (although prone to scratches). I saw this \"ruggedized\" version of a Chromebook on Amazon and thought I'd pick one up. I'm already an Asus fan, I like the Chromebook OS, and I was looking for a more durable Chromebook to literally throw in my backpack or briefcase and head out the door-- without worrying about a sleeve, case, or possible scratches if none of these was used. Well, this \"ruggedized\" version looks like it'd be great for children. Not so great for professional adults who've been spoiled with the nicer Chromebooks or laptops. I don't mean to be harsh because the chassis isn't awful, but it does have more of a look of Fisher Price or Leapfrog than Apple or PC. The Screen: The screen on this laptop is dimmer and more grainy (of that makes sense) than my other two laptops (both my other Chromebook and a PC laptop). The screen is anti-glare to be sure (a good thing), but you can sort of see a matrix pattern on the screen (a bad thing). The colors are also ever-so-slightly more washed out and dull. I compared all the screens side-by-side. If you're a student or a parent buying this for a child in grade-school, I don't think you'll be disappointed. If you're a photographer, visual artist, or someone who with a keen eye who enjoys HD movies, you'll notice that this screen is simply not up to par with other laptops on the market. The Keys: The keys on this laptop are my biggest frustration. While many keyboards today are back-lit, that would be a luxury on a Chromebook. Fair enough. But is it too much to ask for high-contrast silk screening? Maybe a phosphorescent or white print color for the keys? Apparently so. This keyboard has mid-to-dark-blue lettering on black keys. A really, really stupid choice that makes no scientific or practical sense other than to match the color blue to the \"ruggedized\" cover trim. These keys will be hard to see in low-lighting. Lastly, the keys on this keyboard are noticeably taller than on my other Asus Chromebook. Probably twice as tall. You feel like you're typing on a manual typewriter. Very poor design choice. Summary: If I were a parent, I'd buy my kid this laptop in a heartbeat. It's compact, durable, water-resistant, has excellent battery life, access to the Internet, if used with Google Drive and Google Docs all work is saved and backed-up automatically, the laptop is somewhat immune to viruses, and it's certainly rugged. However, if I were a college student and wanted all the above *plus* the ability to really enjoy streaming movies and to comfortably type-up term papers for hours on end, I'd probably get a Chromebook with a nicer screen and better keyboard. Sadly, for me, this laptop was a no-go and I'll be returning it. Sticking with the aluminum Asus 2-in-1 with touchscreen. If you found this review, please give me a thumbs up. Cheers.","This is a very solid feeling unit, unlike many inexpensive Chromebooks. All the reviews are spot on about performance and battery life. I take exception to the comments about this unit (or any Chromebook) being \"limited.\" Google \"install Ubuntu on Chromebook\" and follow the instructions, and you will have a fully functional Linux computer. Install LibreOffice for your office suite, Gimp for photo editing, Audacity for audio recording and editing, and any other Linux applications you want. Put a 64 GB SD card in the slot for all your data. You will have a computer that is more secure than any Windows computer, costs a small fraction of any Mac computer, and can do pretty much anything you want. The world of Linux software is amazing, and it is all free, OK, so it can't manage your iPhone, but it can do darn near anything else. All for under $200. I do not see myself going back to Windows or Mac ever.","Great little device for writing.  I am a writer and I needed something simple without a lot of bells and whistles and whips and chains :)  This little Chromebook netbook is awesome for traveling.  It takes a little bit to get used to Chrome's operating system, but once you do you'll discover some very nice proprietary advantages. A small\u2014but nice thing\u2014is not having to right click any more; instead, you simply tap with two fingers for word corrections.  This is great for someone like me who writes a lot and needs to have a simplified workflow. The battery is long lasting and the keyboard is a perfect size, even for someone as big as I am. 6'3\" 300. Because I use google docs to write with, this seemed a natural step. Chromebook seamlessly integrates Google Docs, and most other important apps into the framework of the little machine, so it's very easy to use and get started. The offline stuff is very useful too as I'm not always in a place where there's wifi and I can still work on my books. Another nice feature is how light it is.  My wife bought a laptop a couple years ago and she would share it with me (begrudgingly) and I always hated working on it because it was big, heavy, and clunky.  This little Chromebook weighs next to nothing and is easy to tote around. All in all, I'd give this 10 stars if I could\u2014especially considering the price. Disclaimer - shameless self-promoting in the photo :)","49 year old 3D designer here. I was looking for a light weight solution to get me out of my office when I just needed to use the internet, google docs etc. Figured for $200 it would just be a nice little cheap toy. This thing is pretty amazing. Nice keyboard, decent screen, great webcam (to use mostly with Hangouts) good speakers  and its really fast. I watched about 4 hours of videos on battery and it only went down to 79% full. Solid unit, very happy with purchase.","This Chromebook hardly needs another review but I've just been so happy with it lately I thought I'd throw my two cents in here. *For a Chromebook* this device is fantastic. Of course it's limited in many, many ways, but that's the whole point of buying a Chromebook. I've been using this device for a little over half a semester in college for in class note taking, group work, etc. I use my desktop for any heavy duty stuff. It's worth noting that I rollerblade to classes, so I was looking for something as light as possible and as durable as possible. Pros: Very sturdy - I've dropped it many times and the worst that has happened is the rubber edging will have to be popped back into place. Simple as that and it feels totally firm and solid once it's back in place. It's great to not have to treat your laptop like the slightest bump could damage it. Fantastic keyboard - The keyboard has a nice \"chunk\" with each keystroke. The keys have enough travel and require enough force to avoid accidental keystrokes and typing feels great, even satisfying. Great battery life - I never bring my charger with me anymore, no matter how long I expect to be out. Good sunlight readability -  The screen does a pretty fine job of reducing strong glare. Cons: Weight - Though it's not particularly heavy for a Chromebook, its weight is a significant addition to my backpack. At just over two pounds, however, it's not a huge compromise in return for how durable this machine is. Sometime slow - As you'd expect. But honestly Chrome does a good enough job of managing resources that I only notice severe lag when opening presentations with many elements in them. All in all, this Chromebook has exceeded my expectations!","Great Chromebook! Bought as a replacement for my Lenovo Ideapad 310, AMD A12, 8GB Ram. The main reason for the replacement was battery life. Only getting 2-3 hours on the Lenovo, I needed something that could handle my digital nomad lifestyle. PROS: Battery Life - You can easily get 8-9 hours with moderate usage. Performance - I was a tad bit concerned with this factor, but with: ----- 21 tabs open ----- Keypress Editior (coding app from Chrome Store) ----- Webserver for Chome (running a local server for web dev, from Chrome Store) ----- Box SVG (creating & editing vector graphics app from Chrome Store) ----- Polarr (a really good image editior from Chrome Store) ----- Enjoy Music Player (another Chrome Store app) I haven't experienced any significant slow downs. Opening large SVG files or any other larger file, slows the system for a second or two (acceptable). Keyboard - I love typing on this keyboard. Even though it's smaller than my Lenovo, I type faster. Keys are well spaced and feel good to press. Also the key font size is a small aesthetic that you'll appreciate. Build Quality - I won't lie, it's ugly, but it feels very solid in hand. I'm not moving it around like it's a new born baby, as I was with my Lenovo. I can quickly take it out my backpack and slap it on a desk. All the ports feel strong and sturdy. My flash drive does not wiggle while inserted. Screen - It's good for the price, nice matte finish. I haven't had the urge to go back to my Lenovo (15.6) to watch a video or movie. It gets bright and dim to my satisfaction, nuff said. Charge Time - A fast charging device wasn't on my feature list, but this baby is fully charged from 35% in less than 1 hour. Better than my lenovo...I'll take it. Trackpad - It does what I expect and is perfectly placed. My only gripe is how loud actual clicks are, everyone at Starbucks will know when you double-click. Chrome OS - FYI, I'm coming from Ubuntu Desktop. From a bird's eye view Chrome OS may seem limited, but once you dig around the Chrome Store, you'll start finding apps for all your problems and fairly decent app replacements. Furthermore, there are a plethora of web apps outside the Chrome Store to compensate most people's unique necessities. Chrome OS + Google Play - In my opinion these two paired eliminate the \"OS Limits\". If you ever used Android, then you'll know there's an app for everything. I personally haven't even needed the Play Store yet, so I actually disabled it. Storage - I thought this would be an issue, but Google Drive is integrated very well. You get 120GB free for 2 years. You can also expand your local memory with SD card or flash drive. I always keep a flash drive backup. Speakers - As you can tell, I'm not super picky. These speakers get the job done, better than my Lenovo. I don't find myself plugging in my headphones to hear things better as I do with my phone and laptop. They get loud enough for me. Wifi - This was another huge issue I had with my Lenovo, mainly because I was using linux. Asus definitely delivers, connections are always strong and never drop. I'm using this Chromebook in the same locations as I did with the Lenovo. Bluetooth - I couldn't get it to connect with my phone. The pair would instantly drop. I haven't looked for a solution. I sure a bluetooth mouse or headset will work. It's well documented that not all phones pair with Chromebooks. Weight & Portability - It's nice and small, easy to carry around in hand as well as light on the back. Has a great rubber strip on bottom, that not only holds grip on tables and laps better than any other laptop I've owned, but allows it to be carried around like a spiraled notebook. Love Factor - It may be ugly, but I just love using it. It can do more than my phone and suitably replaces my laptop. Easy to carry around, not fragile, well built. It's the perfect piece of technology to augment yourself. Overall: Battery Life = 10 Performance = 9 Keyboard = 10 Build Quality  = 10 Screen = 8 Charge Time = 10 Trackpad = 8 Chrome OS = 9 Storage (cloud) = 10 Speakers = 8 WIFI = 10 Bluetooth = no contest Weight & Portability = 10 Love Factor = 10 TOTAL  122\/130  (excluding bluetooth) --------------------------------  94% Chance I think you'll like this Chromebook","This chrome book only lasted three and a half months. The battery will not hold a charge, apparently this is a common problem with this model. I bought this from Amazon warehouse. I have always been happy with my purchases through them, but this time it didn't work out.","it doesnt have a caps lock button but thats okay because i probably shouldnt be yelling at people over the internet anyway","We bought this for our daughter as required for high school.  It had great reviews and had a good price.  She has used this for less than 2 months, and it is kept in a neoprene pouch between classes and when not in use.  Last week, a defect started to appear on the upper left portion of the screen, that has now progressed to a third of the screen blocked out and unusable.  There was not an impact or damage to cause this.  It is essentially non-working at this point.  I called ASUS to check about the warranty.  I was told that I had to pay the shipping to send it back, it would be gone at least 7-10 business days, and the manufacturer would deem if it was \"manufacturer defect or user damage.\"  If it was deemed damaged, we would be responsible for all repairs. After the phone conversation, I have no confidence that this company would take responsibility for it's defective product. I will not pay the money for shipping just for them then say it was damaged, when in fact it wasn't.  Please, save yourself $200 and buy another product by another manufacturer.  You might be lucky and get one that works, but then again, you may not and you will just be out $200 like we are.","This little Chromebook is the best computer I have had in awhile. Setup is super easy and it runs incredibly fast. Many other computers take at least 2-3 minutes before I can do anything with them, but not this one! I can immediately get online and access documents without waiting or getting frustrated. The speakers are pretty good for the size of the computer, nothing super loud or anything, but definitely good and clear sound. The keyboard's letters are a light blue color and bigger than most other's. That does not make a very big difference to me, but it would help someone just learning how to use a keyboard or whose vision is not too great. I personally am not a huge fan of the touch pad because most of the time it is difficult or impossible to left click anything, but that was easily solvable by using a small, portable wireless mouse. It does effortlessly keep track of social media notifications, especially Facebook, which is a good but not overall necessary feature, at least for me. It has a good design and definitely would hold up to short distance drops or a little bit of water. I often take this to school and at times it sits in my hot car, but it always manages to work great when in use. My favorite feature of this computer? The battery life. Hands down, the battery life on its own is unbeatable. It lasts at the very least ten hours and I can get anywhere from 3-5 days use on one charge. I no longer need to take my charger out with me and worry whether or not there is an outlet nearby.","I bought this for my 6yr old son who just began exploring the gamer world of minecraft. When come to find out, Chromebooks DO NOT support minecraft software, therefore I was completely devastated. I looked online for some guidance to see how I could go around this but all I found was the option to turn my brand new computer into what is called Developer Mode where I would be, in theory, reprogramming Its main functionality by installing a second Operating System called Lenux. Of course I wouldn't even dare since A. I have not the slightest knowledge how to Code (wish I did though) B. Tampering with it voids warranty. C. Id be pursuing a theory because it may work for some but not for others leaving no guarantee that tweaking it would even work. So finally, distraught since the ONLY reason I purchased this beautiful and economical piece of work was for my son to play minecraft, I gave up!! Only to wake up the next morning relentlessly reviewing the options I had when suddenly.... A new chrome is update! Chrome books can now use Android games and apps through Google Play. And with that came.... MINECARFT: Pocket-sized edition A big breath of fresh air!!!!! Now onto the actual hardware. It's very light, the color is true. The keyboard is perfect! Screen could be a bit more defined but it does the trick. Great little piece of work!! Highly recommend","Can't write a good review, had it on for about 5 minutes and it locked up. Finally got it to turn off and when it came back on all we got was a black screen.","The laptop worked fine for 6 months until the LCD screen 'broke' after watching videos for 2h. Part of the screen no longer showed anything, it just stayed white. Sending in the laptop for warranty (shipping needs to be paid!) turned out to be a big mistake. ASUS apparently has an exclusion in their warranty for anything that 'breaks'. If the technician hasn't 'been advised of there being a known issue\/defect of that sort' the claim is denied. Funny isn't it, this way they never have to fulfill a warranty claim unless they have experienced the same problem in their lab, or they know they used inferior material somewhere, or? The whole reason for going with this laptop was their slogan of the laptop being 'rugged', thus a long lasting product which turned out to be a total scam. Don't get me wrong, if there would be a hole in the screen or a dent on the chassis, or water in the laptop, or anything clearly indicating an external force, i.e. stupid me breaking it, I am all for denying a claim, but this way, not acceptable. Just bought another Samsung Chromebook 3 to replace this ASUS fiasco. The old one is now running for almost two years without problems in the hands of someone not always taking good care of it, that's 'rugged' without falsely bragging about it.","We bought this for my husband to replace his current laptop. It is also starting to take the place of his tablet too. He loves the versatility of the Chromebook. He can use it to work and the kids can watch movies on it. The battery life is long and the display is very nice. It is ruggedized as advertised which is definitely a great feature with two children tearing the house apart on a daily basis.","I've been a chromebook fan for years. Because we travel a lot I wanted a more ruggedized model. I'm more than happy with this device. And the battery has been lasting for a full 10 hours. Very impressive.","I ordered this in June 2017. It worked until July 2017. I noticed some minor problems right away with my documents opening on their own and had to reset the laptop to factory settings. I had to reset twice. Today, I turned on the laptop and it showed the startup screen (white screen with the word \"Chrome.\") It then went black and blinked the startup screen again. It keeps going on and off. It worked for a little less than a month and a half. I'm returning it. It would have been a great little laptop if it had worked.","Well, I suppose I'm not super computer savvy but I spend a lot of time on computers and I know what I like. My wife and I own a Dell desk top computer which we share between the two of us. I'll be going back to school in the spring and we thought it might be nice to have an extra computer around the house so we could both work on projects, or watch videos, or whatever at the same time. Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of money to spend so I really did my research before purchasing. I spent less than $200 for this little Chromebook and I think I really got my money's worth. With the exception of the storage capacity (which can be easily upgraded with an SD Card), it seems to be on a par with MacBook Air but for less than a third the cost. It's fast, easy to use, light weight, and durable. The last two qualities are especially important to me because I'm a cyclist and a strap hanger. If you travel primarily by automobile, you can't fully grok how important it is for someone who travels primarily by bicycle and\/or bus to pack light and have durable, water resistant gear. It isn't mentioned in the product description, but I was pleasantly surprised that this Chromebook came with a 12 month accident protection warranty. To me that says a lot about Asus' confidence in the durability of their product. Admittedly, I am a big time Google user. I've had a gmail account for years and I use all the wonderful products - Drive (docs, sheets, slides, and drawings), Voice (both phone and sms), Hangouts, Keep, Calendar, etc - that google has. If you're like me in this you'll be very happy to see that this Chromebook is a natural extension of your blissful Google experience. One thing I would strongly recommend to anyone who decides to purchase this product is that you explore the help (?) section soon after you start it up for the first time. This is a Chrome OS so its slightly different than a Mac or Windows OS and will take a little getting used to. It's very intuitive and user friendly but you'll save yourself a lot of frustration if you take an hour to learn how to use it. All in all, I think this is an extraordinary product and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive, very portable computer for school or work. In fact, we liked it so much, we bought a second one for my wife. :-)","I ordered two of these for my homeschooling children. This computer was great for the couple of months that it worked.  We did all the right things.  No computer on laps or beds...It just turned off one day and simply would not turn back on.  It won't even charge.  My son had his replaced after only a week of use and his won't turn on now either.  3\/3 bad laptops is too much.  I would avoid this.","For the price and the specs its a great chromebook...the problem is that the hardware is faulty. After about a month's worth of use, it randomly shut off one day. I have yet been able to turn it on. I am thinking it might be the power adaptor. I am going to test it later today. Regardless, after searching in the comments for similar issues, this seems to be persistent with this product. They should do a recall on this product or offer free hardware repairs since this is a very common issue.","I ordered it in June. It's only about 3 months old and it randomly just shuts off. Screen goes black, and has to be restarted. Then it sometimes does it again! I understand it's a cheap computer, but it's not really worth the aggravation.","As I read review after review on this product, I'm appalled at the number of buyers that purchased this machine apparently clueless as to what it is! This is a Chromebook and runs Chrome OS, which is primarily intended for web based computing. You cannot compare this to a Windows PC\/laptop because it's completely different. If you educate yourself first to understand the software, functions, and limitations of the product, you can make an informed and wise purchase. As for me, I love it! It's a great compact size, is fast as lightning, runs Android apps (after switching the OS to the Beta channel) flawlessly, and works well with USB drives, memory cards, Bluetooth devices, and more. The lightweight footprint of the operating system is a plus because it boots and computes faster than most Windows laptops. The design of the device is rugged and feels very well made. In summary, I did my homework before I purchased so my expectations for it were realistic- and it has exceeded! I definitely recommend this device to those who understand what a Chromebook does and cannot do.","Speed is fast. Plays movies in HD, (ie. NETFLIX is playing in the picture). Super durable, my nephew has dropped it multiple times and still works as new. I definitely recommend this is you're looking for a Chrome Book, instead using a laptop. To my father it does more than he uses it for. It also has a decent front facing camera that actually has good quality. We've Skyped on it many times. If you're not a gamer, video editor or a power user of Microsoft excel, ect. - this Chrome Book is for you.","This chromebook seemed great at first.  We used it for the last ten months a couple hours a day at a desk plugged into wall power.  When we tried using it without being plugged in, we found it won't even boot.  If you unplug power when it's running, it dies immediately as if there's no battery at all. The next problem is that when you do boot the chromebook plugged in to wall power, about 50% of the time the screen flashes bright and then goes all black.  If you close the cover and try booting it again, it may do the same thing or it may work that time. Overall, this is the most unreliable chromebook we've tried and very disappointing for an Asus product. Update: After sending the chromebook to Asus for warranty work and Asus saying they completed the repairs, it still has the same problems as before.  The warranty experience with Asus has been extremely disappointing.","Simple and straight forward. No bells , whistles or widgets. Perfect no nonsense laptop for school. 10hr battery. Super lightweight but durable. Perfect for my online college classes. Math, chemistry and biology. Documents are super easy to download, edit, convert , send etc. Automatically saves when using Google documents. No annual fee for making documents. Word documents are easily downloaded and Google docs can be converted to a word document. Super fast, doesn't take time to load or shut down. Make sure to fully charge before the initial start up but after that it's good to go. Doesn't take long to charge. I also got a Logitech wireless mouse for the computer and it worked perfectly. However I do not use this laptop for streaming or gaming. I have other devices for that stuff.","I bought this chromebook strictly for nursing school. Battery Life: (My school has like 4 outlets for the whole class, so it's sadly a first come first serve type of deal just to charge your laptop (that you're required to have in the program but not provided for you; lame) Anyways, It is AMAZING and has exceeded my expectations. The reason I wanted a chromebook was for the battery life and simple light design. This chromebook has a very long battery life I use it during school and work and usually only charge it once or twice a week at most.I use it usually max to almost max brightness and it lasts all day and I don't have to worry about needing to plug it in all the time. Lightweight and compact: It is lightweight and compact and I barely feel it when I put it in my bag or on my lap. I hold it in my hand with ease. At work I don't even need use it on a desk, just on my lap because it's small and comfortable enough. Furthermore, the ruggedized design makes it really protected, yet the thing is so light, I feel very safe if I were ever to drop it mostly because it doesn't weigh like other laptops. The ruggedized design, is strong I'm sure, but it's more like icing on the cake. Speed and processor: I have no issues with speed and opening multiple windows whatsoever. It handles multiple open windows no problem, which I was worried about when I read other reviews. It was almost never lagged on me except once or twice when I opened a big e-textbook with hundreds of pages. It actually starts up and opens programs f*cking fast. I turn it on and it's fully on within a couple seconds. It doesn't seem to need to load ever which I am still am in shock about. It's super convenient. Overall, this is probably the best damn thing I ever bought from Amazon. It's a God send for nursing school and studying at work. I even bought one for my mom.","Arrived seemingly in good condition. When powered up it functioned for about 2 minutes, then froze -- keyboard, trackpad, everything. Only holding the power button down to reboot would give any result.  Same thing happened a few more times: it would seem to work from a few seconds to a minute or so, then at some random point would lock up. This was the second time I ordered this Chromebook from Amazon; The first one, along with a separate unrelated shipment, was stolen, or otherwise just never showed up for some reason. Not ASUS's fault of course... But then this second one is delivered and... didn't work. This was certainly just a single bad unit. I could've, and probably should have, contacted ASUS to get everything straightened out, but I was a bit frustrated at this point, and just went out that night and picked up a different laptop at a local Big Box. I was able to send the frozen one back to Amazon for a quick and courteous refund.","I loved mine. Got it in December and used it just about daily. Perfect for me. However, yesterday I spilled coffee and it got in the keyboard and it immediately stopped working. The unit would turn on, but the screen remained black. It's totally my fault, no blame to the company or product, but watching him pour that mug of water on the keyboard made me cringe. I'm not sure how \"waterproof\" it is. I'm also not sure I could spill the coffee again like I did, so it was a freak accident. Anyway, I ordered another 10 minutes after the spill. So, I guess you could say I'm pretty happy with it.","I love this Chromebook have been looking at it for a long time and read every review, I'm so glad I finally decided to order it. I have had my laptop for a long time and I also have a tablet but wanted something in between those sizes and this Chromebook is perfect. It came very well packaged and I unpacked and went right to work with it. Very user friendly and easy to set up! I will say the only thing I don't like about it is the blue letters on black keys makes it hard to see in low light. Other than that I love and it's perfect for my needs. The shipping was very fast on it, thanks Amazon!","We've been using this little guy for about a month now and we're impressed. It doesn't feel laggy, the screen resolution is sufficient, and it just feels sturdy and rugged, while remaining lightweight. The keys have a decent feel to them and don't feel crowded. The apps run fine and synching with Google services such as Calendar and Keep is great. Network connection speeds are smooth. This really has been a great buy.","Light but solid, responsive, pretty good keyboard, impressive battery life. Do you want to surf the web, do your email, watch internet videos, write the Great American Novel, video chat, teach yourself how to create web pages, AND not worry about destroying a $1,000+ piece of electronic equipment with a 7-11 Big Gulp? I think you may be hard pressed to get more bang for your buck than this gadget right here.","For $200, this is a really impressive machine. The battery life is great, the keyboard is comfortable and easy to use, the screen is pretty vivid, and for web browsing it's difficult to tell the difference between this Chromebook and my primary laptop, which cost five times more. Basically, if that's all you plan to use this for--YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, anything you can access in a web browser--it's a five star product hands down. The problem is everything else: once you're away from the Internet it becomes a $200 brick. If you plan on doing any kind of document or spreadsheet, you need to go through Google Docs. Assuming it works perfectly, you need to wait about 20 seconds between clicking to open a document and actually being able to edit it. Sometimes it doesn't work perfectly, you need to log back into your account. Sometimes you try logging in and it doesn't work for some reason. Then it completely freezes, so you need to close Chrome and try again. Then you finally get logged into Google Docs, you start writing your document and have a bad Internet connection for whatever reason. The second the Internet is gone, your document is frozen--can't change anything, can't copy or paste anything, nothing. Sometimes it does this even when the Internet connection doesn't seem to be suffering any problems. There's supposedly an \"offline mode,\" which stops that from happening. but only for one of your devices at a time, and after hours of effort I could not get it to work with this thing in any case. In one instance, between me opening Google Docs it took a full FIVE minutes of clicking and dealing with problems before I could get access to a document I needed--and that was on a good Internet connection. Once it actually works it's great, the problem is getting to that point.","I am a 50 yr old father to 7 kids. I am also a IT professional. I have been working with computers for more than 20 years.  But believe it or not, I still get hung up on curent techology from time to time. With that being said, I think I have a good feel for what is worthwile in the tech area.  I can say, this is a good buy. I have to preface it however as what do you plan to do with it. If you plan on video editing, this is no good. If you want to watch videos, this is great. If you want to play fortnite, this will not be any good. If you want to play farmtown on facebook, this will work great.  Its an excellent little laptop, that really isn't a laptop, but behaves a lot like one.  one of my kids uses this for her homework, and it is perfect. Her school books this year are all on line. The school provides office 365 for the kids. She brings it to school with her everyday, and she is very happy. Most of her friends all have a chromebook, and everyone says they like hers the best. This one is very sturdy and feels firm in your hands. The keyboard has a great feel - when you press keys, it has a nice click to it. Requires a good amount of pressure to type, but not too much. The battery life is great, easily lasts the entire day. Not heavy at all, its easy to carry around all day. For a teenager, its absolutely perfect. It is rugged, and water resistant, and somewhat immune to viruses.  Admittedly, we are big time Google users. We have had a gmail accounts for years and we use all the wonderful products - Drive (docs, sheets, slides, and drawings), Voice (both phone and sms), Hangouts, Keep, Calendar, etc - that google has. If you're like me in this you'll be very happy to see that this Chromebook is a natural extension of your blissful Google experience. However if I had to say anything negative, to me personally it almost looks like a toy.  More like fisher price or a leap frog, rather than an Apple of HP. So if you are a business proffesional and would have a hangup on something like that, you may want to consider a different style. But for functionality and price, you really can't beat it.  Here is one tip for you, if you have never used Chrome OS before One thing I would strongly recommend is that you explore the help (?) section soon after you start it up for the first time. This is a Chrome OS so its slightly different than a Mac or Windows OS and will take a little getting used to. It's very intuitive and user friendly but you'll save yourself a lot of frustration if you take an hour to learn how to use it.  I am considering buying a second one for me. This is what I plan on doing. I am sure you could install Ubuntu on it, and get myself a 64gb sd card, and I will have a fully functioning Linux computer. Linux software is all free, and much more reliable than windows. There is free office, free photo editing, free audio software. This machine has more than enough power to do all that !","Perfect.  There's no better description.  It has a slot for my usb Verizon connection to the internet.  It has a slot for the dongle (?) for my full-sized mouse. It's light weight. Fully charged it seems to hold that charge for quite a while. I couldn't be happier.  And the price was reasonable. If you, like me, don't need a lot of \"stuff\" on a computer,  this is it. But it even has a memory card slot and built in camera.","I bought two of these a few months ago, now both have been sent back to ASUS for repair. Both will no longer charge the battery.  I attempted two different charging cords. ASUS repair in Texas has still not fixed the power issue, Still waiting on parts after 30 days Both of mine had issues about 9 months into the warranty. I think they are seeing many of these show up with a similar problem..","My ruggedized ASUS Chromebook arrived very quickly and was very easy to get hooked to the inet. The price was very low, compared to laptops using other operating systems, and it has been amazingly fast, smooth, and stable. Since it updates its programming and safety systems constantly (every time you turn it on), it's as though you have a brand-new computer every time you turn it one. And Google does all the tiresome updating and housekeeping that make other systems so tiresome to use.....with this Chromebook, you just sit down and go to work, or start playing, no fuss, no bother. And I love the way it sounds through my Cambridge Soundworks powered speakers - just stick the stereo miniplug into the ASUS' headphone jack, and beautiful music comes out (I STRONGLY recommend three musical geniuses on YouTube: Tatyana's Guitar Quartet (Libertango); Guillermo Murrieta (Samba Pa Ti); Brittni Paiva (Lights). They all sound fabulous on this ASUS! My ASUS Chromebook has truly spoiled me, with its fast, smooth, no-fuss operation.","Slowed to a crawl after a month After leaving my previous job and turning in my lightning-fast MacBook Air, I purchased a refurbished MacBook Air that was slow as molasses.  I returned that as it was wasting my time, and got this Chromebook instead.  It worked well for about a month and then it too began to load pages maddeningly slowly.  To give you an example:  I can't even use Google maps because the maps won't load.  I researched everything you are supposed to do to increase speed:  disabling unused extensions, not keeping too many tabs open, and disabling some plug-ins (which unfortunately Chrome no longer allows you to do).  I stopped short of a powerwash:  Why should I need to do that after I've had the computer a little over a month?  I suspect I may have gotten a faulty model and wish I could return it, but amazon's return policy is only 30 days. An additional problem is that the battery life is quite poor--only a fraction of the advertised 10 hours.  And I did fully charge and discharge it on the initial charge.  I think I just got a defective unit.","So... I have a boat on the coast, about three hours from where I live.  I typically am very good about making sure I have my classic Windows Based lap top with me at all times, because of my work.  I just never know when I'm going to need to make a change to our website or utilize a Manufacturer's website portal.  Well.. Last weekend, I forgot my laptop and I desperately needed one... FAST.  I went to Staples and saw a Chromebook and was very skeptical.  In the store, I was able to access the website that I needed to work from.... Unfortunately, the Sales Person at Staples was 1) too lazy to see if the particular model that I was using in the store was available and 2) Actually told me that I would not be happy with this purchase and would likely return it and suggested that I shouldn't buy it... So.. I didn't. Instead, I borrowed a typical Laptop form someone and completed my work. I was still intrigued by the chrombook idea... So, I got on Amazon and found this little guy.. I figured that the water resistance on the keyboard might be helpful one day with the machine being primarily for the boat.  I also liked the rugged rubber on the outside.. I was concerned at first about the notion that this was a Student Machine... But... In reality, students are probably WAY ahead of me in computers at this point. I ordered this machine and in two days it arrived.  I LOVE it!  I am on the boat now typing and listening to Spotify on the machine at the same time.  It runs all of the programs and emails that I need for work and it is super light and easy to carry around.  It takes some time to get acquainted with some of the Chromebook processes and use features... Some are similar to standard PC but many are not.  I was very frustrated when some applications or websites wouldn't scroll down.. Then somebody showed me how two fingers on the touch pad at the same time allows for scrolling of any page. I have been able to access all spreadsheets that are emailed to me and open every business email or program.  I am going to keep using this as my primary machine until I find an application that I cannot do.  My biggest issue now is that this was designed to be left on the boat for emergency use, but I find it so easy to use and practical that I will likely be taking it home... Also, it operates very fast and I have had none of the issues with the touch pad or with slow operation that some people have mentioned in the reviews.  When you open it, it is ready to go.  No waiting for it to boot up or anything like that. I highly recommend this.","I bought this chromebook and after using it for a week I bought the same model for my parents. As of June 1st you can install Android apps on this particular Chromebook (as of June 20th it still requires a switch to the Beta version of the Chrome OS). Hence you can run Skype, Celtx, Excel, Google Inbox or other non-browser apps of your choosing. Now, I do have a 17-inch high-end ASUS Windows-based laptop, but still this very Chromebook became my primary machine. I keep carrying the C202 around where ever I go -- beach, office, park, bed, and so on. I get all the apps I need, I get all the battery life I need, and I stay light and mobile. If you are thinking about which Chromebook to get I doubt you will go wrong with ASUS Chromebook C202SA-YS02.","(Pros) Durable (feels sturdy) Exterior looks good but not too flashy Light weight Decent battery life CPU seems good, doesn't freeze up with a few browsers tabs open Keys on the keyboard are large and blue, easy to read and type on. Touchpad is responsive and works well inexpensive, for the specs this is one of the best bang for you buck deals on a Chromebook (Would be nice) It would be cool if there was a version that had a back lit keyboard or touchscreen but I don't mind since it's lighter and has a better battery life this way. (Cons) What I really wish this Chromebook had was a better screen, it has poor contrast and my eyes get tired if I look at it for an extended period of time.  It looks really poor when viewing from any angle other than straight on. If this Chromebook had a 1080p screen it would be pretty much perfect.  If they offered one with a 1080p screen I would buy it right now.","It is nice looking and durable; I have accidentally lightly dropped it several times from the couch to the floor, nothing was broken; however, when using chrome for a long period of time, the screen  would blacken for a little while and back to normal.","This Chromebook work well but do not go by the video shown.  It shows a person pouring water into keyboard with no damage; dropping it from a table top to the floor with no damage.  Says it is an \"easy fix\" if something does go wrong, just pop the damaged part out and pop a new one in.  This is a lie!  If it shows any sign of 'physical damage' your warranty is void.  I just paid 210.00 for this notebook to have the motherboard replaced when all I sent it back for was a broken head phone piece.  I purchased an extended warranty at time of purchase also, guessing this is worthless also.","I don't have much experience with chromebooks in general but this thing feels just right. For browsing, youtube, email, google docs, shopping, or anything you might want to do on the internet, this device is very comfortable. Sure the screen could have been a bit bigger but that would have probably been more money. So far we've bough 3 of these. At $159.00 a piece these are an incredible bargain. They have a very utilitarian look. I think they were going for the \"calculator\" look, which in my opinion is a great concept for this device. The charge lasts hours and the keys are big and have a nice feel. The rubber grips at the bottom are a really great feature. I attached a wireless mouse which worked right away without having to do any of that \"detecting your hardware... installing driver...\" etc that you need to do with Windows. So far my kids have used theirs for about 5 months with no issues and I just got mine a few days ago and so far so good. I think ASUS did a great job and I hope they continue to build these affordable rugged devices that are good for kids and adults alike.","Technology and its prices are moving fast and I have to say this unit has made me a ChromeBook believer. I've enjoyed my time browsing\/surfing the internet and I was SURPRISED even for working remotely... I tested it for my work day that included webinar training and using my remote work tools like Citrix Receiver (common business tool).  Sound, picture, streaming quality was above expectations. *Setting up my home printer was a learning curve but there are a lot of quick instructions are out there but that's not a unit thing that's getting to know the ChromeBook operating system.  Outside of that its straight forward. Hint type chrome:\/\/devices in your browser (-; For the price I cannot believe the build and capability of the unit.  I know its marketed for the education\/kid use but it is great for traveling due to its rugged design features. If you plan to use it via your Google account and work through internet (cloud applications and remote tools) this unit is seriously a no brainer decision.  My 2 cents...","This is a nice little Chromebook - it works well when working online, is superfast and it seems well made even it it's not the prettiest Chromebook out there. The reason I only gave it three stars, is becaase it is impossible to do any work on it unless you are connected to the internet.  I do realize that Chromebooks are designed to be used online; however, some reviewers indicated that they were able to work on documents saved locally to the computer when WiFi was not available and then sync to the cloud later.  I did not find that to be the case, even for relatively short documents  (up to 5000 words) due to the extremely long  lag time while the document was saving locally on the computer.  I found that I could only type a few sentences before the Chromebook would freeze for up to four minutes while the work saved - and this happened frequently, probably every other paragraph. I am quite disappointed since I do need to work offline a lot and, clearly, cannot do so with this Chromebook - I do not know if all Chromebooks are this way or if it is just this brand but I would not have purchased had I known..that said, I do think it is a nice little Chromebook as long as you do not need to work offline.  If you do, I would steer clear....","This computer is great for my kids!  Like a lot of schools, my kids' school uses the Google platform, so a Chromebook is what they need.  These laptops are  tough and durable.  My kids have both said this model performs way better than their last Chromebooks, which of course got broken.  I bought them for the toughness and the speedy performance is a bonus!  The price is reasonable when compared to other Chromebooks with comparable specs.  Everybody is happy!  Dad is happy. 15 year old high school sophomore is happy.  11 year old 7th grader is happy.  How often can you say that? 08-30-17 EDIT  Okay, so I am in love with this Chromebook for my kids!  Even the ruggedized, tough nature of this unit eventually succumbed to my son and the LCD display got cracked and ruined (probably from being stuffed in his backpack between big thick textbooks).  The beauty of this Chromebook is that it is designed to easily replace the display.  I ordered a new display for like $40 from Amazon, and it took me 7 minutes to replace!  So, Azus made it tough....but they also made it easy to repair, even if it got broken.","I bought this Chromebook for my 10-year-old daughter. She has enjoyed it very much and uses it for school homework. She also uses it to explore appropriate YouTube channels and is becoming very good at using computer programs. One downside is that there is a key on the keyboard that is not functioning properly. She was afraid I would return the Chromebook so she didn't tell me about it until I asked her about it over dinner. Basically, one of the punctuation keys does not work and needs to be hit three or four times before working.  She has figured out a workaround to avoid using this key.I wish the keyboard worked normally so she wouldn't have to do that. It is still under warranty so I may return it for a working keyboard but not sure yet because my daughter would be upset with me if I take it away. Besides this issue, she is really enjoying the Chromebook.","I like the Chromebook, but am not happy that I have had it less than a week and the price dropped $20! My wife saw it and took it with her on a trip, so I have had it myself only one day. She told me I needed to buy another one! (At least the price has dropped!) That is a miracle as I have two Windows laptops she will not touch and four Kindles she refuses to use. Seems the Chromebook was the  answer all along. UPDATE: After 1 1\/2 years the computer is still working great and my wife still loved it for her trips. However, the power cord went out and I could not charge the battery. Be prepared to spend another $18-19 on a replacement power cord. Thankfully, I was able to order one from Amazon and got it in two days. Now the computer is back in use.","My daughter uses this for her online public school courses as well as her online college courses and she loves it. Just be aware that there is no caps lock, you can't right click and there's no dvd\/CD player. You can download Microsoft office but you have to do it online. My daughter uses google docs though and she's been fine.","This Chromebook offers excellent value for the price, if it does what you need.  The build quality is very solid, the screen image quality is quite good for its size, the keyboard is comfortable enough for touch typing, and the N3060 CPU is powerful enough to handle most net-centric activities -- i.e. checking\/read\/writing emails, streaming videos, light productivity work with the Google apps\/G-Suite.  If that's all you need to do when you're on the go, it's hard to beat the price on this machine!","Oh man, this thing is great!! I've been looking for a while for a small laptop that is FAST and has good internet connectivity, and this baby delivers.  It takes about three seconds to boot and the internet speed is BLAZING.  Great for browsing the web and watching videos, and it's actually turning into a good work device too.  I just connect to the office via Citrix and this machine operates so quickly that I almost forget I'm working remotely.  No need for Windows on my home device when I can connect to the Windows environment in the office so seamlessly. Also this laptop is very rugged and has good \"feel.\"  It almost reminds me of the fisher-price toys I used to use as a kid, and I mean that in an entirely complimentary way.  Good solid buttons and feels like it could survive some abuse. I also want to give some props to Amazon. I had ordered a Lenovo windows machine and was unhappy because it was so slow and laggy and failed to get good WiFi (which worked fine for my other devices).  I returned the Lenovo machine and Amazon gave me a refund right away (and I mean right away, like instant). So I picked up this machine the next day and it's exactly what I was looking for. Thanks Amazon!","I spent days researching laptops and Chromebooks trying to figure out what the best option would be for homeschooling my three elementary aged children. I finally settled on this Chromebook, and man I'm glad I did. I was skeptical after reading all the reviews but I'm skeptical about everything these days. So in some of the reviews I saw complaints about screen quality, a cap lock button not working etc. Well, it's a Chromebook so it does not have a cap lock button, so that's a non issue. The screen quality doesn't compare to my iMac, but I wasn't expecting it to, my iMac cost me $1,300 and this Chromebook cost me $216. The screen quality I think is amazing for the price. It's not bad at all. It's not like playing an Atari or the old Sega genesis we had as kids lol. All in all I bought 3 of these Chromebooks and I think they are a great buy! They are very speedy for my slow internet connection and everything functions flawlessly and did I mention they are really easy to set up and operate!? This is just what I needed for the kids. Now I can stay organized with all of my kids school work, no fighting over my expensive desktop and the kids have everything they need in a compact Chromebook. I couldn't be happier with my purchase! They are plenty rugged (mind you they are still a delicate electronic device, I don't care how rugged anyone claims an electronic device to be, my children are going to be taught to treat then very delicately!). But they are rugged enough where I feel if there was a minor accidental drop etc, they would be fine. I say go for it! We love ours!! I will be back to update in the event one of them dies or malfunctions and warranty is not honored or something like that. I'm hoping these will last a long time, in the end, if they last 2+ years they have paid for themselves in my eyes.","I'm in a Doctoral program, picked this up considering it's price, never had a chromebook before, never again. I downloaded from the Google app store, the MS Office apps, Word, XL, PPT and a few other things I tend to use. In a virtual class, we use Zoom.  I had chrome open, 3 tabs I think, and the Word and PPT app, and the zoom app with about 7 connections, only 1 using video.  Sound was static-y, slurring, breaking up, in and out.  Video was not so great, pausing, skipping, basically Verzion's issues at home.  I repeatedly got a pop up message, something to the effect of, \"Performance issues due to low resources\" (overtaxing the processor).  THAT'S NOT GOOD!! I'm probabaly returning the device.  If it cannot handle 3 tabs open in chrome, 2 apps, and zoom, it's a dud.  Very confused how this got such great reviews.  People must be using it for writing 1 or 2 sentences of unformatted text in notepad - otherwise, it's pretty useless.","At first I thought I would hate this laptop. I bought it because it was cheap, and I needed one for various task. I did my far share of research, and bought it hesitantly. ASUS is a great brand and this laptop in general does great for things web based. I use it as a beater laptop and it has held up against all the abuse I have thrown at it. As a student, its perfect. It does most everything I need it to, without failing. Its long battery life, and exceptional keyboard have landed it a place in my heart. Although I still would use a windows or mac for my other affairs, like running big programs and other strenuous task, this laptop is great for adults who travel, only need a laptop for email, banking, or Facebook, and children who need a decent laptop for school. I gave this five stars because of its rugged design, light build, battery life, and exceptional keyboard. The only downside I've found is not being able to run programs like itunes and the like, and the difficulty to get use to the chrome based operating system.","This Chromebook is pretty great! I'd recommend it for anyone who wants to get a pretty petite laptop for a reasonable price. Though, I gave it a four star rating because sometimes it will freeze and won't respond to your toach and just turn off for about 15 seconds.","The most frustration piece of technology I've ever encountered.  Lugged this all but useless \"brick\" (as another disgusted reviewer called the object) for a month-long trip in backroad India, thinking I could download a copy of a novel in progress and work on it offline.  And listen to my new Spotify account.  But-- no Spotify, and a paragraph into an edit, the thing would lock up, sending me cute error messages.  After maybe a hundred tries to set things right, all of my files were grayed out and inaccessible.  There are brilliant people behind designing the computers that now all but rule our lives, but there are idiots who foul up a wonderful technology by making daily use, by ordinary mortals, a mouse and keyboard-driven hell.  Sent it back to Amazon, for a full refund, with a bit of satisfaction, knowing the stubborn thing will be consigned to some sort of cyber scrap heap.","if you are over 70 and willing to retrain your brain the Asus is a fun & suitable LITTLE option from my [RIP] Toshiba laptop.  no NUMBERS pad traditionally to the right of keyboards. The numbers are only @ top of keyboard. No CAPS LOCK but ALT+SEARCH works. NO DELETE KEY. COPY AND PASTE is an exercise not for the fingered arthritic tho a simple 'relearnable' process. PRINT set up was easier than i made it out to be. Just go to YOUTUBE and watch any of the tutorials there. Waterproofing is not common in all chromebooks...a nice add on to have.  Approx 108\" charge cord is great perk. ASUS CHROMEBOOK is so much lighter than my laptop! *Add a case for $9.99. Its worth it. Warranty too if you can afford it being 1\/4th that of chromebook itself.**dont rely on C.S...its faster to work thru any issues on your own via the many videos and safe self help sites..... Welcome to 2018 !","Bought this computer to use as a portable service manual resource for a team of 3-4 mechanics. It is generally taken by a mechanic to a vehicle to look up procedures, torque specs, or circuit diagrams and so it ends up in weird places and gets lots of grease and dirt all over it (fortunately we have a silicone cover for our keyboard) and has dropped off of a lifted car onto concrete. When I need to clean it, I just spray a little brake parts cleaner on the cover and wipe it off. It's ridiculous. We could probably run over this thing and it'll still work. The only issue I've ever had with it is when it was sat on top of the ignition wires of a running engine (they're generally at around 5-10kV) to bring up a diagnosis procedure or something, the touchpad didn't like it and stopped responding for a week. After that, continued working great for a couple months before someone did it again. But another week later and it's like it never happened. I can't imagine any other laptop surviving such utter brutality and still be perfect after the 8-9 months we've had it.","I bought this 6 months ago and this week it just stopped charging. I noticed some others have had this issue as well. Very upsetting.","Honestly I almost didn't even bother typing this out but if it can help a person out then hey why not? Sigh... I bought this because I was tired of windows 10 I hate it so bad, and couldn't bother with buying an apple laptop $$. Let's just start with the bad, because why not? I bought this pint sized device less than 6 months ago and it's already acting up. The random black outs mid task are driving me up a wall (although it takes less than a minute or two to reboot itself) no one should have to deal with that. Also, sometimes it will freeze if I'm watching a video followed by the loading circle \"not responding\" icon, that's fun too. I'm not one of those Internet users with tons of tabs or apps open 24\/7 so I don't understand the crashes. There isn't a designated caps lock button, it is replaced with a search button instead... something that I personally do not care to ever use! On the bright side, it can be tweaked into being a caps lock button in the settings thankfully. (Random: there is no number keys on the right side either, just your designated numbers on the top row of the keyboard, it's compact so that's understandable...) If you're used to using a larger laptop, you will fall into the habit of hitting the screen lock\/power button instead of the backspace button.... Slow blink. You'll eventually get used to it though. It's a notebook, so dont assume that you can download anything (software etc) or use this bad boy for music storage and photo albums because you cant. Well you can, but you won't be able to open it obviously. It's not readable.  For an example, If you transferred a music album from your phone to this note book, you will not be able to open the file. It's not a real con, it's just a heads up. Crome books are strictly web based. No back light for the keyboard,  don't bother with the late night typing, you won't be able to see. The HDMI port is hit or miss. Sometimes it connects and recognizes my tv as a secondary display,  and other times its like \"meh... nah\" It's a matte plastic display, so its not the brightest, or sharpest visual wise. Well if that stuff doesn't steer you away then go for it. The battery life is pretty good, charges fast... it's portable with rubberized edges so it has a better shot at surviving a drop. Usb and 3mm headphone port all there. The speakers are good enough, and it updates regularly. I personally won't recommend this crome book though.","We had a key pop off under totally normal usage, and ASUS would not repair it under warranty.  They quoted us $130 to replace a KEY.  This is allegedly a ruggedized chromebook, yet you can't even type on it without keys popping off and they consider that unwarrantied damage by user.  Ridiculous.  I have been an ASUS customer for a long time, this is really making me rethink this.","I really enjoy this little handy Chromebook! I bought this one USED, since all of my electronics are either refurbished, or lightly used because I find most electronics are not worth NEW price. I use a main PC as my work station, but I bought this for light school use for PAPERS, BROWSING, and listening to MUSIC and so far it works GREAT! Opened right up, plug and play, perfect for casual use for STUDENTS, MOM\/POP, or even teenagers!","We use this chromebook for our kids for school. We bought this one because it's made for that purpose.  This morning I took it off the charger and realized it hadn't charged at all. I tried different outlets  and couldn't get it to charge no matter where I plugged it in. So clearly there is a problem with the chromebook or the charger. I called ASUS warranty support. The customer support person had me try a few different things to get it working and nothing seemed to help. No matter what we did the chromebook wouldn't charge and wouldn't turn on. So, she suggested that I go and buy a new charger and see if that fixes it.  She had no suggestion of where to go to find one or how I should make sure I got the right one, but just that I buy a charger and try it.  Really not helpful. So I asked what else we could do.  She suggested that I send it in.  Fine.  So now we are sending the notebook in, It will take 7-10 business days - so 2 or three weeks considering the upcoming holidays plus shipping time.  So we will now be out of use of this notebook which we really need for a month. She did offer me expedited return shipping at $30 but that's not really helpful. She also suggested I back up all my data before I ship it to them. Of course I can't power the thing on. So I asked her how I should go about doing that.  She suggested I take it to a local repair person to back up the data and that this person would be able to power it on and pull the data off.  No suggestions of where to go for that but apparently there is someone out there near me who can do this.  I guess. All in all she was not helpful and I'm very disappointed with their warranty support.  With other companies I've dealt with in the past returns and warranty repairs have been easy and fast.  ASUS doesn't seem to want my business in the future.","It's small, but I love the fact that it's sturdy, unlike a mac air. It's water proofed, and drop proofed to some degree. Accidentally dropped a glass of water on the mac air keyboard, and it's gone, so expensive!!. The keys on this Asus feel nice, although the lettering on them is a blue on black so not as easy to see. It had an HDMI, that's a big plus, so I can plug it into my tv screen. So incredible you can buy something with all this power, and chrome for $199!  It has a nice feel to the keys. The screen is pretty small, I'm wondering if a 13 inch would be good. But, I love the idea of no built in obsolesence as in the macs, in about 4 years, you have to get a new one as it will no longer take the security upgrades. that's a lot of money for me at their price point. Downside to some chrome computers is you have to have a printer that is google cloud enabled. (Mine is an older brother printer, so I can't print with the Acer I have.) I think this Asus will accept the printer, but haven't tried yet.  Long battery life. I installed https everywhere, as instructed for additional security. Chrome is supposed to be the very best right now at security when traveling the world wide web.","I bought this for my 7 year old son, as I was looking for a sturdier computer he could use for school work. He was using an old laptop of mine earlier, but after only a few months, he accidentally dropped the laptop and it broke. So far, this sturdy little Chromebook has met all his needs: access to his documents and presentations for school, his school e-mail and the occasional web browsing. I like the substantial keyboard, which makes it harder for my son to make mistakes when typing; the rugged design is also a plus. The battery life right now is excellent and I hope we never get to test this Chromebook's water resistant keyboard. All this for under USD 200 (when I bought it here at Amazon, but I could see that the price has now increased). This was a really good buy. [EDITED]: We bought this Chromebook for our son because we liked the Supervised Users feature - only to have Google pull out support for it this January 2018. The offered Family Link alternative is no good to us - it only works in 5 countries (not where we live in), and also is not a like-for-like alternative. I've changed my review from a highly recommended 5 stars to a stay-away-from-it 1-star.","It is much smaller than I expected, about the size of a Mac book and the screen it about the size of a tablet screen- which put me off at first but it is super light and stores easily. It is also very minimal but I like that too. It is put together very well and there are no flimsy plastic vents that will easily break or anything like that. So far it seems like it is built to last without being super bulky and ugly. It also does not have a disc drive, if that is something you are looking for and it is made by google chrome so it it doesn't opperate off of windows or like a Mac but with a simple google chrome system which is really easy to use and pretty cool. I will basically use it to go online and to watch Netflix so I don't need it to do a bunch and it will serve that purpose perfectly. If you are looking for something minimalistic (but not completely unattractive), easy to use, and durable that doesn't take up a lot of space this is a great little laptop. I could see it being perfect for older people that aren't tech savvy or young students- or for someone like me that wants something affordable, simple and that wont break with everyday use.","after 6 months since purchase the Chromebook's screen blew a fuse.  There is no visible damage from the outside, even though this device is \"Suppose\" to handle falls or liquids.","I've got two of these that my kids have taken to school for the last year and a half. They're rock solid and if you buy a gsuite account from Google to manage these, you get excellent parental controls. Outside of that, the parental controls are somewhat lacking without buying Chrome Extensions.. The kids are able to do absolutely everything they need to with the exception of use Microsoft products. If you've got a subscription of Microsoft Office 365, you can use the online versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint to get any relevant school work done. The only failure we've had is the audio jack on one doesn't work anymore, but that's because it's on the side and when my son has it in his lap, a lot of the laptops weight gets transferred right into that jack. Having a 90 degree adapter would remove most of that strain though.","I bought this because I couldn't stand the \"touchy\" touchpad of the Samsung chromebook I received as a gift.  This thing is awesome!  And I just LOVE the way Asus packs their laptops (I bought a bigger laptop previously and this one is for portability plus an option to avoid Windows).  I was not prepared for the sturdy build which I LOVE as I do have \"butter fingers\" when it comes to electronics.  And it is NOT heavy at all.  It's perfect size and rugged, with a rubber feel to all the edges.  The key strokes are perfect for my taste and the blue (not illuminated) letters and digits are much preferred to the stark white of the Samsung).  So many ports!  Battery just hangs on for hours!  Buy this baby!","I use this laptop for writing. I can throw it in my bag with my notebooks and go. Battery life has never let me down. I\u2019ve yet to ever need to take the charger with me for a day trip. I accidentally dropped it once and then kicked it, sending it flying across the floor. It didn\u2019t even stutter and continued to perform perfectly afterward. The ONLY thing keeping this from being the ideal machine is a backlit keyboard. The keys are labeled in a bright blue that stands out, but I do sometimes have to lean in when writing in very low light conditions; outside at night when there isn\u2019t a ton of ambient light, for example. I\u2019d definitely be willing to pay extra for this feature; it would make it the perfect machine for me. That being said, this book is a steal at the price. Highly recommended!","It was great and I kinda liked it until I went to power it up after two days use (less then 12 hours use). Wouldn\u2019t even turn on when I pressed power button, no damage and nothing downloaded to make it act up, literally sat on my computer desk closed and powered off every time until I wanted to use it again, had to return it just waiting for refund. DEFINITELY WILL NOT RECOMMEND ONE BIT!","Worked for just 2 months and then if battery ran down, would not start, giving message to reload Chrome operating system. Now unit will run only when plugged into AC. Will not run on battery power. Attempted to contact ASUS Tech support via their email support address.  No response. Unlikely to consider buying another ASUS prroduct. Update: I discovered that since the unit was \"refurbished\" it was classified and without warranty when finally trying to get repaired under warranty.","I like this - I play some talk video to put me to sleep and it frequently will fall off the bed onto carpet. No harm so far. (I lost an earlier, different Chromebook to dropping on cement, twice, from a greater height. This hasn't been tested that way, but I'm happy to know this has a little bit of cushion.) One thing I've very \/unhappy\/ about, is the down-arrow key - I've had this for 18 months, now, (actually mine is an earlier C202S, not this C202SA) and probably around the 1 year mark the down-arrow key started popping off. You could put it right back on, and for a while it set just fine, it didn't seem to wear or become generally looser, but it finally has. I've found a replacement key, but 1 year or less is too early to start falling apart. Also, the right side of the touch pad can't handle 'right clicks' (two fingers) anymore, but that's less irritating. I love the 4GB of memory - I have about 60 tabs open just fine, and my former 2GB machine would have crashed long before this. Probably Chrome OS has improved, too, but I wouldn't want to test it by giving up the extra 2GB (to make 4GB).","what a garbage computer- it's a  glorified tablet withe a  built in keyboard for pint-sized hands- (5'5 w\/ normal hands) or someone who has no clue how to actually type\/use a keyboard- 'hunt & peck method'- has functionality of a kindle fire but way more $$$.  lack of  delete button is beyond annoying-  move around & use your backspace- seriously? you need to do a workaround on a 'keyboard'? absolute garbage-  my brother thought this would be a good choice for my current needs- even he struggled with it and felt terrible that he'd recommended this and not an  iPAD which is what I should have gotten- hind sight is 20\/20 and now this single mom has $200.00 of garbage that she has deal with because there is zero budget for anything that would actually work!!!","I've had this for a couple of months now trying to get used to this and I'm just not impressed. If I could return it I would. There is no caps lock or delete button on the keyboard which I find very odd. The scroll bar on the side of the screen is always floating and sometimes just disappears making it a challenge to scroll. I've looked for a way to make it appear all the time but couldn't find one. This is specially frustrating on pages like FB when you're in a message or checking emails. I bought this thinking it would be a good option for my small non profit to help me keep up with various things like FB posts, messages, emails, and managing documents but it's more of a hassle then anything.","The picture is pretty good and it is lightweight, but it crashes and overheats easy. Just opening my e-mail caused it to crash just ten minutes before writing this, but that may have been because of incorrect shut down right before posting this. It also does an automatic turn on and that may be affecting it too. I tend to use this for e-mails, Youtube, and online searching. Just be gentle with it and it works super well. Truthfully, I plan on gifting it to my mother so she can use it for farmville and buying a better one. Update, I used it right after work and if you put a lock on it for even in sleep mode. It will not crash even with heavy usage. The battery life is terrible though. Youtube cutes it from 12+ hours of use to a little over 10. Also, keep it up off of anything that can make it overheat. you HAVE to use an e-mail account to use it though. Kinda frustrating.","Likes: lightweight and robust so I can take it to my classes. Feels comfortable in my lapcwhen I'm watching videos. I like that it has dedicated buttons to adjust screen brightness and sound. Dislike: does not have a right-click option on the keypad (if I attempt to right click something it treats it like a regular left click). There's probably a workaround (like using ctrl-click to open a new webpage). I also don't like how limited the Google Play store is. I'm also limited on which programs I can use with Google Chrome (most are only Windows or IOS compatible). Conclusion: I'd say this is a good budget computer for kids and students. Anybody wanting to use this for something more complex, such as gaming, Photoshop, etc, this would not be the right computer for you.","I bought this chromebook after I read the top helpful review here. So far I really enjoy this laptop and use it every day. I  rarely used my old  hp laptop because it was heavy and ran slow until I decided to factory reset it but saw a \"refresh laptop\" option instead and installed another 4gb ram (8gb ram total). I was skeptical about this chromebook because it's only 4gb ram and hardly has memory but everything gets saved to your Google drive. I did a little bit of research when I was laptop shopping and read that chromebooks don't need a lot of ram to run faster because they have an  SSD instead of the old HHD. So I narrowed my search down to a Windows PC with 8gb ram and an SSD or a chromebook! A good windows PC with those specs would've cost me $500+. I started my laptop search without knowing ANYTHING about computer specs and what they meant but you can go on YouTube or Google and find out what's best for you. This laptop definitely isn't for everyone but I've been able to use it for all my needs. It isn't like a Mac or Windows pc where you can download programs and add them to your desktop but you can download apps from the Google play store like you would on a phone or tablet. I would definitely recommend this chromebook for people who just want to browse the internet, watch videos, download apps in the play store, and people who are scared of getting viruses. I read that it's much harder to get a virus on a chromebook than on a Windows PC. This is perfect for kids or people who are likely to catch viruses. I like that it's rugged, doesn't weigh much, is water resistant and stays powered on for hours without a charger. The only thing I can complain about is that not all my HDMI cables work on this. I have 3 HDMI cables and only one works on it. The others work on everything else (ps4, other laptops, etc)","I was super excited to receive this item. It was everything I was hoping for and would have been thrilled with it, except after 48 hours for no reason it shut off and I could not reboot. Sent it back for replacement and received another that worked for a week then the same thing. Sent it back and asked for a refund. It doesn\u2019t matter how cool it is if it doesn\u2019t work.","I purchased this to use as a tertiary machine, and it has exceeded expectations considering the price. Though Chrome OS can be limiting as far as offline applications are concerned, the developer mode allows the user to run a Linux desktop, effectively side-stepping this concern. I use the laptop occasionally, and the charge has been lasting for about a week.","I bought this chromebook for bringing to school with me and doing homework on the go.  It started right up the first time I turned it on and was very direct and user friendly.  I don't require a lot of storage space since all of my work is saved in the school's network and I don't have a whole bunch of media saved on the computer, and so far haven't run into any issues.  Screen visibility, key action, mouse-pad response is good and so is the sound quality for playing videos.  Also, I like that it is light-weight and has a sturdy design for being on the go.  The one thing that I would change is the color of the letters on the keys, as they are hard to see in lower light.  What helps with this though is that the 'h' and 'j' home keys have little raised bars that you can feel for.  All in all, a great little computer for the price.","Well I bought my first chromebook 3 years ago, and another this year. The first one now has a an irratic wi-fi board ( yes, the asus c202 has a small m.2 wifi card that can be replaced ) I went ahead and bought an external usb 3.0 wifi adapter and the internal replacement intel 7265 ( 8265) I find interesting nothing on help about this problem other than 'reset\/replace your router', clear case of the hardware just dying, early on I found if I un-mounted the sd-card, and usb-thumb drive that would take some load off the current on the usb bus, but even that fails to work, so it means frequent hard reboots to get the wi-fi controller back, sometimes its good for days, sometimes hours. Totally random failure Rock solid little guy, of course google-chrome is terrible, but I always ran crouton(linux), but now that fails post nov-2018, so I'm using the new google supported 'linux' its ok, but very limited in memory\/storage, as the google virtual box, doesn't let you use the external devices, which means your linux is limited to a total of about 8gb for all sys&apps, which ain't much if your running R&PYTHON and doing light development. Great little laptop, much better than ACER ( in terms of reliability ), but now I'm seeing that the infant mortality ain't forever, that 2+ years these little guys start failing. In terms of pure chrome, I think these are great for newbies who just want to shop & do social networking on a laptop, also great support for cameras and such built-in, of course its all SPY-WARE by default, so if your running in Google Mode, you must turn off all the default stuff that listens, watches, records everything you do, including phone, sms, email, sound, video, ... body-motion ( if your on a laptop) moderns 9-axis gravity chips can certainly monitor respiration, so in theory could know your excitability :) Great price, around $100  for a great little Laptop, certainly ONLY huge problem is lack of support for BIG devices, I was running a short 128GB USB thumb drive, but it literally burned up when used for crouton on these little laptops, not enough cooling, the SD-CARDS seem to run much more cool. But now that crouton doesn't work well with the newer version of chrome, your stuck with the new google version of linux, but for the virtual box doesn't support anything outside of a tiny virtual space allocated out of the 16gb total memory, remember if you move up to say 64\/128gb chromebooks your talking almost $1,000, so its clear that this C202 is an entry, and the PAIN threshold is to get you to move to APPLE PRICING. I quit using apple laptops, because they quit letting you upgrade your old laptops, I'm certain in time google will do the same with this device and say \"Too old to upgrade old chrome-book, time to buy new\", ... just like Apple.","I bought this particular Chromebook because I dropped the last one and broke it, and this one is supposed to be more durable and also water resistant. I have not tested out the water resistance yet, but it seems less likely to break when I inevitably drop it, mostly because it is very plastic-y.  Like another reviewer mentioned, it almost seems like a toy computer. It is about twice the thickness of my previous computer and there is a ridge on the base that I guess is supposed to help you grip it? I haven't found that particularly useful, but it does put the keyboard at a slight angle, which I like. Speaking of the keyboard, the keys are raised and the labels are bright blue (another reason it looks like a toy), which makes it easier to type on than most laptops I've used, but there is a noticeable clicking sound when typing. The trackpad also makes a clicking sound, and doesn't seem as sensitive as my other computer, two-finger (right) clicking is particularly difficult. My main complaint is the screen brightness, or lack thereof. It looks like an old desktop monitor, kind of dull and almost pixelated. It does boot up fast, and the battery life is amazing, right now I've been using it for over an hour with 10 tabs open, and the battery is still at 99%. This would be a good first laptop for a child, but as a (semi) professional adult, I feel a little silly using it in public.","In less than a year, this chromebook's motherboard failed  because of physical damage(we did not open it) and the repair thru ASUS would cost me $215 to repair my \"rugged\" chromebook! It was still under warranty from the manufacturer. The video showing the person dropping it should give a disclaimer that it might not be covered under the warranty.","Design makes sense with durable construction and 180 degree opening.  Chromebooks downcoming is the challenges related to saving items onto it.  Documents, photos, etc. have to be saved in the \"Downloaded\" file or a subfile of Downloaded has to be created. There is no way to save items to what is commonly known as the Desktop.  From a security perspective, if you don't want documents, files, pictures, etc. in the cloud and exposed to getting hacked, then ANY Chrombook, including this one is not for you.  Well made and has an exceptionally clear screen, yet for the needed functionality that it did not have, it was returned.  Lastly, our understanding was the the keyboard was backlit.  It is not, so working in limited light is challenging to see the keyboard.","We are a large family with all boys.  Therefore, quality is EXTREMELY important to us.  This Ruggedized Chromebook gets high marks from us! I spent a lot of time researching and comparing the various Chromebooks available and selected this one.  I knew that I wanted an Asus.  Then I compared the various Asus models.  This \"Ruggedized\" version was about $20 more than another one I was considering.  Ultimately I chose this one and am so glad that we did.  We have all boys.  Items get a lot of wear and tear.  The keyboard is waterproof, although as of yet we haven't needed to test that.  I like that the bottom has a bit of grip to it, so the device doesn't slide around easily.  We have Netflix on the bar at the bottom and our 3-year-old has easily figured out how to access his favorite show all by himself.  We bought this item to reduce wear and tear on my personal laptop.  The Chromebook is used for Netflix (we use the HDMI port and connect to our TV), internet browsing, etc.  We love this purchase so much that we have it in our cart and plan on purchasing another one.","Bought unit new August 16, 2018. Died today November 8, 2019. Factory warranty: 12 months. Never abused. Placed on shelf in shop to stream music and it never moved. Gotta hand it to them, when they are selling an inferior product they have a pretty good idea when it will fail. I suspect battery failure. Will not charge or power up. What a POS. Save your money and buy something else. Anyone have an idea what battery is in this thing and can it be replaced? Update: 11-15-18 Found this on Amazon  Battpit\u2122 Laptop\/Notebook Battery Replacement for Asus Chromebook C202SA-YS02 (5000mAh \/ 38Wh) and opened up the Chromebook and replaced the battery. It booted right up and took off as I had hoped. There are 10 small Phillips screws on the bottom 8 you can see and 2 behind a thin plastic film. About that many hold the battery in. The whole keyboard pops off the base and there are two small ribbon cables attaching it. These cables are released by flipping up little \"doors\" on the receptacles and then the cable lifts out. There is a flat metal heat sink that goes over the battery held on by 4 screws. A 3rd ribbon cable crosses over the battery and plugs in to a circuit board using the same flip door receptacle as the other two. The battery has its own small plug that plugs into the circuit board. The new battery is a direct replacement and the only tools needed are a tiny Phillips and a small flat to pop the keyboard off the base. Pretty simple to do if you are so inclined.","Exact same issues with so many other 1 star re views for this company and this product. Repaired 3 times in the 1st 4 months of owning it. Horrible product. Sent in for repairs only to get it back with other items broken?  Laptop was not in my possession and my daughter was unable to use for school for a total of 30 days in the 1st 4 months?  Stay far away from this company and this product if you value your time, money and sanity. There is no concern for quality control or customer satisfaction.  Internal components are cheap and supervisors will not refund your money no matter how many times they repair their product under warranty.  YOU WILL BE BUYING A REPLACEMENT IN AFTER MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS AT WARRANTY REPAIRS WHEN PRODUCT FAILS 4 TIMES IN 1st 4 MONTHS.  SAVE THE TROUBLE AND GO WITH A COMPETITOR. Supervisors are mindless drones that will forget to send a record of your complaint and fail to call you back for 4 weeks at a time.  That's my rant after they wasted 15 hours of my time on the phone and tried to get me to pay the equivalent of a 2nd new Chromebook.  Diagnostics alone will run you $60 and then they will gouge you for hundred in repairs for something that freezes or fails to boot up the first month you take it out of the box.  Who would fall for that kind of double dipping???  Hope you have the sense to heed the warning on this page and find a suitable product for your family.","In high school, my school let me have this Chromebook for the school year. It worked great and I never had issues with it. When I graduated from high school, I bought a Windows 10 laptop. I also had a Windows Vista desktop at home. I went to college for the first year with a Windows laptop. After my first year I wanted to try a Chromebook again so I bought the same one that my high school had let me use and I was impressed. I have found that my Chromebook is more reliable than my Windows laptop because my Chromebook is always working fully and it has no issues so far. Chromebooks are much more simple and have a lot less settings than a Windows computer which makes it harder to accidentally mess it up. Windows computers can take over an hour to reinstall Windows while it takes no more than five minutes to reset a Chromebook. While this Chromebook now has the Google Play Store, the only downside is, that it may not support all the software you need. That is not really an issue for me because my Chrome fulfills all my software needs.","This is an excellent piece of equipment with no touch screen.  My only disappointment is that it was listed when I searched for touch screens and I did not catch that it did not have that feature.  However, it is solid, fast, excellent clarity on screen, glitch-free, no hassles just works, and my wife likes it so we kept it.  If you want a Chromebook laptop, this is an excellent choice.","Bought for the use on a deployment, intended for just basic web browsing, movie watching and communicating back home. I bought this so I could leave behind my more expensive and heavier macbook pro. Surprisingly, this chromebook may be replacing that as my daily use. Overall I think the chromebook setup is pretty intuitive, I use a lot of the google products so having gmail, google drive etc all in one place is nice. I don't think doing anything like photoshop or heavy gaming on this chromebook would work, however for everyday basics its well worth the small price. One USB port on either side along with an HDMI port and SD card reader is nice. My only small gripe is the speakers could be WAY better, at full volume everything sounds muted and muffled, could be because of the placement of the speakers on the sides of the chromebook. Battery holds a long charge, regularly get 8-10 hours off a full battery. For what you pay for this, I think its a great notebook.","The jury is still out for the most part.  I had this less than a month and the touch pad stopped functioning.  Amazon is great about returns on defective stuff so they sent another.  However, I'm not sure if it was a lemon or the product is just low quality.  I will see after the next one.  Otherwise, it would be better if the keyboard was illuminated or at least glow in the dark.  I like the rugged features.  This my first experience with Chromebooks and I like the fact that they are easy to use.  I dislike the lack of hardware control (I could not diagnose the touch pad problem for lack of utility software).  The units are like dumb-terminals that are disposable.  I also dislike the lack of sufficient parental controls but that is an Amazon issue, not Asus.  Parental controls need the ability to give the child access to a limited list of applications and an app shopping experience that is based on parental ratings so nothing that is inappropriate is available in the shopping experience.  As it is, the parental controls completely locks the kid (supervised user) out of the majority of functionality - even email.  The parental controls should also offer the ability to remotely lock out and shut down the computer as well as operation times it is allowed to function.","This is the handiest little thing, and the battery charge lasts just about forever.","We bought this for our now second grader at the start of the year last year. We dont send devices to school with kindergarteners as a rule in our house, but I think it could stand up to my actual irresponsible kinder child if I needed to. My second grader brought this to school every day last year and is using it again this year. Being a typical child he has left it out at home where is 18m old sister has had some light use with it. He keeps it in a sleeve.. most of the time... to and from school. Its easy to use, rugged as instructed, etc. My list of cons: -> We have replaced the keyboards twice. Now if this was my kinder using this, I'd say my kid ripped them off. But this is my responsible child, I dont think they were ripped off. Replacmeent was easy enough.. a monkey could probably do it. -> the cover to the hinges has broken off and wont stay. Not sure if this affects the rugged proclamation, but there you go. -> no decent, and by decent we are talking wont compromize function, monitoring software or ability to restrict use. Must be done manually, which is ok.. but when your child begins getting to that curious age its becoming more important. -> increasing apps that my sons school uses that cannot be used on the computer. Class Dojo for one, but some apps like prodigy he can. Overall: I'll probably buy one for my other son next year, however if I find something better I would switch. I love asus products but the keyboard thing is especially depressing since they pop of so easy (within a week of my husband swapping them out)","It is great for what I wanted.  Fast 5 minutes out of the box.  I miss a back lit keyboard and number pad, but that is not what I bought it for.  It is easy to transport and appears rugged.  The 180 degree opening is nice.  I gave it 5 stars because for $200 it does it's job!  I can carry it in a pack or bookbag, it is light and thje screen actually works in the sun!  Thank you!  I received this in  3 days on a Sunday...","I purchased this Chromebook in December 2017. It's now just about December 2019 and I'm writing this review on the Chromebook. It has survived countless falls on my hardwood floor (sometimes with the screen open), liquid spills, air travel in checked luggage, crumbs etc. It's still running strong. I recently lost the plastic piece that covers the front of the hinge to a particularly hard fall. This is just a cosmetic issue. Similarly, I've lost the down arrow key cover. The actual key still works without the cover. I will probably need glue it back on so it looks nice again. Everything else is still present, the Chromebook is in excellent working order and continues to run fast with regular updates. The battery lasts for days on a single charge, I haven't had any issues with shortening battery life at all. The one deficiency is that the screen quality isn't amazing but it's absolutely fine for most web browsing needs, and it doesn't have any dead pixels so far. I lost my previous Chromebook to a foster dog urine deluge which is why I decided to go with this ruggedized option this time around. Thus far it has outlasted both of my other past Chromebooks. Considering how much I paid for it and how often I use it, it's an awesome deal. If you (or your pets) are hard on devices, this is an excellent option.","This is a great device for writing, it has a very very nice keyboard, decent screen (not mega HD but I don't mind), the battery is long lasting (almost 9 hours for me while watching videos), you can create documents offline which is very useful too and it came with a 12 month accident protection warranty for what I'm really grateful because I'm very clumsy. I'm in love with the keys on this laptop, I use it mostly for work and since I travel a lot it's perfect because it weights almost nothing and is very sturdy. The only bad thing is that when I write in Spanish it's a little annoying that I don't have the ''\u00f1'' key,  I had to choose US international (PC) keyboard to make it work properly and every time I need to write something like ni\u00f1o, se\u00f1uelo, a\u00f1adidura, etc. I have to press (shift) + (~) + (n). With time I got used to it and now I can flow when I type these words, but at first it can be annoying like I said. If you work online a lot (mail, drive, google, youtube, etc) this is perfect.","This thing is the little tank that could. 10 hour battery life. Quick startup\/restart time. Not easily compromised by water. Easy panel removal for parts replacements. Large keys with easy give. Simple Shortcuts: Even though it doesn't have buttons designated for CAPS or Function Keys, I can change purpose of unused to suit my needs. Works with most Android apps. Downside: Runs entirely on apps and extensions (which is great because there's little chance for viruses), but occasionally my screen will freeze up, fade to black, and then resume what I was doing. The blackouts my be a side effect of using certain extensions.","THIS CHROMEBOOK SUPPORTS ANDROID APPS !!! I could not be happier. After I did the latest update, Google Play allowed me to download any android app right onto the chromebook. You can install everything from games to uber on it. LOVE IT!","I ordered this nearly a month ago but I'm only just now writing this review. First off, I specifically ordered a Google Chrome Book because I was, frankly, tired of anything Windows and I wanted to try something different. This notebook did not disappoint. It is, first and foremost, meant for the mobile user. It boots up in less than a minute, and shuts down even faster. Being from Google, it will use your Google username and password, so if you don't have a Google account set up at the time you order, I would suggest you set one up. Software runs very fast, files load just as fast, and saving happens in the blink of an eye. If you have an Android cell phone, you are able to update and\/or download software from the Google Play Store, just like through your phone. For a small computer, it is surprisingly powerful and fast. I am very impressed with it. Sorry, Microsoft. You've been replaced.","The little laptop that can and does. There are a lot of complaints that Chromebooks are useless without an internet connection - it's total malarky. By changing a few settings so that my documents are all saved offline (google \"chromebook offline\" or something similar) and with the addition of an SD card this little laptop has become the most functionally portable laptop I've ever owned. I take it to school via public transit and to work where, for various reasons, it's not always safe from drops and spills. Because of the ruggedized design, SSD, and low cost I have no fear. It's small enough and light enough that I almost always have it with me, just in case I need it. For browsing the internet and researching and writing papers for school it's perfect\u2014the suite of Google Drive applications allow me to do everything I need to for school without shelling out any money for software. I've been using it daily for almost two years and the battery life has held up admirably\u2014I can still get over 10 hours of constant use (generally a mix of web browsing, Netflix\/Hulu, typing, and streaming music via Bluetooth) between charges. Once I went out of town with it turned on and when I came back almost two weeks later the battery was still at 88%. I've recommended this laptop to just about everyone in the market for one (and quite a few people who aren't in the market). My only disclaimer is that if you're the kind of person who has a lot of old tv shows and movies torrented, it may not play all of them, though the VLC app is getting better.","It's great for what it is. Just know it really only gets you on the internet. You can't install programs and it's honestly sort of slow. But not horrible for the money. It's lightweight and silent. It doesn't overheat, and if you have an android it synchs so everything is connected. You don't even have to log in, if your phone is near it just starts where you left off.","The laptop itself is amazing. It runs well and the ruggedized texture and look is definitely worth paying a little extra for. It feels great to hold and use. The only thing I would say holds the laptop back is the chromeOS. If this came with no OS or something like Linux Mint or Ubuntu it would be absolutely perfect. But the chromeOS makes doing a lot of things a hassle. Its possible to replace the OS but its a really big pain and probably not something the majority of users would be able to do comfortably. The only good thing about the chromeOS that I liked was how quickly it turns back on. But thats only because the laptop never really fully turns off. It just goes into a sort of sleep\/standby mode. With that said I'd hate to give this laptop anything less than a 5\/5 because the laptop itself is really high quality and even though the chromeOS isn't the best it still is doing the job I needed it for. Pros Light and portable. Quick to turn on. (Because it never fully turns off) Great for just browsing the internet or watching\/streaming video. Has a great look and feel to it. Good build quality. Fairly easy to take apart. The mouse takes a little getting used to but once you do get used to it its a very good mouse. Cons Pretty much all of the cons are to do with the chromeOS Poor compatibility with software. (You are limited mostly to google playstore apps unless you want to really work hard to install things.) Computer never fully turns off. (Both a pro and a con) Have to take the computer apart and void the warranty just to get full control of the device. Very small amount of storage space. (I ended up buying a small low profile flashdrive and use that for storage) If you are just going to use this as a laptop to browse the internet on or maybe do some banking on its the perfect laptop. If you had other plans I'd highly recommend getting a laptop that has windows installed even if you want to later install a linux OS its far easier to do that from windows than it would be from chromeOS.","ASUS build is solid, water resistant, claims 10 hr battery (more like 9 plus so far) and handles Android apps now. Sound is just ok, on board memory is 2nd gen capacity (next series is getting seriously larger) but using the SD slot for additional storage. Attached to Deloren InReach gps\/sat txt and using it with additional usb battery that has 19vdc  capacity. works ok and will handle libre office or apache office so I don't worry about being offline. tethered to my cell phone ok as well and home wifi works ok too. turning out to be a better replacement to my laptop and my tablet. Next is to see if VLC android will work.","First off, this is not a touchscreen even though that was one of my feature options for this review and I bought it after deliberating over other models that came up on my specific search for \"chromebook touchscreen\" It came up first - Amazon needs to check their algorithms on that. Even though this computer isn't touchscreen I wanted to love it. I love the look and feel. The rubber edges make it texture case make it more exciting than other lame ugly chromebooks. The keyboar is great even if the keys are a bit raised. I type fast and it feels good to type on here. The screen is not bright, very friendly for reading or being on at night. But BOY is it slow. I keep closing tabs to hope to speed it up but even with just a couple of tabs open it takes forever to load (I have fiber) - when I type I have to wait for what I typed to show up...and the real blow is that it can't even seem to stream Netflix. There is no question, I'm sending this back and probably will get something with better processing speed. This is quite useless when I'm typing and waiting 20 seconds for what I just typed to appear on the screen.","Bought this for my 5th grader for BYOD (bring your own device) for school.  Very easy for her to set up, battery lasts a good 10 hours, and she can use Google docs.  Great size and light weight.  Very study (she has dropped it twice without breakage).","Bought this for my kids since they always get food on other laptops and I thought this would be a cheap, capable machine for schoolwork or watching Netflix. In that sense it completely delivers. It over-delivers on rugged side, to a ridiculous degree that more than justifies picking this chromebook up. My son brought this outside to read in the late afternoon, but forgot to bring it back inside. Then it started to rain. After raining at a decent clip FOR OVER 12 HOURS we realized it was still outside. Brought it back in, figured it was toast. But no, still ran like a champ! Ridiculous, will definitely buy the latest version of this when we need another at home laptop.","When I first got this computer I loved it it was fast it was good quality however, after only two months the computer no longer works. The chrome screen comes on but it does not load. Complete waste of money. This was the second computer that I got from them the first one came with a broken key which I returned and they sent me a new one and this one worked for just 2 months.","This could have been a good laptop. But you really do get what you pay for with this one. The battery life is actually pretty good. Have had for around 10 months and its been good until the 6-month mark. It started to glitch out a ton, the wifi kept disconnecting, any Bluetooth device either won't connect or will connect, but will crack up, music I am listening to will just randomly pause for no reason, pages take a super long time to load and then say that the website is \"Blocked\" even though there are no restrictions on it, and on top of that is runs ChromeOS, which you pretty much can't do anything on but browse the internet. The speakers were surprisingly good, but sometimes sound just won't play, with or without headphones plugged in. Sometimes the laptop won't even turn on. The laptop has not been damaged or dropped at all and has been used almost every single day for about 3-5 hours for homework and casual entertainment, and it is still really slow. I know its a cheap laptop, and you really get what you pay for.","The battery life on this thing is amazing, truly. That said, it's missing a lot of keys that a more standard keyboard has. While initially this doesn't seem like a big deal, it actually annoys me more and more every day. If you're a proficient typist operating off of muscle memory, it completely throws you off. Be prepared to type = instead of backspace over and over again!","When it works, it's a nice device; very light, adequately fast, comfortable to use. Easy for my daughter to carry to and from school. I suppose if you got a \"good one\", it would be a 5-star device. Alas, one day it just died -- wouldn't boot or show any sign of life. Did the return\/repair process. Got the machine back a couple of weeks later, and it worked fine, for a couple of weeks. Now it's dead again. Sending the device back for repair again is annoying, to say the least. File under \"you get what you pay for\"."],"29":["As I write this, the Acer Chromebook 14 is sitting with 13 reviews, all of which are 5 stars... and I do feel a little bit bad here breaking up the perfect game, but after using this Chromebook for a few days, I feel I have an obligation to point out both its strengths and its drawbacks. Even writing that, I can't say I'm completely surprised by all of the 5 star reviews, as there are a lot of things that this Chromebook gets right. There are five key things worth highlighting here. First: the screen. Many of Acer's Chromebooks have, historically, been hampered by their poor displays. Thankfully, this time, Acer has gotten that part right. The Chromebook 14 has a 1080p IPS display with fantastic viewing angles and excellent brightness. I keep it at about 60-70% and it looks fantastic. It feels wonderful to finally say that about an Acer display. Second: the build materials. Chromebooks have generally been budget-friendly devices, but recently we've started to see some that are either mid-range and high quality (like the Dell 13) or are upper-low end budget devices that still use more premium build materials, like the Asus C100P \"Flip\" and now, the Acer Chromebook 14. Note that I said build materials, and not build quality. Third: 4GB RAM, 32GB local storage. A more recent trend among Chrome OS devices is the inclusion of 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, instead of the 2GB\/16GB to which we've become accustomed. For a lot of users, the local storage limitation isn't a big deal, as without applications, local storage isn't that critical... but it is nice for people who like to locally store music, photos, and movies, or who intent to install Crouton (or are looking ahead to the possibility of Android apps). The extra RAM, however, is great for everyone, as it makes this device more capable of running many tabs, or handling higher demand tasks like streaming content, without tabs crashing out or caching\/reloading. Fourth: Intel N3160 quad-core processor. This processor isn't exactly going to light the world on fire, but for most of what folks do with a Chromebook, it is going to be adequate, and it provides a user experience that feels significantly faster and more responsive than the N3050 on Windows 10 or Chrome OS, and is also more responsive in Chrome here than the x5-Z8300 is in Windows 10 (such as you'd see in the Intel Compute Stick or Asus E200HA). Fifth: $299. When you stack up all these strengths and offer them at a price of $299, you're getting a fairly impressive value proposition here with this Chromebook. The screen is great, for both media consumption and general computing\/web browsing; it offers a nice amount of local storage and solid performance via the Intel processor and 4GB of RAM, and it looks sharp, thanks to modern design queues and aluminum build materials. What's not to love here, right? Well........ I hate to be \"that\" guy, but there's a few things to pick at here. I keep reading comments along the lines of: \"Forget the Dell Chromebook 13 \/ Toshiba Chromebook 2 2015, this is the Chromebook to get!\" And for a lot of people, that's likely true, but I certainly won't say that's true as a blanket statement. Let's start with the Dell Chromebook 13. It has a smaller screen footprint, but is thicker and about the same weight, with a similar screen quality (and a tendency for backlight bleed); however, it packs a much more solid construction and a significantly more premium \"feel\" throughout, including its trackpad, keyboard, and overall feel in hand. It also has much better performance, including an easily upgraded M.2 SSD that has faster read\/write speeds and much more flexibility for those looking to install Crouton (to use Linux). That last part is a small subset of users, but it is still worth noting; however, the performance and build quality gap are very real and will be notable to all users. And, of course, the Dell can be purchased with an even faster Intel Core i3 or i5, and can also be upgraded to a touchscreen, which again may be significant if Android apps come to Chrome OS. What about the Toshiba Chromebook 2 2015? Things are less clear here; the Toshiba again has better performance, and uses a real SSD, but it has less impressive build quality and even less impressive materials; it does offer a backlit keyboard and an even nicer screen, still the nicest of these three. I think that a lot of Toshiba customers should probably consider the Acer, but those who were aboard the Dell train for its build quality and performance will likely still want to move forward with that device instead of this one; if I had to choose between the two, I'd likely go Dell... but then again, budget isn't my number one concern. At $300, this is a great purchase... ...which leads me to my next point, the omnipresent comments about \"This feels like a $1000 computer!\" or \"This is just like a MacBook Air for $300!\" The problem is that neither of those statements are close to accurate, and have to be chalked up to pure enthusiasm and excitement. For instance, the $799 Dell XPS 13 feels remarkably better to use than this Acer does, as it has smaller bezels, a much nicer trackpad, a much better (backlit) keyboard, and far faster web browsing and general performance. And while the Acer does resemble a MacBook Air 13 from a distance, when you compare them in-hand, any talk of them being similar will disappear. The Acer is very nice, to be sure, especially considering the price or $299, but tapping the trackpad results in a hollow response compared to the MacBook's assured sturdiness, and the keyboard lacks the superb feel and response you find in a MacBook keyboard. The Acer may copy the MacBook's style, but it doesn't approach it's premium feel when you actually use it. This isn't say the Acer is bad in the abstract; far from it. It has a nice, oversize trackpad that - like pretty much all Chromebooks - is responsive and a pleasure to use. And, its keyboard is comfortable if unremarkable. It also has pretty decent I\/O with two USB 3.0 ports, HDMI, and also 802.11ac WiFi. It does unfortunately lack an SD or Micro-SD card slot, however. I can't help but feel that people are also slightly exaggerating the performance offered by the N3160. It is solid, and does a decent job rendering pages, and paired with the extra RAM here, it adequately handles streaming content in the background - such as YouTube or Spotify - and still maintains a decent browsing experience across eight to ten additional tabs; but realistically speaking, this Chromebook offers slower performance than the $199 Acer C720 from late 2013. Octane 2.0 benchmarks I ran in Guest mode scored around 8,000 to 8,200 which, again, is not horrible, but isn't much more impressive than budget devices using the Rockchip 3288 from last year (like the $149 Hisense Chromebook). I only mention this because, in my opinion, you're getting about $300 worth of performance here; anyone telling you this device runs like a $500 or $800 computer is exaggerating. My Dell i3 Chromebook is much faster at loading tabs in general, especially busy ones like CNN.com, as is my MacBook Air 2014. There's a very real performance gap here when compared to more expensive devices, but also when compared to Chromebooks running on the Intel 2955U or 3205U\/3215U, which in the case of the latter Broadwell chips can churn out Octane scores nearly double what the Acer 14 offers. None of this means the Acer Chromebook 14 is a bad Chromebook; on the contrary, it is an excellent Chromebook! I led with those first five points for a reason: being able to purchase a decently-performing Chromebook with aluminum build, a 1080p IPS display, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of local storage, and an Intel quad-core processor for $299 is basically what the entirely of the ChromeOS subreddit has been asking for over the past few years; as such I have to tip my had to Acer and commend them on building a very nice Chromebook for the consumer space, one which should do a great job converting people to the idea of Chrome OS. That doesn't mean that I can't be disappointed in the lack of an SD card slot, the hollow feel and sound of the trackpad, the quite average keyboard, the feeling that the \"premium\" build quality is really just a nice \"coat of paint\" so to speak, the solidly average performance which is exceeded by devices 2.5 years old or matched by Chromebooks at half the price, the absence of a touchscreen upgrade, or the use of slower eMMC storage instead of a real M.2 SSD. These are all valid points that probably make this more of a 4.5 star device than a true 5 stars. Worth buying? Heck yes! But perfect? Not so much. And please, everyone, stop saying this is a $300 Chromebook that is nicer and faster than a $1000 MacBook or PC, because if you've really used those devices, you know it isn't true... even if it sounds great in a review.","For Chromebook fans, one persistent nagging issue has been the generally under-powered hardware for users who really push their machines - once you have a dozen or so tabs open with a half dozen extensions, many Chromebooks can start to slow down noticeably. Until now, the only option available has been the $1000 Pixel which is a beautiful PC but way beyond the budget for this kind of device. Acer has identified the Chromebook market gaps and solved almost everything in this extremely solid offering - a thin, metal, almost Mac-like build, armed with 4GB of RAM, a full 14\" HD display and a Quad-core CPU. Even the touchpad and keyboard perform as well as the very best Chromebooks currently available (which, until now, I would have said were built by Dell and Samsung). The performance never lags, it meets the 10-12 hour battery life promise in my usage tests, and it's quickly become my go-to computer for both home and work. If you're new to Chromebooks, here's what to expect from this Acer machine and the O.S. generally - these are genuinely 'instant-on' machines, highly secure and tightly integrated into Google's suite of apps and tools. Anything that runs in a Chrome browser on a desktop or laptop will run on a Chromebook, and there are novel app-like extensions for almost anything else (calculator apps, command lines, etc.) For an office, you can give everyone a Chromebook and their environment becomes available on login and disappears when they sign-out, and the machines can also be remotely managed if you're a Google Apps customer. For home users, these cheap machines fit many use cases from casual browsing and two-screening, to watching videos and calling family. They're ideal for elderly parents and in-laws who might other spam their own machines with malware since Chromebooks are much harder to break than a Windows 7\/8\/10 PC. For students and road warriors, the extended battery life and automatic cloud integration makes sync-ing a breeze, especially if you hotspot from your phone. And as with many other Chromebooks, this Acer also comes with some additional freebies such as 100GB of Drive space, Google Music and a dozen in-air Gogo passes (worth over $100 alone). As a 5-year Chromebook veteran, I've been waiting for this machine. It takes the basic premise of the simplicity and security of the Chrome O.S and matches it with high quality hardware at a value price. From the camera and audio quality through to the build styling, every aspect of this PC has been meticulously considered and it represents the best Chromebook that has been delivered to date","I'm a Software Engineer, and wanted a relatively cheap laptop that I could take with me, and at the same time, not have to worry about like I do with my $2000+ Mac Pro book.  I do a lot of development in the cloud, and make use of a lot of resources on the net, and so reasoned I didn't need to cart around a regular laptop.  Since I obviously do a lot of typing, I hoped for decent keyboard-- and was pleasantly surprised.  The keyboard on this unit is actually quite nice.  And let's be real.  The majority of things we do everyday on a computer is covered by a Chromebook, and it's large array of available apps and extensions (to Chrome).  Certainly for specialized uses, we can't completely untether ourselves from a full on laptop or desktop running Linux, OS X, or Windows.  But Chromebooks do fill a niche. I just received delivery of this, and set it up.  One thing I didn't like about Chromebooks that I've looked at in the past was their cheesy shells and keyboards, and the cost of a decent one.  This unit not only has a nice aluminum shell (which is very attractive), but it also has a decent keyboard, with much better tactile properties than any Chromebooks I've looked at in the past.  It actually looks and feels like a laptop, instead of some plastic toy. The hardware specs on this are very nice compared to other offerings:  4G Ram, 32G storage, Quad-core processor, etc.  The screen is beautiful, and the speakers are very nice.  Better in fact than some of my laptops.  The mouse area is responsive, and has a nice feel to it.  The overall unit has a slim profile, and is light weight. When I was comparing this model against other manufacturer's \/ model's, the only thing that made me pause was the lack of a card reader\/writer.  Ultimately, what I decided was that: (a) with google drive, microsoft drive, box, dropbox, etc., there is no good reason to require a reader\/writer, as I can simply save and download whatever I want from the cloud, and (b) 32GB is plenty of local storage for a Chromebook. Thus far, I am very happy with the purchase, and highly recommend it.","Decided to post a review after using this Acer nearly every day for 2 years. Using it primarily for email, browsing, and Google Docs.  I love it!! Why? Big screen; reliable (never crashes); USB and HDMI ports. I think biggest reason I like it is that it's sturdy and I don't mind throwing it in and out of my backpack whereas with a $1000 MB Air I might be a whole lot more careful in how I handle it. There is the random (once every 6 months) need for some application that it doesn't run but not a big deal for me. Speakers are meh but using headphones delivers crisp and clear sound. Hope to continue to get many more years of use out of it!","This is one of the best purchases I have made in years. As a Mac user for over 20 years, this is my first non-Apple computer and I love it. Since I already do all of my work in Google Drive, this is perfect for me. For those of you less familiar with Google Drive, I am able to seamlessly share and edit documents and PowerPoints with my co-workers. It's the best solution I've used for collaborating on a budget. However, know what you're buying before you get a Chromebook: it operates on a Chrome Operating System and you can't install apps or games on it like World of Warcraft. If you're okay with using web-based apps like Google Drive, keep reading. I initially bought this to reduce the wear and tear on my MacBook Air, but I now find it's better than my MacBook for Google Drive: faster boot up, much better battery life, and I'm less worried about banging it up. The battery life is incredible and charges from 0% to 100% in about an hour and a half while in use. Performance is hindered by slow connection speeds, so public WiFi can make work a bit slower. I love the look, weight, and feel of the laptop too. I will definitely be buying more Acer products in the future. 100% satisfied with this laptop.","First off the chromebook itself is excellent, one of the few budget models with 1080P and a long battery life. It arrived in \"as new\" condition despite being a refurbished (likely a return). It is a steal at $179 and worth a 5 star rating for the previous reasons. However, if you are someone who is very particular or sensitive to (minor) bait & switch internet sales tactics you should be aware of a possible issue when buying a refurbished model. There are two iterations of this chromebook the C5EX and the C5FM. The advertised model is the C5FM. You may, as I did, recieve the C5EX instead with a newly printed label slapped over the older C5EX label on the box (chromebook itself retains proper C5EX badging). This may sour some buyer's experience; however, there is only one functional difference between the two models. C5FM (the advertised model has an SSD) and the C5EX (model I recieved has eMMC). Yes, SSDs do have faster read\/write times, as well as, better and upgradeable firmeare than eMMC - so there IS a difference between the two models. But, honesty, for the intended use case of a budget chromebook (youtube, bill paying, amazon prime watching machine) this difference is negligible. If you plan to use this as a portable productivity device... perhaps look elsewhere.","DISCLAIMER:  First one we bought wouldn't charge and had to return it. Don't even care, it's that good.  Second one charged fine. Bought this for someone else, can't believe how good it is.  I'm a technical person, I run a combination of linux and windows between various computers.  Linux user since the mid 90s, program in several languages (from C to Python), can have a discussion about anything from fibre channel SANs to BGP to desktop GPUs or anything in between.  I'm also EXTREMELY picky about my tools (ie: I use exclusively Topre keyboards at home and at the office).  I'm not bragging I just want to explain why you should take my opinion seriously. Ok, with that out of the way:  holy !@#$ this thing is good.  Here's what you need to know: - All Aluminum - 14\" 1080p IPS display - 12 hours of battery - An ACTUALLY GOOD KEYBOARD AND TRACKPAD (I was spoiled by glass Macbook trackpads; I know a good trackpad) - Genuinely impressive performance with general web browsing and a handful of tabs This isn't a powerhouse, I've never pushed it, it probably wouldn't handle the 20+ tabs over multiple windows\/desktops that I'm used to on Chrome on the desktop, but for 99% of \"regular people\" this is an unbelievably good laptop.","Beautiful design! Super sleek and light weight. Screen quality is perfect and matte so no annoying glare! Only reason for the 4\/5 stars is the keyboard and processor. The keys on the keyboard are sunk in a little too low to accommodate for the sleek\/thin profile. It take a bit of getting used to. The processor on this Chromebook is one of the best you can get on a chromebook at this price (I did plenty of research), but you start to notice a lag when you have more than 3 browsers open at once. If you\u2019re streaming on Chromecast, you may notice lag when you open another window. Sort of annoying. Overall, it performs well enough for my daily internet needs. I use it mainly for chromecast and to check email.","There are several versions of the Acer Chromebook 14. Some versions are better than others. The advertised version, and the one I ordered, was the C5FM. The order confirmation indicated I was shipped the C5FM. I instead received the C5EM, which is inferior to the C5FM. I ended up returning it even after getting a credit because the wireless did not work well and was extremely slow. It's important to check the order carefully.","Would you really like to find out what molar-gnashing frustration feels like? Buy a chromebook! Then try to access your long files in Dropbox. I'm a writer who stores novel-length texts in Dropbox, and I purchased a chromebook for when I travel. The device itself is light and handsome - but virtually useless for long documents. There is some kind of arcane way to synchronize Google Drive (which is baked into Google's Chrome OS) and Dropbox, but it is definitely not intuitive. If you enjoy learning new cybernetic tricks, perhaps you might find this fun. I just want to access my long documents directly and easily so that I can get down to work when I'm away from home - but this machine sets up formidable obstacles for those used to working on a laptop or a pc. Chromebook is not a writer's friend.","worst decision i have made...and sad that this is my second acer..should have leared a lesson.  Customer service is useless..mostly from the Dominican Republic and their english is hard to understand.  This pc has gone  back and so called repaired!  I guess you get what you pay for..and this is not worth the money for a one year product... do not fall for the price..it is not worth the aggrevation, the lack of support and the problems that occur within a year ...DO NOT BUY","The build-quality is pretty good. I come from a long history of PCs and Macs. I currently own a MacBook Pro and a recent vintage iMac. Most of my comparisons will be from that frame of reference. Biggest gripe, no backlights on the keyboard. If it had backlights, my overall score for it would improve significantly. There is no delete key. I use the Gmail app an I cannot determine how to delete an email without using the trashcan icon and the trackpad. The keyboard is okay. The trackpad is mediocre in use. At one point I had high hopes that this would be a very stable platform, but after using it extensively, the minimize\/maximize controls disappear and applications cannot be easily closed and a reboot is required to restore normal operation. Most of the time it works very well and one is subject to the vagaries of the various apps, browser, etc. The speakers are mediocre and don't put out too much volume and are sensitive to position. I have yet to try it with headphones. I find the screen resolution to be very good for video. I really don't have much experience with other Chromebooks other than a few that were far worse in all respects than this machine. I was abled to find the Opera browser int he Google Play store, but Firefox as listed as not compatible. I can't really testify to its battery-life as I have not used it to the point where the battery is totally dissipated. All in all, I could live with this as my sole device if I had to.","As other reviews have mentioned - its a bit heavier than expected for such a slim frame. That being said - this is VERY slim! Love that part while still having a good number of ports. Specially having HDMI to be able to connect audio\/visual on the go for presentations (or movies!) is great! The chrome finish has a sleek and high quality feel to it which is nice. Seemless integration with my google apps & easy to download any other extensions\/apps needed for quick access. If you're anywhere near comfortable with Google apps\/products then transitioning to a chromebook should be very easy. My only wish is that it were a little more quick\/less laggy given it is a chromebook - but for the price point its a great buy. Thinking of possibly googling how to make a chromebook faster is a bit of a disappointment considering I didn't get a full computer to avoid those types of hassles. Overall, I'm definitely satisfied, I bought it wanting a well built laptop on the larger end (which is why I ultimately went with the 14 inch) with a solid material\/frame.","I'm having trouble with product quality from non Amazon suppliers. The laptop was shipped in what looked like a new case but upon opening it, it appeared used and repackaged. I went online and found that the 1 year Acer warranty had already expired. Also upon turning it on, I got a blue screen. The trackpad is awful as are most Acer trackpads. Screen is beautiful and that's the really the only plus point of this chromebook. I have a much older Toshiba chromebook that's a lot nicer to use from a keyboard and trackpad perspective.","Received this little chromebook last Friday as a handy tool for school and work. Everything is amazing, love the look and everything about it until now. Today I got to my apartment and decided to see how the computer fares with multiple monitors. Plugged it in, and all I see is purple on the second screen. Tried to change to difference monitors and different HDMI cables... same problem. What this tells me is that the HDMI port on my chromebook is defective. Will be sending this back for a replacement. I read a lot about people getting DOA versions of this product from the reviews and thought I got a pretty good one until now. Manufactures need to quality check their products before sending them out. Having these issues is very frustrating. Edit: Added a picture for the purple screen. The issue is not constant, after restart the HDMI port would work properly for an hour or so before returning to this purple screen. Either way, for a new product, this is a defective part sold by the manufacture. Edit 2: Received my replacement two days ago and finally opened it today. DoA. After logging in to the replacement, the screen flashes black every fives seconds and restart the chrome browser. Very disappointed. Added the video to show the problem.  Will be sending it back in for another replacement. I am very tempted to get a full refund as this point but the tiny book is used so much for work right now.","I was pretty excited about Chromebooks. They're like a little-known gem, practically unknown in my area, where Macs still rule. I borrowed a Chromebook before, and I was impressed with its speed and simplicity. I have mixed feelings about this Acer Chromebook. Like the other one I borrowed, this one feels streamlined and easy to use. It seems more intuitive than Macs or Windows. I like how it's so simple, without so much clutter and complexity. It's easy find and delete pics and files you've downloaded. Things don't get lost as easily, and you don't have to dig around for stuff as much as on a Mac or Windows computer. The keyboard and touchpad are awful on this Chromebook. Like other budget laptops, the keys feel cheap and uncomfortable. They have a low-quality, hard plastic feel and a weird textured grain to them. I wouldn't want to do any extensive typing on it. The touchpad is hard and clunky. Even using it a bit makes my hands\/wrist uncomfortable. This would be best used with a mouse. Doing general internet surfing is a breeze on this laptop. Overall, it works well and is easy to use. If you're mainly on YouTube or reading stuff online, this Chromebook functions well for that purpose. I still haven't figured out Google Cloud Print. I've Googled, but still haven't found an easy way to print. I've learned that most external devices, like printers and cameras, work best with Windows computers. With Macs and Chromebooks, you might run into a lot of problems and bugs. It's all integrated with your Google account, but I'd prefer to not have that. I suppose you can sign in without using your Google account, but I haven't tried that yet. Believe it or not, the webcam on this laptop DOES NOT have a video function! You can only take still pics with it. You can't Skype, video chat, or record video on this. Acer really tried to cut corners to keep this a budget laptop, and surprisingly, they decided to not have a video function on the webcam. This seems like almost a deal breaker for me, but I'm keeping this as a backup or additional laptop. There are extensions that have video, but I haven't found one yet that works well and can function as a typical laptop webcam. The video extensions tend to be productivity apps that you integrate with work-related stuff, with the video as one of the many functions on it. There's no easy and obvious way to use different browsers on this. There are extensions for IE and Safari, but then, they've failed to download on this Chromebook. I think they're blocking you from using other browsers. The extension industry seems to be very limited and subpar for Chromebooks. They are still a pretty small percentage of the computer market, so developers aren't spending the time or expense to develop good, usable Chromebook extensions for obvious things. I'm still keeping this as a backup or additional laptop because of its cheap price. It's still good for basic internet usage. PROS: Streamlined and simple; easy to use overall; easy to find\/delete pics & files; good price; looks nice from the outside, with the lid down; good 14\" screen size that's surprisingly hard to find CONS: Webcam doesn't have video - only takes pics; awful, uncomfortable keyboard & trackpad; Chromebook extensions are lacking and don't address\/make up for the limitations of this Chromebook; a bit heavy and clunky; hard to figure out Google Cloud print","This is my first chromebook so I have nothing to compare it to. Build quality seems excellent. I purchased mine in the gold color and its beautiful. Beautiful ips display. I'm running it at 2500x1400 resolution Extremely thin and lightweight. Chicklet style keyboard takes a little getting used to but its nice. For those reviewers complaining about no capslock button all you do is use the shift key. Also for those reviewers complaining about no sd card support is nonsense. I'm using a Samsung Fit 64gb usb drive.Its tiny and protrudes out from the device less than a half of an inch and is faster than any sd card.Little bit of a learning curve with chrome os. Once you figure it out its a much more enjoyable device. Ive got all my favorites on the bookmark bar and all my app shortcuts on the shelf. Now it kind of feels a little bit like windows but still different. I have one of the fastest routers on the market and this is the fastest device I have ever used. I'm running it on the developer channel and have full access to the play store. Just can't figure out how to enable my google now cards yet. If your a gadget geek like me or just looking for a premium chromebook without the premium price just buy it. Every professional review on the internet concludes this is by far the most bang for your buck and I couldn't agree more. :) UPDATE: For starters ignore D.Freedmans emotionally biased, clueless review below. After spending some time in the play store here's what s going on. I open up chrome and click on the google app and there is all my google apps including the play store. I click on the play store app and go right in. I click on an app and click install and the device thinks for a few seconds then a device window pops up with a list of devices I previously owned lol. No chromebook in the list. I click on install and it then says app will be installed later. So it appears the play store does not recognize this devise at this time. Google is almost there. Remember I'm on the developer channel NOT in developer mode. Two different beasts there. I'll update when theres an update. UPDATE: Device now has full support for the play store on the beta channel. I also finally got my google now cards. This makes this chromebook closer to a real computer. Couldn't be happier.","I actually found this Chromebook while helping a friend research a new laptop for herself. It really hit all the marks we were looking for. I hadn't had a Chromebook before so I wanted to give it a try and at this price (around $250 at the time) it made sense to pull the trigger. It has surpassed both our expectations. First, getting a quad core processor and a 32GB SSD. Add in the INCLUDED 100GB of Google Drive storage and it's really perfect We knew when we bought them that this model was getting Google Play Store access (keep in mind not all Chromebooks are getting that) and was pleasantly surprised by also getting the Linux VM support that just came out. IT's a great size to throw into a backpack and a solid build quality (all metal) that I don't worry about it getting damaged on my commute. So why 4 stars? Frst, it would have been incredible to have a MicroSD card slot. Secondly, I can't put my finger on it, maybe it's an anti-glare screen that ever so slightly mutes colors, but it's not my favorite device to watch media on. Granted, on a laptop this price, you aren't going to get a Retina or Molecular display like Apple or the new Pixel Slate. But that's the 1 star drop. Otherwise, it's more than I ever thought I could have expected.","I don't know how Acer did it. Aluminum, excellent keyboard, phenomenal IPS display, nice and hefty weight, USB 3.0's, HDMI port, Bluetooth, this computer just screams quality. And all for ~$275. They must save all the money not having to load windows on these things. Acer deserves some sort of medal for this laptop. Excellent job.","Ok, so you've probably read the other reviews and read the description. You know the basics about the specs. All you want to know is if it can use the google playstore and apps. Yes it can. The second time I turned it on it updated and it added the google play store.","A week after arrival the screen began  blacking out, at first for a few seconds then I had to close the lid to get it to light up and then restart. THEN I kept getting error messages \"Oh, Snap....\"  began. This happened 7 times within 20 minutes when I was working on something.  They want you to give them feedback. I wanted to \"snap\" them. Let me add this computer is only used lightly.  I am returning immediately, no patience for this.","I promptly installed linux via crouton on it and I'm actually doing serious work on it. Trackpad is not the best, but I can live with that. Might want to get an external mouse for serious work. Some people list as one of the cons, that there is no sd card reader.. but hey, I just got one of those low profile 64GB sandisk flash drives for less than $20 and the inconvenience is minimal.. UPDATE: 6 months later: I absolutely love this thing - one of the best computers that I've ever owned, in some respects, so it saddens me that some keys are starting to give out: First ESC (I'm a VI user..), then backspace, and now N, of all things. I guess all high-frequency keys (for me). They all work if I hit them harder (I'm a pretty gentle typist), but it is pretty debilitating.. I've been treating this computer very well. Never took a fall or spill or anything. If I cleaned it up it would look like the day I unpacked it. I know it's still under warranty, and I guess if more keys get dysfunctional, I really need to send it back. I guess since it's a chromebook, it's not to hard getting up and running on a new one..","We bought this for our Mom's 92nd birthday because her old computer was so outdated that it took her a half hour just to get it to load. She loves her computer for ordering books for her Kindle from the library and for \"traveling the world\" vicariously.  She absolutely loves the speed and how easy it is for her to use.  If she has an issue, she can call me and I can easily talk her through it since I have a very similar model.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a computer that doesn't require maintenance.  Updates and protection are automatically updated, so Mom doesn't need to be reminded to take care of those things anymore.  Did I say she loves it???  Yes, yes, yes!!!","A month or so ago, the screen on my Toshiba Chrome 2 was broken (no fault of the computer, just someone slamming it shut in anger), necessitating its replacement. This Acer is the third computer that I bought in replacement, so I feel I'm in a pretty good position to judge where it stands relative to what else it out there right now. I'm a Chrome OS early adopter, having bought one of the early Chromebox's that were given out at the Google I\/O off of eBay, and having bought my Toshiba Chromebook a couple of years ago. I'm somewhat sold on Chrome, the feature I like best about them is that the continuous updating and cleaning up of the OS. My Chromebox is about four years old and it works better now than when I bought it, and that's with zero attention paid to updating\/upgrading\/virus protection\/etc. ever. It \"just works\" and it doesn't stop just working. So my first choice was the SUS C300SA-DS02 Chromebook 13.3\" HD, which sells for about $225 on Amazon. It wasn't a horrible computer, but it looks and feels very cheap and underpowered. So I sent it back and instead ordered an ASUS ZenBook UX305UA 13.3-inch. It was of course much nicer, and I was looking forward to putting Windows Office on it so that I could get some more work functionality out of it. But I was amazed to learn that ASUS Windows laptops, apparently all of them, lock the function keys in such a way that you have to simultaneously press the function key in order to perform their non-function functions (i.e. if you press \"F12\" by itself you get the developer's code window rather than volume up), and it cannot be changed. It's hardwired into the computer, not even opening the BIOS can change it. That was a plain non-starter for me, I'm constantly fiddling with volume and brightness controls on my laptops, so having that as a two-hand operation . . . no way. So . . . reconsidering also the extremely marginal functionality of native Windows Office as opposed to Google Docs\/Office Online, I decided to go back to another Chromebook, but this time the Acer Chromebook 14. Boy am I glad I did! This computer looks and feels like a $1000 laptop. It's a beautiful, solid all-metal device, with a nice, wide great looking screen. The trackpad works well, and the internals seem to be very quick, I haven't noticed any stuttering on anything as of yet. My only quibble might be with the keyboard, which is a bit shallow for my tastes, but it's decent enough. At $300 even, you'd be crazy to settle for one of the $200+ Chromebook when a vastly better machine can be had for just a little bit more. If you're looking for a computer in the range of this size and price and functionality, I would recommend this one.","This is the first chromebook I have had! I have had a Windows computer, and I am an avid Apple Mac lover and user! This chromebook is a beauty, love the gold color! This Acer 14 Chromebook is snappy! Comes on quick and shuts down quick! Switches between pages quick! I am learning how to use it, the only thing is that I just wanted to transfer some things over from my mac to the chromebook by using a flash drive, I actually had to just open google docs and make tables and add all the information. Took a bit, but I think it will work well! I have only had this for a few days, and have been at work, so not to much time to learn all! But so far, I like it! I did order a 128 gb flash drive for the Acer chromebook for storage! I don't like the idea of paying Google Drive for storage, I can take my flash drive with me for access to my files. The webcam isn't all that good, and Skype on here is not the best! I tried to Skype with my mom last night and she said that the video was not good at all, and after a bit she froze up on my end. She will share her screen with me so I can help her with her Macbook air, and she tried to and it would not share on my end. Oh well,  I do have an iMac and an iPad that I can use, and I can also Skype on my phone! I will adjust to the changes between Mac and Chromebook. I did also have to adjust to Mac from Windows and fell in love with Mac. I will probably end up loving chromebook also! I mainly purchased the chromebook to see if and when my husband and I would be able to switch from Mac to Chromebook! We have had our Macs since 2009 and no issues other than my iMac needing a hard drive, after 7 years of use. My husbands MacBook pro, no issues! I am hoping that we will be able to do everything that we normally do on our macs, on the chromebook! Update 2-27-17  I have had this Acer now for just about 2 weeks and am learning how to work all the things I was trying to do before! I just took my usb flash drive and uploaded into google sheets and there it all was. I am just in love with this Chromebook! I could have several setting around me and would be so happy! I have it on all the time I'm home and wished I could take it with me when I go to work, (But I would not get anything done at work for being on this). I would highly recommend this Acer 14 Chromebook! UPDATE 12\/29\/18 I still use my Acer daily! It is still quick in response, start up and shut down, switching between pages are quick! You would never think that I have had it for about 2 years! A windows computer would have been slowed down! I would say that you still need a regular computer for certain tasks, like for us it would be for getting into our Apple airport and maybe printing pictures! But this chromebook is awesome for daily use! I love it!","The pros: Awesome little computer, you can do quite a bit. It holds a charge for forever, and recharges super quickly. It is so lightweight, and I am really impressed with how much I can do, for such a great low price. The cons: Just be aware that this is not compatible with Microsoft office, and with a lot of printers. I have to buy a new laptop for work that it can handle more. I have had mine for a while now, and all of my office managers have them, but mine is starting to slow wayyyy down, and I don't like that it doesn't have very much storage. Overall, awesome personal laptop, or for offices where the user doesn't need to do much offline. I love this laptop, and I totally would recommend it, but if you are looking for something for work, that needs to handle a lot; spend the extra money to get something a little heftier.","I didn't feel like paying an arm and a leg when my 9-year old macbook finally bit the dust so I was looking for a cheaper alternative to basically just surf the web on. After reading a lot of reviews I decided to go with this Acer Chromebook. I've had it for about 3 months now and have been very happy with the purchase. It was a very easy switch from a macbook to this chromebook as this is very user friendly. There are a few things to have to get use to (aka not having a hard drive), but it's been great for my needs. The only flaw I've noticed saw far is that when my sound is on mute (which is about 95% of the time) and I click on a website that automatically has a video or sound playing it makes this weird type of electrical screeching\/squeaking noise. I've tried to research and see if anyone else has had this issue but haven't seen anything else about it. It doesn't effect the performance, just annoying I suppose.","I bought this chromebook 1 month ago.  I lost the cursor this morning and called Acer to get help.  They instructed me how to powerwash it.  That instruction still did not fix the problem. I am returning it today.","If you know anything about chromebooks, you know they aren't really helpful unless you are connected to a network. That being said, I'm going to skip over that being a 'flaw' because I don't see it as one. I bought this machine over a year ago, and I couldn't recommend it any higher than I already do. Having worked in many schools that utilize chromebooks, this is by far the best I've used for the price I paid. The performance is fast, the screen has held up and gives perfect clarity for watching HD videos, and I can't see the pixels no matter how hard I try. For a small system, the processing power has provided virtually no lag, and since the update allowing the google play store to download many useful apps, I've used this chromebook nearly everyday for both school and work. If you are looking for a high quality system that will last a long time (even the battery is amazing), then I recommend you buy this.","Docking and undocking my work PC is a PITA, it never recovers correctly so I often have to reboot, and it's a little bulky.  I was going to go with a iPad or similar to have portablility back for meetings and such but didn't want to drop the cash and also wanted something with more of a keyboard.  After looking around I decided I wanted to try a chromebook with 4Gb\/32Gb combo for $200 or less.  I couldn't find that anywhere and most models were 768 resolution,I was about to give up on chromebooks.  Then this guy showed up with ram and storage I was looking for, 1080 screen and aluminum slim chassis was a huge plus in my opinion which convinced me to bump my budget $50.  I was looking at Dells offerings and they were thick plastic, to get what I wanted kept pushing me to $300+ plus range, and had trouble finding a screen better than 768.  The Acer was a no brainer for me.  When I unboxed it, I noticed it had more bulk than I was expecting, nothing terrible, weight seems to be toward the hinge, must be where the battery is located.  The aluminum is cold to the skin at first touch, but much better conductor for cooling I would imagine than plastic.  I am a guy with no patience for slow PCs so I was leary about what I was getting myself into with a chrome book.  It is surprisingly quick to boot and sleep\/awaken, something Windows still struggles with.  Google play store has all the apps I use in Windows and I have only had for a few days so I am still honeymooning with it but so far I like it a lot.  I spent quite some time streaming Youtube with its first full charge and I had at least a full 8 hours out of it, I would suspect if I was just browsing and didn't have the display cranked I could have gotten more.  I was also impressed with the sound quality that it had while watching videos.  I have a strange new obsession watching train crossings live on youtube lately and the trains look clear and the horns sounded authentic, I had to turn it down so I didn't anger the wife watching TV.  The display is crisp and has a wide viewing angle, it doesn't have that funky LCD color fade if the screen is tilted the wrong direction slightly and is somewhat matte to reduce glare.  The keyboard has shallow keys that take a little getting used to and the mouse pad takes a little more pressure than I think it should need to click so sometimes I need to take an extra half second to realize I need to push harder.  I have converted to tapping the pad instead of clicking because it easier, right clicking is accomplished with using a two finger tap.  Only thing I really wish it had was illuminated keyboard, but that can be remedied with a USB light for $10 which will likely affect battery life, it's kind of cheesy solution but for the price point I think I am asking a lot.  I have recommended this to people I know and I would also to you, I don't think you will find anything better than this for the price today.  Just remember it is a Chromebook and not a full PC it has some limitations but I have been impressed with its performance.  I loaded Hearthstone just to see how it would run, it had long load times but once I was into the game the motion was fluid, the audio clear and I began to forget I was on a chromebook.  I have an Alienware 15r2 at home, comparing the two I was impressed that the chromebook was able to keep up.  Certainly it had lower frame rates, less visual effects and much longer load times, but the game was still good looking, smooth and playable.  I wouldn't run anything crazy on this but for what it is I was impressed.  If you are on the fence, give a shot, I think you'll like it.  (images taken with iPhone of screen in dark room, looks better in person)","I have an older much less expensive ACER Chromebook and use it several hours a day. However, the it hangs when I load it down with a many open Chrome tabs, apps, extensions, etc. So, I bit the bullet and upgraded to the Chromebook 14. I really like it. I miss the SD card slot and actually I prefer the keyboard on my old model, but the Chromebook 14 is faster, has not hung once, and the display is much nicer (clearer, larger). I played Amazon Videos, worked great. Games, great. MS Word Online and Google Docs, great. The aluminum chassis is nice, not quite as cool as my wife's Macbook Air, but it is 4x the cost. The hinged cover is not as cool as the chassis, and I would prefer not to have the ACER insignia protruding from the top cover. But, hey... I think $300 is too much to spend on a Chromebook, but I would do it again in a heartbeat.","This is a great laptop for anyone who is looking for a device that will allow them to go on YouTube, Facebook, check their email, or various other casual sites. I got it for my mother to replace her former Windows laptop, and she is by no means a computer savvy person but has had no problem adapting to the Chrome OS. Its easy to use, and very lightweight, making for browsing to be a snappy and fast experience. The solid state drive storage makes powering the device on and off very quick, but the small storage capacity means you won't be able to pack a lot of files or any large applications on the device. For anyone looking to simply browse the internet and perform relatively light duties, this laptop is a lightweight, fast device made of aesthetically nice materials and an excellent choice for most folks who need a computer.","After 5 moths of very light use the the laptop stopped reading the SSD and is useless.  Also on this model the SSD is not replaceable. Acer recertified only has a 90 day warranty and since it was bought from a third party seller on amazon that 90 day warranty does not even apply.","It's good for basic web, and HDMI to a big screen. Acer has pretty good visual and capacity for streaming film (we clear caches after every film). Good but not great audio for watching films. Speakers under keyboard is not ideal. Came with one faulty pixel on my screen, like a dot on an i, don't notice it when working on docs, but a constant dot on films. Chromebooks are Google-based. You can get some but not all Android apps. They are more like fancy tablets with bigger keyboards.  They do not have a lot of storage capacity of their own. This Acer has many ports, so a memory card or USB device is easy. Plus or minus? ** Cannot load Firefox or many other apps ** or customize apps. Bluetooth not reliable. Privacy is risky. These are fine as a second or third or fourth tool in a tech home, and might be very good as a tool for older users who want a larger keyboard and screen than a phone or tablet, and\/or casual users to link to a smart TV or other gear. They do not offer enough security or flexibility for many people who do web work. imo. If you think of it as a big tablet with a nicer keyboard, you will be happy. If you think of it as a laptop trimmed around the edges, you should know what is trimmed.","Am having trouble with power cords.  Either the Acer is defective or the power cords;  If you move the laptop 1\/2 inch the power cord falls out.  Tried taping it on.  Worked for short while, 10 minutes then stops recharging.  The only way I can get it to charge is by holding in place with pinger to get it to make condition.  The acer is already starting to heliste all the time.  I will be typing away and realize even though I have placed cursor in firht place noting I am typing is transferred to screen.  I believe I have square trade warranties on both .....First tried the HP twice then wehn to Acer hoping for better results and it appears to be worse. The square trade deals cost almost as much as what you are buying......Amazon needs to  get better reliaable vendors  Well here we go again.......cannnot get the power cord to activate compiuter.  I am at mu wit's end.","As a long time Chromebook user, I found this laptop to be a real marvel.  It is fast, provides an easy setup, and the screen image is perfect. If you spend most of your online time checking on FB or reviewing email or general surfing, this is your best bet.  You are not going to find a better laptop for less than $300.  Love Windows?  Forget it.  This laptop is the Apple for those who can't lay out the big bucks that an Apple requires. The build is quality throughout and it has a very classy look.  Lack of Window's viruses is a real plus.  If your old laptop is getting a bit clunky, freezes up on you with multiple tabs open, this Chromebook with 4GB Ram is the answer to your problem.","Our first experience with Acer (but not our first Chromebooks), and so far, it's a good one. Fit and finish The aluminum case feels quite a bit sturdier and more rigid than our previous Chromebooks having molded plastic cases. There is a slight wire-edge along one side of the lower case of one of the two units we ordered, thankfully not sharp enough to cause cuts, but slightly annoying in normal use.  Beyond that, however, the case is nicely constructed. The hinge appears to be nearly full-length design, a plus over the small hinges used on some laptops. The display is sharp and bright, colors appear reasonably accurate. Native resolution appears to be 1536 x 864. Keyboard is your standard \"chiclet\" type. Features There are two USB3 ports and an HDMI port on the left side. Power and charging LEDs, headphone jack, and charging connection are on the right side. Speakers are downward firing, which means the sound performance is highly influenced by the surface on which the machine is used. The touch-pad is quite large and adequately responsive. There's also a camera and mic located in the top screen bezel. I'd have preferred three USB ports being available, as that would allow for an external wired keyboard and mouse while still leaving a port free for things like a USB-to-Ethernet adapter and\/or a USB stick. This is an especially notable lack, when one also notices that there is no SD card slot, thus making the machine's larger 32GB SSD that much more important. The charging connector and charger I found disappointing. The charging connector is tiny and might therefore be quite fragile for such a constantly used item. Coupled (often literally) with that is a large, clunky, right-angle molded connector, separated by only about an inch and a half from a molded-in ferrite choke. In actual use, this means the the charging cord is awkward. Setting the Chromebook down to charge results in the cord's choke often ending up under the machine. The short section of cord from connection to choke often ends up being bent at quite an acute angle, which I suspect may cause premature failure of the cord. The charger has a separate AC cord, which, depending on one's preferences, might be either a pro or a con. I have noticed that the charger gets quite hot under initial charging when the battery is quite low. Performance Most of the items I have noted above are really quite minor, and many are highly dependent on one's use case or preference. The Chromebook performs just fine, start up is typically fast, and I noticed no significant slow-downs when having a fair number of tabs open. This Chromebook supports Android applications, so the range of available Apps is broad. I had occasion to test out my USB-connected Wacom tablet with Adobe's Photoshop Sketch Android app and found it to work very well. The Acer detected and activated the tablet without any input from me required. Overall, I recommend this Chromebook. It's reasonably priced, and pleasant to use. For most people, it should be a more-than-adequate choice.","Pros- Sturdy. I dropped this on a hard floor yesterday and it still performs perfectly.   Large screen- This screen is big enough to have 2 functional windows open at one time.   Power- I can have multiple tabs open at once with no lag   Keyboard- The keys are very responsive and easy to type with.   Weight- Lightweight enough to keep on my lap and not feel uncomfortable.   Cool to touch- no uncomfortable heat when you have it in your lap.   Battery- While I don't get near the stated battery life, it charges very quickly. Cons- Screen- Too dark even at the brightest setting. Also, there is a marked difference in how bright the screen is when it is charging vs unplugged   Sound- The speakers aren't loud enough if there is any other noise in the room.   Bluetooth- Technically, this has Bluetooth, but it's not very functional. This is my biggest complaint. I like to have a movie on when I'm  working in the kitchen. It's impossible to hear dialog when the fan is on or the dishwasher is running. When I use the Bluetooth headphones that worked perfectly fine with my Samsung Chromebook, the sound starts to sputter even if I'm standing right next to the computer.   Jack and USB placement- I wish everything was on the left side, or at least on the same side. I looked at getting a wireless headset, but they are all designed to have the headphone jack and USB ports next to each other. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase. This is probably the most functional and durable Chromebook for under $300.","First off, I love Chromebooks!! By far the best OS I've ever run....well I've never owned a Apple so can't compare to them... I bought this to replace a Asus 13.3 which was my first Chromebook....had it for a couple years, never slowed down like Windows, but something went wrong with the screen....Tried replacing the screen, but something in it wasn't right, like a loose wire or something...So I gave up on fixing it and ordered this Acer... I've seen some reviewers not liking the keyboard, but I really like it!! The battery is awesome! Only thing was this don't have a SD slot...but I had a card reader that plugs into the USB port....uploaded some pictures to Google Photo's and noticed that by using the card reader in the USB port the pictures upload much faster....so it turned out for the best!! Only time will tell how well this laptop will hold up! But I know the Chrome OS is fantastic and won't slow down in time like Windows OS will...plus no need for anti-virus is another big plus and the price...","My employer uses this model for most of their employees in their Canadian office.  My daughter wanted a Chromebook for writing and publishing short stories.  I asked around at work and most of the people using this model were happy with it, so I bought it.  The kid has been using this since Christmas 2018 and is very pleased with it.  No networking issues, no mouse\/track pad issues, no problems with the built in softwares, and the battery still lasts all day without recharging.  She says she'd recommend this Chromebook to others. Back story on my daughter's computing skills.  She has been using Linux computers since she was four years old.  She had an aptitude for administering Linux, Windows, and Mac computers by the time she finished 2nd grade.  She started programming HTML, Java, and Python when she was in the 5th grade.","I was leery about buying this because I thought it was too good to be true. Also, it seemed to have already been out a while judging by the dates from the other reviews. I currently am a graduate student and also work from home. The software I use at work is a pretty heavy database and my surface 3 couldn't handle it. I need something fast, but also slim and cool enough to use in my lap in bed, in public, and wherever else I may need it. I also own a gaming laptop with an i7, 12 gigs of ram, and a solid-state drive as my primary computer. Because of Google's efficient OS, this computer nearly matches it in speed and performance when surfing the web and using my company's software. I am currently writing this review with 12 other tabs open and it's powering through just fine. I've currently got my graduate school's website open, a PDF, my work's software, as well as 3 facebook tabs. The design? Amazing. Keys are a bit shallow but still pleasant to type on. The trackpad is the best i've used in ages and rivals Apple's. There's a bit of flex in the lid, yeah, but it's 300 dollars. The aluminum seems to be pretty durable and it runs cool. The screen is really crisp, colors are a bit muted but again - it's 300 dollars and it's very good considering. This has better speakers than my 1300 dollar laptop. No, there isn't any bass but it's very clear and if you need to hear dialogue (like I do for work and school), you don't have to use headphones all the time. Overall, I'm very pleased. I would buy it again in a heartbeat. I can't comment on it's longevity and reliability, as I've only owned it 3 weeks. But, so far I'm very impressed!!","This chromebook is stylized in a beautiful aluminum shell, with its beauty it brings great features and a great simple experience. PROS: -sturdy aluminum shell -phenomenal battery life that can survive school , up to 12 hrs -full HD 1080p display -usb 3.0 ports , hdmi port and Bluetooth support -supports android apps via the App Store Sort of cons: clearly it doesn\u2019t use programs from windows since it\u2019s a chromebook. However as long as there\u2019s an android app version or online version of the software you need to use you\u2019re fine. If the software you need is not available on the chrome web store or the playstore you can try using crossover for chromebook to add a compatibility layer to run Windows programs.","This Acer blew my expectations away.  I am extremely happy with how this Acer operates and how smooth it is.  It is also extremely fast compared to my old Dell laptop.  I went to Best Buy and looked around and played with a few other options they had and this definitely seemed to be the winner.  The reason I got this on amazon though was due to the fact this Acer came with more option and the rose gold color was a plus.  I got the Rose Gold but I was kind of skeptical of the color. However when I opened it up though, I was completely in love with how it looked and it wasn't too gody of a color.  I would definitely recommend this computer to somebody who wants a good reliable laptop for the price as long as they aren't doing anything crazy on it like programming or something.  It is an easy to use computer for every day tasks such as looking up things on the web to typing out pages of homework.","Until recently, I was very satisfied with this laptop.  Two months ago it began to disconnect from my wireless network whenever the lid was closed or whenever it was inactive for several minutes.  It isn't the router.  All other devices work fine and don't disconnect.  To reconnect, I have to double-click on the network icon and then click on my specific network.  I haven't been able to find a fix.  It's very annoying. Since I wrote the first paragraph of this review, the disconnect problem has gotten worse.  The Acer now disconnects from the router every few minutes.  There is nothing wrong with the router.  My husband's PC has no problems, and it is connected to the same router.","Warning.!!!  If you buy an Acer product, turn it on and run into a problem, Acer will require a Credit Card number to charge, just to talk to you.  It happened to me about 2 hrs after opening my newly purchased Chromebook.  After turning it on and logging into my google account I was getting an error when trying to run Chrome.  From my Toshiba chrome book I looked up and called the support phone number, \"Acer help site | (866) 695-2237\".  After navigating through their IVR menus I made it to a customer service rep.  Before he would even talk to me, he told me that Acer requires a credit card number to charge for the help.  Thinking I reached a scam help desk, I call 1-866-661-7100, the number that came in the box with the chromebook.  Surprise, surprise, after navigating it's IVR menu, again the customer service rep required a credit card number.  After hanging up on that rep, I did a quick google search regarding my issue and was able to resolve it on my own.  I'm considering sending this back to Amazon and file a formal complaint. Aside from that, it's a functioning web browser.  A bit faster and has more memory than  my Toshiba.  What more do you really expect. We'll It's been a few weeks now with this Chromebook now, aside from the initial issue, no problems.  I do like the screen on this, images are clean and crisp, enjoying the 4 gigs of ram which allow me to have a few more tab open.","This thing is totally awesome!!!!!!!!!  Just get a wireless mouse and keyboard and an HDMI cable.  Plug the HDMI into your TV and you have a giant screen.  I never even have to touch the chromebook or open the lid.  I keep the charger plugged in and on a timer to give it a 30 minute charge once a day.  It stays inside a wooden trunk 24\/7 and the wireless keyboard and mouse easily connect quickly.  It's an excellent set up for helping kids with schooling and any other types of learning while the whole family can see it all together on a jumbo screen.  You can pass the keyboard and mouse around the room to anybody while never having to touch the laptop or worry about dropping it, spilling anything on it, or tripping on cords.  It also connects to your phone so you can text through your TV, just download Mighty Text on your phone and chromebook.  It's pretty cool.  It doesn't have a CD drive, but if you need one then just get a laptop and use the same configuration.  Acer seems to make great products.  It is very thin and light weight as well.  Highly recommend you pick one up, you'll love it.  It's very easy to learn to use, just like an android phone platform pretty much.","Bought this computer on Prime Day for a good price.  I'm using it solely for web browsing.  I keep a lot of tabs open, but no gaming, not too many videos, streaming etc.  For that, it's great.  It's really light and thin, and I think the display is fine for my purposes.  I'm using to replace \/ suppliment a windows laptop that took FOREVER to boot up.  I think for someone who wants a light, cheap laptop to surf and use google docs on, this is great.  The touchpad doesn't have a button on it to right click, that is sort of annoying but otherwise I'd recommend this computer.","This is a great piece of tech for the price. Worth the buy. EXTERIOR: The laptop itself is solid, sleek, and most importantly, lightweight. The track pad is spacious, allowing freedom of movement. The keyboard isn't my favorite; not backlit and not as tactile and clicky as I would like it. It's quiet, muted, and doesn't have a lot of travel. It's ideal for those who prefer a low profile laptop without the added noise. The screen is full 1080 HD, very clear, and can get very bright, or extremely dim. The stated battery life is 12 hours, but after charging it up to 100%, it said there was roughly 10 hours left. If on the lowest brightness levels, you could probably push 12-13 hours no problem. INTERIOR: Although the stated processing speed is around a modest 1.6 Ghz, topping off at 2.24 Ghz, it manages to deliver a slick and speedy experience. I am currently writing this review with 8 tabs open, pandora and youtube in the background, with no added lag. With 4 GBs of RAM, this should be able to handle all of your everyday task without a problem. EXTRAS: With this Chromebook, you get access to a free 2-year 100 GB addition to your Google Drive account.","When I first received this chromebook, it had a technical glitch and the screen would go black for several seconds at a time. I contacted Amazon for an exchange, which was extremely easy to do, and I received a new chromebook within a matter of days. I couldn't be happier with it now - it is perfect for what I need it for (light web browsing & class notes). I like that this chromebook has a larger screen, so it feels more like a real laptop, but is still lightweight to lug around campus all day. A full charge easily lasts for easily 8-12 hours in use, and even longer if asleep. This obviously would not work as your sole computer - I have a desktop iMac, and this chromebook is a great addition for mobility.","This is the 5th Acer product I have purchased, and the first Chromebook.  I have to tell you, this is probably the best computer I have owned in the last 20 years.  Since everything I do to run my business is online (including Google Docs), I have no need for a bunch of various software that I do not use like I would get bundled with a Windows computer. This Chromebook is super light, super thin, super portable, and the aluminum chassis is sleek, stylish, and durable at the same time.  It seems incredibly fast and intuitive, and starts up in a flash.  I really can't see myself needing any other computer for my business.  If you're looking for something for school or work, this is probably one of the best bargains you'll find for how fast and powerful it is.","Very good relative price for a small and light web browsing device. I thought that I would have no need for a touch screen (don't want one). However, I have found that some Google Play store Android apps don't want to install or run on this (they did work on my smaller, lower resolution C100P). I can run an RDP client full screen, a VMware Horizon View client. MS O365 apps run fine. And of *course* chrome runs great. Wifi seems good on this device. Not a super fast device for complex websites. The screen isn't very sharp, but for the price it is acceptable. The sound quality is mediocre, but for the price it is acceptable. Having this inexpensive, no moving parts device for road trips is great. I can remotely connect to VDI or RDP in a pinch. Can watch YouTube, and Amazon Prime via WiFi at a hotel. Wish the trackpad had a right click feature instead of having to remember to hold \"ALT\" while clicking.","I've been using this constantly since I bought it, it is so much better than the inexpensive one I had first. It is serving me well in every way, but I don't have any technical knowledge, so I can't \"speak that language\". All I can say is that I was surprised at how heavy it seemed after using my old (smaller by at least 1\") Samsung. Also there is a little 'rim' on the bottom edge created by the top of the keyboard fitting into the bottom of the case. It is uncomfortable when I use the chromebook on my lap, in bed, which I do rather frequently as I am often bed-bound by necessity. It is just an annoyance, not really a problem. And I assume the heavier weight is due to :)  (Much more powerful hardware in there?) or a sturdier case and of course that extra inch of screen size. I am loving this machine.. Oh, and the HD screen? It's a pleasure watching streaming video. Big gripe about Chromebook OS.... it is not pairing with my bluetooth speaker made by \"iHome\". I read on the net that this is a fault in OS software for chromebook, though I haven't explored other options with tech support. Good luck to any other buyer with this issue. The speaker in the machine is typical of laptop speakers, in other words, sucks. Thus the missing star in my review. I can use my iHome speaker hardwired with the Chromebook so that is an option. Good Luck","After reading all of the reviews, I took the plunge into the world of Chrome book and ordered this one.  With the  notion that set up would be a breeze, I ended up spending an entire day, on and off with ACER tech support, I packaged it back up and sent it back.  Although the tech support folks were polite enough, I had difficultly understanding their English, which made it even more of a challenge. The computer would not allow me to get passed the initial set up page.  They questioned my Modem and Router. so I also talked to Linksys Router support and Spectrum trying to discern the culprit.  Ultimately, the ACER folks decided that I had a hard-ware issue with the Chromebook. They did offer to repair it, but I certainly had no intentions of accepting a refurbished product.  Frustrating and wasted day.","I bought this to replace an aging laptop that was only used for web browsing and word processing.  Almost all basic tasks (even photo touch-up) can now be done within google's online ecosystem, so this was a no brainer.  I've used other chromebooks that just felt kind of cheap and plasticky.  This one has a really nice build quality and feels solid.  The screen is crisp and the color quality and viewing angle are both good.  The touchpad takes a little getting used to (it looks like it should be as nice as an apple touchpad but in terms of feel it is just not quite there).  I have yet to use it down to an empty battery, so can't really comment on it's actual capacity, but for several hours of uninterrupted use this fits the bill nicely.  All-in-all a great product within the chromebook lineup.","Cons. In comparing with c720, this is slower and have more errors. The cursor is so small to find in comparably bigger screen size. The outer body is so slippery that it's very hard to hold, and even when you are typing on your lap, you need to press it and hold it in someway so that it won't slip down. The 2 USB ports are all on same side and so close to each other that it's hard for put 2 USB with some bigger size\/SD card reader. The mouse pad is big and always accidentally hit while typing. Pros. It have better dimmer screen at night (C720 has very bright even at lowest screen light at night). Stronger body.","Great chrome book for the price, does everything I need it to do. I use it for school mostly and I just use word and PowerPoint online since it\u2019s not compatible to download. I have had some issues finding a wireless printer it works with. I usually save everything to google docs and print from my phone to get around that.","This was my first Chromebook and I am definitely not a fan. The laptop works great, turns on quickly, and feels well built however the problem for me is that its a Chromebook. If you want a machine to ONLY go in the internet with than this is for you. Even word processing can only be done on google docs. If you want a Chromebook, buy this. If you want a computer, dont, its no where near the same thing.","UPDATE: Sent it in for repair. Only lasted a week before the touch pad stopped working again. Sent back again and they received it Feb 9. It is now Feb 24 and status is still \"received\". I have now basically been without a computer since the beginning of January. Wish I could give negative stars!!!! Received it back from repair 2\/28 they received it 2\/9. Let's see how long it lasts this time. Only had this 4 months and the touchpad has stopped working. I've done a reset, powerwash, signed in a guest, nothing has helped. It will recognize a bluetooth mouse and that's what I'm down to using. It hasn't been dropped or handled roughly. Don't buy!!!!","I'm a college student who use laptop mainly for writing papers, conducting researches, and streaming videos. Because I carry this laptop everywhere in campus, weight is also an important factor for me. Overall, the quality is satisfying as long as I stick to my abovementioned purposes. It's premium design, full HD and wide 14inches(which are essential for video watching), and not too heavy to carry around. One problem that I found is its upper part feel very loose whenever I open this device. I'm afraid it would become even looser as time passes. Other than that, it is a great device for people like me.","Just received it, so far I am totally impressed with this device. I am a longtime windows user, hardcore mac lover and am quickly finding out that Chromebooks are great because it is always one, just as fast as my mac\/windows, virus free (for now), long battery life and super easy to use. Acer puts together a great package, it was boxed perfectly, the aluminum case feels sturdy and well made and the display is bright and vivid. The only con I can think of is the keyboard could have more of a tactile feel. However, this is a small one. For the future, waiting to see what android apps will look like and I wish the touchpad had more options i.e. wrist guarding when typing and pinch\/zoom control. Overall, well made and well implmented - for a quick economical performing machine for someone in my family who just uses the web, this rocks!","I ordered 2 of these at the end of August 2016, for my 2 kids in middle school. Both were outstanding machines and worked great. Fast, easy to use, relatively inexpensive (especially compared to traditional laptops), and long battery life. I would give 5 stars... It is now less than 7 months later and both stopped working properly. On one, the left side of the keyboard works intermittently and one vertical column of keys not at all, the other machine will not turn on. The screen stays black. Yes it's fully charged, and we checked the contrast. No noise, no screen, no nothing. This happened within 2-3 weeks of each other, I am mailing these back this week for repair (they're still under warranty) and we will see what is done. I will update this review after seeing how it is handled. UPDATE: Shipping was free for both, but I had to pay @$20 for the boxing\/packing at UPS. Received both machines back w\/in 2 weeks. 1 needed a new motherboard, the other they replaced the whole upper half of the case. Both are working great again. These are excellent machines for the price. Will keep the rating at 3 stars due to both having a problem in such a short time period from purchase.","Well it's been two weeks since I took order on this laptop and I couldn't be happier. The build quality for an under $300 laptop is incredible. I have always been a Windows guy but this time I decided to venture to a Chromebook. My kids use them in school (Dell)..so I decided to give it a try. It was a great choice so far..no heavy operating system in your way starting up and shutting down which I love. I'm so sick of updates with Windows! I had tried windows 10 on another machine that my mom owns and just thought that operating system is so redundant and layered IMHO. This is simple and gets the job done for me! The 14\" screen is the perfect size and Google docs - sheets - spreads work perfect. People have commented about the screen quality and key board but for me.... and given the PRICE POINT..it can't be beat IMHO. Remember folks this is not a Mac Air ($1,200 + or -)....and I'm not an Apple guy anyhow :) I would give it a go if your in the market at this price point and I think you will be VERY surprised with this Acer Chromebook! I purchased the 3 yr. extended warranty and we plan to look at this unit again when our daughter attends college in the fall. I'll give it 5* after more time with this machine.","I was given this Chromebook because my son fell in love with the other Chromebook I had from Toshiba. This Chromebook is useful for most of the things I currently do with a laptop. I also have a MacBook Pro and, honestly, nowadays I only use to access my Endnote library and statistical programs. For the rest, I only need to open my Chromebook. It starts up immediately, has anti-glare display and the battery lasts for at least full 8 hours. I have watched 3-4 movies in a row (during those lazy days) with a single charge. Simply love it. Gave another one to my daughter in Christmas. It has the advantages of the Chrome OS environment, including security, seamless updates, parental controls and full integration with the Google platform. This particular Chromebook has an excellent brushed-aluminum finish that makes it an elegant device. I simply love it. I am fully adapted to working with cloud-based systems now and Chromebooks fulfill almost all my computer needs.","I got this laptop for my girlfriend since hers broke right before uni started.  I decided to get her a chromebook because she doesn't do much with a computer other than do homework and watch videos. When she got it, she instantly loved it. The laptop itself looks stunningly beautiful and of premium quality for its price. However, two weeks after using it, the wi-fi stopped working. The laptop wouldn't connect to any network and I had to open it up to check what was wrong. I saw a video where they took the wi-fi card out and put it back again. I did that, but it still did not work. I spent hours upon hours trying to fix it for a week but to no avail. I came to the conclusion that the laptop is poorly designed in a way that the wi-fi card is loose and the cables which connect to it can easily be broken. It's shame since my girlfriend really likes the laptop. Thankfully, Amazon was kind enough to give me a full refund.","I am really enjoying this Chromebook.  If you need a way to spend time on the internet without all the security vulnerabilities of a full Windows box, this is the computer for you.  Just install the uBlock Origin extension from the Chrome Web Store and there is not much that will infect this device.  If you do get something creepy, the system can be wiped and put back to factory settings in 10 Min.  I like to do it once a month just for housekeeping. I am a power user on a windows box, so there is a bit of a learning curve to get used to this system to be a power user on this system, but it's coming together.  The screen on this system is beautiful, the battery life is incredible.  I hooked up a HDMI cable to our TV, and binge-watching netflix for 4 hrs, I still had plenty of battery life left. I was just involved with a cross country event, and spent several hrs at registration using the Chromebook to load GPS tracks into peoples Garmin devices and android phones and didn't even bring the power cord with me. The 14\" Screen is nice and big.  Alt + ] Snaps the window to the side of the screen to be able to view two different windows at once.  Alt + [ does the other side of the screen. Still working on a way to access file shares from my windows - Still a bit temperamental. Works great with HP printers that are attached to the network.  I don't know what the deal is with Canon and Brother.  They clearly need to get with the program.","One of the best Chromebooks available at the moment, incredible value for the low price. The battery life is excellent and it is super fast, light weight, real thin, stays cool...it doesn't even get warm after hours of use, great 14\" HD screen and a nice clean aluminum finish. Remember it is not a MacBook nor a Windows Laptop....a lot of people are comparing it to those devices, someone in another forum was even upset and gave it a not so good review because they could not install MS office and Photoshop...Chromebooks are not for those who doesn't understand what it is all about...please do some research before buying. We have a Mac desktop and a Windows 10 laptop in our household for the heavy lifting and a few cheap Chromebooks for all the fun stuff...shopping, streaming etc. If you are into Chromebooks then you can't go wrong with this beauty.","Bought this for my dad who's in his 70s. Wanted something that was user friendly and easy to fire and forget without a bunch of software and hardware upgrades to blow his mind with. This Chromebook met those needs. My father uses this almost daily to check email and get on the Internet when he needs to. The Google ecosystem was an easy transition for him since he has an Android phone. These Chromebooks are perfect for kids or the elderly who have simplistic needs.","This is just a really nice Chromebook. I've had mine for a year and a half and I still enjoy the look and feel of it. I get the same satisfaction out of opening it for which Mac users pay $2000 more. I'm used to Chrome OS which has pluses and minuses like every other operating system. Some folks below are slamming this chromebook for what they don't like about Chrome OS. Wait until they meet Windows. LOL! I like being able to access apps from the Android App store. Plus, I can and I do use Google Docs to do heavy duty document processing when needed. Seriously, at this price point, what is not to love? I would buy it again. I would even buy the same model again if they would add a backlit keyboard!","This is a perfect Chromebook. Great price and delivery. But there are no options to download Microsoft Office, just Office Online, which is not what I wanted as a writer. It's like a tablet in the shape of a laptop, which is cool, I kept it, but I should have really done my research. *POSITIVES: It's lightweight, gorgeous, fast, and being a heavy Google user, it's convenient and easy to use. There's no negatives from my end other than being unable to download Microsoft Word. BUT if you're not a heavy writer, using Google Docs can work just fine. 4.5 Stars! Seriously, we need Microsoft Word - it would have been 5 amazing stars if it had that.","This is my first full time Chromebook and I'm glad I spent a little more than I was initially planning.  This machine is very good for what it does, the price and spec ratio is perfect for light development using crouton (xfce linux).  In the ChromeOS I was able to quickly and easily swap the ctrl\/alt keys since I find the Mac keyboard layout is far superior (use your thumb and c\/v for copy\/paste). The only thing I've noticed (besides all the annoying details of a linux box) is the upper half of the bottom shell isn't completely flush on the edges.  It makes for a scratchy edge as the top overlaps the bottom.  I'm tempted to take a file to it. The machine is generally snappy and works well.  No fan does worry me a bit figuring that some websites (google hangouts) turn my Macbook into a hot toaster.  I'll see how that turns out soon enough.","I really did my \"homework\" before purchasing this Chromebook.  I am completely satisfied with this purchase.  It has the long lasting battery life as described. The keys leave a quiet and  unobtrusive footprint, keeping distractions to a minimum with general usage.  Especially great if you have another computer at home, this is not your end all be all of computers - but it is perfect for a chromebook - if you are a google - gmail, google docs etc. user than you will become comfortable quickly with the ease of use.  If you are not a google user - it is very easy to become a google fan.  Who doesn't \"Google\" something? It's that easy....... I love this laptop to put it quite simply.  BEST BANG for your BUCK!!!! By Far! I am very happy with this laptop purchase.","This is my first Chromebook. My Windows laptop had aged out and I wanted something sleek and light without spending a fortune. This Chromebook has a great look and feel, light enough and small enough to tuck under your arm on the go, but big enough to provide good readability and easy typing. The screen is super-sharp and has superior contrast (but I admit my point of comparison is a 10-year-old laptop).  I've only been using it for a few days, but so far I'm very happy. I received the Chrome OS update which supports Android apps, so now I can run Windows RDP and connect to my work and home computers for those increasingly rare times that I need access to a full desktop OS. Honestly, unless you really need a power-user platform, this Chromebook is almost a no-brainer. Strongly recommended.","This is the second Chromebook we have purchased and the third I have played with at home ( my sister got a Toshiba Chromebook 2). This computer is used primarily by my wife as a remote access computer to work on her office computer while physically at home. For this purpose it is hard to beat. The laptop has a premium build quality to it, it's all metal and has a good size keyboard. The screen is bright and much better than the C720 I've been using for web design for the past few years. I'm not sure it's as nice as the Toshiba screen though. If I could get this for $75 more with an i3 I would replace my C720. The only other negative is it doesn't use USB-C for the charger.","So I wanted a new laptop to replace my 11-year-old laptop that is so outdated it can't even load modern websites, and since I pretty much only use(d) my laptop for the web, I figured a Chromebook would be ideal.  It would also save me several hundred dollars relative to a Windows machine or Macbook. I was unsure whether I wanted this Chromebook or the 15\" model with upward-facing speakers, and ended up going with this one largely for aesthetic reasons: the aluminum case is not only lightweight and fanless, it also is attractive and could be confused for a Macbook.  The downward-facing speakers sound good, although as with all down-facing speakers how they sound depends what surface you put it on: on my kitchen counter, loud and clear; on my couch, still clear but much quieter.  This is mostly just fine.  The screen is bright and sharp, the keyboard has a comfortable feel to it, and although I have a wireless mouse, the multi-touch trackpad is effective enough that I don't need to use it.  I also get about 8-10 hours of battery life from my typical use of one tab of YouTube and a dozen tabs of social media, Wikipedia, and miscellaneous websites. The only negative things I have to say: the processor is a bit slow under some loads (although I am willing to put up with this for not having a fan), the power plug feels somewhat loose and fragile, and Chrome apps tend to be somewhat underwhelming compared to their rich client counterparts.  Overall it was worth it for me. 8) Update: After a month, the touchpad has started working only intermittently.  Sometimes it works like normal, sometimes it requires a bigger imprint than the tip of my finger provides, sometimes it does nothing (although a physical press for a left button click always works).  It seems to get worse when it's cold.  Although I'm sure Amazon would make it right if I returned\/replaced it, I'm lazier than that, and I'm mostly okay using a wireless mouse on my laptop.  Still, -1 star for build quality.","Fantastic little budget laptop.  My partner uses it daily and it's functioned very well for over 8 months now, still with great battery life too.  We were hoping to be able to use a USB DVD drive to watch movies, but alas there are no functional chrome plugins for that purpose; it's a limitation of the chrome OS. The most impressive part of these is the fantastic trackpad (usually hate them), and the high quality aluminum shell that rivals a MacBook Air in look and feel.  You can set it directly on a bed, couch or your lap with no overheating, and it's reasonably light weight.","I looked at reviews and ordered this Chromebook for my daughter to do her homework. The battery life is impressive. The fact that you don't really need anti-virus software is fantastic. The speed is impressive as well. We use this for surfing the web, google classroom applications, and other online apps. Other than the lack of a right-click button and the unique scrolling of google docs, this has been a great purchase. I will most likely by another one in a few years for my son. The Chromebook is very light weight. The keys are responsive. The keyboard is bit narrower than a normal computer (so it seems), but easy to get used to. So far we love this Chromebook!","I know the specs on this laptop are close to mediocre but let me just say that build quality is EXCELLENT. I bought this for my gf and compared it to my Acer Swift 3, they look and feel exactly alike. Battery life is awesome, screen looks perfect as well as viewing angles, speakers are a little low but nothing to get mad about. Trackpad is weird at first but it gets better over time and the keyboard has an excellent travel distance.","Great Chromebook. The chassis is looks super slick and well designed. I have people commenting on how great it looks all the time, and mistaking it for a Mac. Just using for light duty (websurfing, email, messaging etc) I have gotten 10 hours consistently. Heavy use (games etc) I get around 6. Has all the features you expect from a Chromebook (super fast boot, great battery life, lightweight, etc), and has a solid feel to it. The screen is great, but keep in mind many streaming video services do not support the Chrome OS, so they won't take advantage of the screen. With those that do the screen looks great. Speakers are fine, about middle of the road in my experience. Memory is good, but I wish it had just a little more processing power. But it's a Chromebook, so can't really fault it there. It does everything I expected it to do, well. I would recommend it.","This is a beautiful Chromebook. If you want to use it with ChromeOS then it's terrific. If you want to boot some other OS it has some serious downsides. It is not well supported although that is improving. I bought this intending to boot Linux on it and use it as a portable workstation for coding. However booting off the eMMC is not yet supported by the available ROM images out there. I am currently working on this issue. Also you must use a Linux kernel that is compiled with the config parameter CONFIG_PINCTRL_CHERRYVIEW=y if you want the internal keyboard to work. Most distros are now using kernels with this parameter though so it is not as much of an issue as when I bought it. I'm looking forward to it being a functional computer.","Bought as a gift for a friend who admired by ChromeBook 14 that I had bought earlier for myself.  Unfortunately, she was unable to purchase one during Amazon Prime Days, so I bought her one as a gift.  So far, she loves the Chromebook's ease of use and long battery life!  I only bought it for myself when I travel and love the larger screen versus trying to use my phone to search, plus its a lot lighter than my 17.3\" notebook that I usually carry.  Overall, I would recommend it to any user looking for a light and sleek, user friendly laptop with a great battery life.","I really enjoyed this product for a while, I do a lot of my work on Google Drive and I was impressed by the speed of the processes and booting-up of this Chromebook. However, after about 5 months it suddenly stopped detecting any WiFi sources, which is strange because this laptop has been so gently handled. From what I\u2019ve found troubleshooting this issue, it would appear that other people with this problem have had defective WiFi chips, and I\u2019m unfortunately finding this out after my product service has expired. I figured to work around this I would just try using a USB WiFi adapter, only to find that none of the adapters that I have are compatible (and I don\u2019t want to waste any more money on other ones to find that they don\u2019t work either). Next I tried a factory reset, still didn\u2019t help (lost a couple files but luckily didn\u2019t have much saved to the chromebook itself). Needless to say, pretty disappointed to have spent the money on this product to find that the one thing that I need to work on it (internet) suddenly stopped due to a defective part.","I think this is my 4th Chromebook, I also have an ASUS C100P. Chrome is Chrome, you either like it or you do not, fine for most what I do, I have a Windows Desktop as well. Sort of similar to the ASUS, but a lot bigger. sort of surprised how big it was, has a very nice screen and good construction, Comments about the charger, well I thought it was fine, not that big. It really depends on what you like and whether the bigger screen is a must, I can see myself switching between both, certainly the Acer is nicer for watching Netflix etc  or if I have a lot of information on the screen. And the sound is much better than the Asus.","It performs well and looks and feels like an expensive laptop. The screen size is just right for all the browsing and things I do. The touchpad is very sensitive, which makes it easy to navigate web page. Why only 4 Stars: I would give this 5 stars, if typing was a better experience. When typing, I have to hover my palms, instead of allowing them to rest a little, somewhere to stabalize the typing. If I am not careful, a palm, without actually touching the trackpad, will cause the cursor to skip to a new location and sometimes click on a link. I do not have that problem on my 15.5 inch Acer Chromebook, which is what I am using now to type this review.","I have had my ACER Chromebook for about 6 months now, and I am on my 4th power adapter, with a new spare in the drawer ready when needed.  It is a cheap little 90 degree angle pin that breaks off at the slightest nudge.  Usually the pin breaks off inside and you need to pry it out.  As soon as it breaks (again), I plug in my spare and immediately order a new spare (approx $14).  Fortunately, the Acer has very good battery life if you get stuck without one.  This computer boots up almost immediately, much faster than my old windows Acer.  But you better get used to your windows friends not being able to open your documents or photos, as Chrome expects everyone else to load Chrome.  And Chrome seems to track your every move on the web, whether you use Google or not.  Even if you use DuckDuckGo to search zebras, you'll still get ads popping up for zebra supplies when you open a news or weather site.  I have also not been able to make this system stream to my RCA flatscreen TV.  Articles recommend purchasing different HDMI cords\/devices, but no guarantees it will fix the problem.  Overall, I would probably not recommend this computer to friends.","This is a very nice Chromebook.  As many have said it looks great.  It has a nice screen, which while not the brightest, is adequate for most uses.  The keyboard is good and is easy to type on, at least for me.  While the track pad is functional if not flashy.  The performance is reasonably quick for most things, and it plays videos, YouTube and Netflix without problem.  The speakers are also quite good.  The build quality, while generally good, does in my case have one minor flaw.  The metal bezel around the monitor keeps lifting up.  I have already returned my machine once to have this repaired, and now within a week of its return, the bezel is again lifting up in a corner.  I don't know if others are having this issue, and while it does not effect the functionality of the device, its is very annoying.  The one thing that definitely makes this an outstanding machine is that it has Chrome OS on it, and not that god awful Windows 10.  This means its stable, reliable, and not affected by the multitude of Windows problems, including all the update failures and screw ups Win 10 is now so famous for.  So if your looking for a decent Chromebook \/ notebook for general computing uses, this machine is a very good option.","So I have agonized over a chromebook for a while now. And finally got this one! It's perfect for me. Just mainly surfing the ner, watching movies, on social media and making list and printing them out. I'm a working mom with teenagers so I wanted my own computer. This chromebook is perfect for me! Screen resolution is great, sound is great and getting online is a breeze. A true winner for me. The battery has a very long charge time also..mine lasted 12 hours. I wasn't on it the whole time but in spurts, but that is fine with me!","This is the second  Acer Chromebook 14 I have owned. I returned the first one as it failed to boot up after a week of use.  The replacement worked fine for a while but I ran into a different problem -- the charger port loosened from its mount which made it impossible to charge and therefore useless. I eventually opened up the case, saw the problem and was able to tape the charger port in place which allowed me to charge the machine. After sever months of use, I was unable to plug the charger into the charger port but this time it was due to what sppeared to be a defective pin inside the port. Its a shame because I like the machine but unfortunately the build quality is extremely poor.  Three strikes and you're out Acer.","Needed a Chromebook just for working and I think this one is a great purchase. The Acer Chromebook 14 comes with a 1080p display which is very neat. The laptop itself feels premium because it is made of aluminum. A friend felt the Chromebook exterior and told me that it feels just like a Macbook. This Chromebook has a very fast booting time and the keyboard is also very easy to type on. The one issue I have would be the speakers being placed on the bottom left and right of the laptop. This muffles the sound a bit, but it's bearable. Other than that, great work laptop. It's fast and can load multiple tabs at ease.","So I've been using my MacBook Air for a good five years now. And since Google and Java won't update any further, I thought it was time for a change. I was a little apprehensive about buying a Chromebook at first since there's so many different ones to choose from. But after reading a few different reviews and shopping around for the best price, I finally decided on the Acer Chromebook. It has a nice design and isn't too heavy. This laptop is really great if you're looking to do simple tasks like surfing the web, doing homework, and writing reports. It's perfect for both my work and school life (as well as using it just to play around), and I'm really happy with my purchase. My only complaint is that there's a few things on the Chromebook that you can't get. For instance, I used iTunes all the time on my MacBook; unfortunately, you can only use Google Play. I know that I'll eventually learn to like it, but I'm still a little disappointed. Due keep in mind, though, that I'm still just learning the basics of this laptop, Other than that, the laptop is great! It's fast, it has a nice HD screen for movies and YouTube videos, it has a virus protection built in (a strong selling point for me), and it's gold color is unique and gorgeous.","After a year, it's still doing a great job. As Christmas gift to my wife, it more than filled the bill. She keeps it chair-side in the living room and prefers it to her desktop computer because it's much faster - nearly instant on. Works well with wireless mouse; WiFi is fast. Solid state components make it fast. Chromebooks make things easier in many ways because of the integrated approach of Google - her email is available on her Chromebook as well as an Android phone. Downsides: won't work with our USB-connected printer - wireless printer required. No \"delete\" key so one is required to do a non-intuitive backspace to dump a selection to the trash.","Does everything I want for casual laptop use and probably does everything people who own $1000 MacBooks need. The metal body gives it an enormously rigid feel. The battery life is incredible. The screen is a great size. The resolution is as much as one would need. Make sure you are educated about how Chrome OS works. If you do you will be much happier. Google throws away most conventions of traditional operating systems. For instance, I connected my printer directly to Google Cloud Print and now I can easily print from my Chromebook. I can even print when I'm not on my home network. My biggest complaint is probably the color in the screen. When I have it next to my 2015 MacBook Pro there is an obvious \"warm\" color to the Acer screen and the resolution is just 1080 when the MacBook is more. That being said, it's really not fair to compare these two considering the Acer is literally 1\/10 of the cost. Don't let my comment scare you. The screen is great. Just don't expect it to be for photo editing etc.","After owning it for a little over a year, the screen on it has begun to fail. It randomly goes dark or washes out and the mouse freezes. It has never even been dropped or traveled with, so I am disappointed in the quality.","at first i didn't know what to expect from a pared-down laptop\/overblown tablet, but for the money this is an amazing thin client. i like the metal case, even being thin aluminum (and probably less resistant to impacts\/damage), it doesn't _feel_ as cheap when handling it. it's snappy and responsive to input. it's mostly equipped to browse the web, edit documents and play media; it does all of this (and more) quite capably. the 1080p screen is beautiful, and it looks great watching movies and youtube. The chrome environment is starting to get more useable apps everyday. i don't miss most of what they left out, as it makes for a lighter and thinner device. the keyboard is not backlit, but that's on me for not knowing how to type. as a chromebook, expect to only get the most of it while connected to a network. there is only about 20GB of useable storage, but that's plenty to store quite a few documents and spreadsheets. it's a great little device if you are willing to live in a googlecentric environment. they've certainly made it easy. it's what i need without a ton of junk i don't.","Great picture, runs fast and I am very happy with this purchase. The battery life is not as good as my last chromebook but it was smaller and not as high quality screen, but I do get a good 8-10 hours without having to charge and that is while running multiple CRM programs or regular streaming. If you need a good computer at a great price point this one works well. One other note is that I thought it might be too heavy and big for my brifcase but it is actually just slightly heavier than my old (11inch) chromebook and fits perfect in a small briefcase.","Good value.  Might regret not having touchscreen later but it was a choice I knew I was making.  Fast performance, great viewing.  I purchased this primarily for remoting in to my office computer when I am on the road.  Using Splashtop professional I find this is perfectly good for this purpose.  You may want to add a mouse to one of the 2 usb ports, we find that more convenient.  This now has access to the Android aps, some that I have tried do not work.  I have watched Netflix on it and found the volume a bit weak, but I solved that by using my bluetooth headset.","Couldn't pass up the black friday deal.  Have one older small chromebook and they have come a long way.  Nice keyboard, good resolution, great for surfing web, financials and emails - I don't do games so can't address how it works for that.  Chromebooks take some getting used to, but that said I can switch between windows desktop and the chromebook pretty easily.  Each has their own good points. This one is well made - I have only one complaint.  The charger plug in point on the side of the chromebook is sloppy.  As others have said, its the one weak spot.  I ordered a spare charger as this one sticks out of the side with a very thin connector and I want to be prepared. But so far so good.  No issues with the software or hardware.  It was a great deal.","Acer makes a nice Chromebook.  The hardware is nice and is of high quality which is why this has 3 stars.  The rest of the gripe is about Chromebook and not Acer.  Chromebooks are great if ALL of your work is on the Internet and you use a lot of Google services.  As soon as you have a local LAN at home or a NAS for storing data, the Chromebook performs poorly.  Accessing a local share on a NAS is unreliable and causes unstable peformance and lock ups.  Seems to be meant for Internet use.  We still use it and deal with the workarounds by usng another laptop with windows os as it has no problem with network shares, etc.  Had high hopes, maybe pass it along to our kids...","Purchased 11\/27\/2017. Connected to 21\" monitor via HDMI cable. Monitor screen turns green occasionally requiring me to unplug HDMI cable or reboot to fix problem. I have a second chrome book (Toshiba) which never demonstrates this problem even with same monitor, cable etc. Will contact Tech support tomorrow. UPDATE 3 11  2018  Called Tech Support several days ago AND got through pretty quick!!! The tech talked me through a procedure and I haven't  had the issue since!!! As long as it stays \"fixed\" I'm a happy customer.","This is my first Chromebook. I couldn't afford to buy a new laptop so I thought I wod try this... I have been using about 8 months and it's pretty good with most things but will crash and freeze sometimes. I was debating whether I could use this as my laptop from now on or would need to save for a new real laptop... I am saving as I dont think this machine will have the longevity I am looking for.","I don't need windows, and I find chromebook to be easy and fun to use. The only down side is that they don't push updates after the computer is 4 years old or so.  The first thing I did when I received this one was look at the date of manufacture. I bought this in November 2018 and it was manufactured in June of 2017, so it was sitting on the shelf for over a year, hence I lost a year of useful computer life  : (","I needed a new laptop to take care of personal things like emails, banking, amazon orders etc. I did a lot of research and often felt overwhelmed with all the options between laptops and Chromebooks. I really didn't have a big budget for the new computer either. This Acer 14 Chromebook is perfect for what I needed. It turns on quickly unlike my much older Acer Laptop which took SOOOO long to start and load. The set up was a flash, and got connected to the internet quickly. I also have an Android phone so the switch to this Chromebook was very easy and everything synced through Google and Gmail.","I am very happy with my new Chromebook. The screen size is very nice and it has an aluminum casing. It performs really well and I use it for just about everything. It occasionally forgets to start upon opening - something that my old one did as well. And it flickers every once in a while, but I've read that is a problem with the OS and I'm not motivated to take the steps to change it. I'm very happy with the Chromebook OS - I get the Google Office and Google Drive cloud storage. It takes a little while to get used to something that's not Windows but I'm really happy I did! My next laptop will also be a Chromebook. This would also be an excellent option for students on a budget!","I've had the Acer Chromebook 14 now for about 4 months.  Not one problem.  From the other reviews, I knew some of the shortcuts for chromebook & I looked up others.  Ie, I made the escape key my delete key....I also opened a new gmail acct when I started it up for the first time.  It couldn't be easier or work smoother, plus the battery lasts forever.  I really love it.","Great computer, great price, quick shipment. After several days, I have only one complaint.  Wish it had an sd card slot. I got a usb 3.0 sd adapter to use with it. Gives me the ability to transfer and view photos, videos, and add aps. I especially liked the 5gh wifi band. My download speed is almost 300 mb\/sec. This makes a great addition to my old desktop computer which may croak at any time. Highly recommended.","Great build quality and excellent screen for a chrome book. Almost no heat emission and extended battery life is much appreciated, this make for a perfect travel computer. Web browsing is actually better than on a Windows OS computer. My biggest disappointment is the lack of a SD card slot for extending the storage capacity, sure you can use a micro USB drive but the protrudes from the computer and occupies  a port. Why so cheap Acer? Minor concern is the power adapter, plug is very small and the contact area with the computer is also small which leads to questionable durability. Time will tell, but for now the performance is great.","Bought this for my husband to replace his desktop PC because I'll be working from home and needing to use the office for work.  He is loving it.  The two of us sit in bed and use our respective laptops every night - our kids think we're silly.  It's just fun.  Working great although there was definitely a learning curve for the chromebook vs an old PC experience.","Excellent Chromebook from Acer.  I've owned quite a few Chromebooks over the years but, really, none of them come close to this one. The craftsmanship of this product is evident in the build quality: aluminum construction with rounded edges and a tapered body.  Very nice.  Definitely a first for a Chromebook. The screen is very nice with good viewing angles and the anti-reflective coating is nice as well. The keyboard is superb in my opinion and is extremely easy to type on.  The track pad, conversely, is average. The speakers are pretty nice as well but why they are down-facing is an enigma. The 4GB RAM is adequate for all but the most labor-intensive tasks and the 32GB of on-board storage is also adequate. All in all a very nice machine and a pleasure to use.","Love the metal casing and look. More importantly I appreciate the uncanny speed to boot up or wake up...and no more interruptions for updating Windows and such. Battery life is best I have ever seen. Use it all day. Charge it at night. Never has it run out of power while on battery. Security from virus and malware problems is very comforting. Being able to \"powerwash\" back to factory standards without losing any of my bookmarks and settings is a big plus. Adding a USB thumb drive to save files locally is a super convenience. For word processing I much prefer using MS WORD to Google Docs....but that was not a deal killer for me. There is a slight learning curve to learning how to print from a Chromebook. There are a lot of good tutorials on the subject to be found by Google Search and YouTube. I now own Two Acer Chromebooks: a 14 and a 15 and at least 4 of my friends I have shown them to have purchased one for themselves.","[Update July 2018: I've been using this Chromebook for about a year now and love it as much as when I first got it. The aluminum frame has proved to be exceptionally rugged, the screen hinges feel brand new, and the keyboard and trackpad are still operating at peak. This Chromebook has been used heavily, stuffed in backpacks, carried around the home and campus, and still looks and works like new.] Beautiful laptop. I've been using Chromebooks for years as my primary systems. This Acer Chromebook 14 is noticeably higher quality than most Chromebooks, with a beautiful aluminum shell, a great screen, and a nice integrated trackpad. It has a much classier feel than most Chromebooks, and the price is a relatively small premium over its all-plastic brethren. The shaping\/sculpting of the chassis is very Mac-like; it looks good and slips easily into a backpack. I've been using this system for about a month, and it's a joy to use. My other current favorite Chromebook is also an Acer, the Acer 15.6\" HD model. The extra inch and a half of screen is really nice, but it's also quite a bit bulkier and heavier, so it's best as a computer that lives on a desk most of the time. Both of my HP 14 Chromebooks died in just over a year (just after the warranties expired). One one the fan is shot; on the other (which is fanless), the keyboard died. I'm fed up with the poor build quality of HP Chromebooks and have been much happier with the quality of the Acer models.","I bought this because I needed a laptop for a graduate program and I refused to pay \"real\" money. I have long fingers and wide hands, and I find that working on a laptop can be infuriating. I spend a good deal of time muttering under my breath because the cursor jumps all over the place and I accidentally close programs with an errant pinky. I still had some of those kinds of mishaps with the Chromebook -- but not nearly as many. My place of work uses Google for everything, so not having MSWord wasn't such a big deal. Plus, Google Docs has a way of saving things so that they're compatible with MSWord. The machine is great for streaming videos -- my wife and I use it regularly to watch things on Amazon Prime -- and the battery last quite a while. The usual caveats apply: You need to have a Google account to set-up the Chromebook and you must have Internet access to use it."],"30":["I am a freelance designer. I needed a small durable laptop that can handle lots of artboards, heavy psds, animation, video editing etc.. but i really wanted to stay away from a 15\" laptop.  I was not sure about this one and assumed i was taking a gamble. For one i dont like HP, the customer service is awful and i think they cheap out alot. With all this said i have been very happy so far. after effects, spotify, chrome, couple adobe psds, few affinity files etc. thing works great i haven't noticed any real issues so far. as far as power its been pretty solid. The keyboard is fantastic, one of the best i have used on a laptop. Screen is fantastic, sharp clear good colors. build quality is fantastic, VERY VERY solid machine. the battery is incredible. lasts a VERY VERY long time. much longer than 4 hours. Cons: My biggest pet peeve with laptop companies is the fact that they ALWAYS F-up the thermal paste so the thing is bouncing off 98c. This laptop was a bit different after a day of lots of creation, 2 cores hit around 89-90 but stayed around 65-75 degrees. For an ultra book thats not bad. Since im a heat nut, i  re-thermal pasted the cpu and bought it down 10 degrees. So after a long day of creating, i maxed out at 78-80 with average of 50-65. Currently im pretty happy with the machine.","Terrible Terrible... This is not a brand new product. The box was already open and it looks like someone used it. It was totally unsealed when I got that. I have to return it.","I bought this notebook because I was looking for something powerful but small and thin. This Ultrabook fulfills those characteristics. I can edit videos in Adobe Premiere, even in RED RAW format. The port on the left is really fast, but the one on the right works like USB 2.0 in speed. The biggest problem is the duration of the battery. It does not matter how you configure it, nor the saving mode, nor any setting that you can apply. The duration does not drop from 4: 20hs. I was able to update manually to Windows 10 May Update but it still did not improve. I hope you can improve some configuration, since in the minimum use of it, or in Idle mode, there is no possibility to reduce the Discharge Rate.","This is probably my 10th laptop... this one feels fast, touch screen, mouse pad, speakers, and keyboard are all great.  have only had it a few hours, but so far its just what we wanted and ordered.  The display is truly beautiful.  Cannot get a feel for battery yet, of course, but its held its charge for a couple of hours already.  Took some time to remove the bloat -- but set up was otherwise painless.  Added a tiny app to control fan -- otherwise, the fan runs loud and often.  Was surprised it had a fan with the SSD drive -- but HP should include an app to control the fan.  (My 10\" Dells never had a fan, but my two HPs have both had loud fans.) We actually ordered this from HP directly because this listing said dual processor instead of quad -- but that is a typo.  Ordering this on the phone through HP ended up in them sending the wrong laptop for $50 more...  and it took about 10 days to get it... and that was during their Memorial Day sale.  Shipped it back and ordered this one.  The extended warranty package was only for three years from HP and was more expensive then the 4 year package offered through Amazon... those things are usually not worth it, but for 10-15% of the price of a laptop heading off to college, I thought it might be worth it this time. (Included free shipping to get your laptop fixed... if it can't be fixed, they give you an Amazon gift card for the cost of the laptop... only reviews on the insurance have been poor. but there was sooo few of them... and the reviews just didn't seem right, so decided to give it a shot.)","shipped all the way to Saudi Arabia, came in new unopened. A very speced out especially the mx250 video card and the ddr4 rams, you will never find such specs with this price. Highly recommend it. a little coil one, not to loud, comes and goes depends on heavy usage. The only thing i dont like about this laptop that the screen can't be laid back much, it only opens to certain degree which is not enough for my use. Other than that i would give it 5 stars! haven't tried it on video editing yet since that is the reason i bought the laptop for, I will update my review on that after testing it. Oh and i am sad they removed the fancy looking wooden line at the back of the screen like the previous models.","Update:  I want to love this computer but for the price it is not worth it.  Once you have several browser windows up it slows to a crawl and sometimes just freezes.  Any kind of multitasking does not work.  Very frustrated especially for the price point I just got this computer and I have loved everything about it.  It is sleek, light and looks great.  It is very fast and has a beautiful display.  I have already streamed several movies and shows on it.  However, after having it for about a week the fingerprint sensor does not activate leaving me to use my password to log on.  Not sure what happened or what I need to do to make it work.  Otherwise everything is great.","It was good if it\u2019s a general use laptop. The touchscreen every so often wouldn\u2019t respond. And often the fingerprint scanner didn\u2019t read until after a few attempts. The screen was very good though crystal image and it would run programs well, although it did have it moments of non responsive actions.","Excellent","This laptop's specs and price were such a great balance. On paper this is a great product, but HP clearly isn't doing proper quality control on this model (after using 4 HP laptops over the years, actually, I'm done with HP). I am taking time to review this item simply to help out other people, and my sincere advice to you is turn away. There are so many good laptops in the 1000+ range and with a bit more money you can get something for which you're not taking a chance. I did and it didn't work out. Be smart. Don't be like me. Issues - - So much HP crapware. Oh well, I cleaned that up on day 1. - On the first day I noticed the touchpad has \"give\" on the front edge (towards the user) and it actually rises slightly above the surface, enough to scrape on skin. Anyway, I thought, lets ignore this and move on. - In a few weeks, I noticed a dead pixel on the screen. Now I can't help but notice it all the time. Perfect. - The fingerprint sensor works 50% of the time. Wiping finger and sensor doesn't help when it doesn't work. - [maybe not a laptop issue] I use a bluetooth mouse and sometimes the mouse pointer just goes crazy and wants to go to the lower right corner. If all these things worked like on paper, this would be a laptop I would be recommending to *everyone* but as they say, in business, execution is key. Or they're giving a price cut by using cut-rate parts, like the display - which is gorgeous, except with a dead pixel. Who knows. All you need to know is you're tossing a coin on this one. In hindsight, I should have seen that coming given the high number of 5s and 1s in the reviews, but as I said, be smart, don't be like me.","Bought on Prime day so I got a good value. I was looking for something reliable, powerful, and portable. This laptop fit my needs. Pros: -Beautiful display -Small, compact, and portable -Fast and powerful specs -Touchscreen works well -Nice keyboard, and it's backlit -Fingerprint makes for fast sign on -Runs Adobe applications like premiere pro and photoshop no problem. -Fast Charging -I haven't had issues with heat yet. All seems normal for a laptop. Cons: -Track pad is small, feels cheap, and it's touch is not comfortable to use. They could have moved the keyboard up and put a larger trackpad. Im using a mouse instead. -Only 1 USB C port. I would rather they get rid of the proprietary charging port and do USB-C charging. The power supply is smaller than most, but I'd rather have a second usable port with the option to charge and not carry the power adapter. -USB-C port is not thunderbolt 3. I feel that's a missed potential. -No full size SD card slot....seriously why not? Many of us camera people use full size SD cards. The micro SD slot  is mainly good for expanding the laptop memory. Overall, it's a nice machine. I'd recommend it.","Ive had this laptop for a full month now and up until today 8-20-19 I was happy. Only major issue I had was with the mouse touchpad being too sensitive or not sensitive enough. Today I turned the laptop on, it stayed on for 5 minutes before going into sleep mode (at least that\u2019s what I though). When I tried to restart  it I realized it shutoff and I couldn\u2019t turn it back on. The battery was fully charged and I tried various techniques to get it back up and running; none of which worked. After doing a google search it appears this is a normal malfunction of the laptop. HP support shows a case from 2017 with the same problem. I contacted Amazon and was forwarded to HP. The tech walk me through numerous steps to get it restarted and nothing worked. She later mentioned it was my internal battery and it\u2019s probably dead. Now I\u2019m waiting to received a box and shipping label to return the laptop back to HP for repair or replacement.","I bought this for my son as a graduation present to take to college.  He got it on May 25th and it is now August 8th.  It has been dead since July 15th and back at HP.  We got it back today after swapping out power bricks and then a total motherboard replacement and it came back DOA.  At this point it has been broken longer than it has worked.  Of course since we tried to go through the warranty process, now we are past the return window.  Now what?  I would not recommend!","Pros *Fast: The specs on this Laptop are very high end keeping it very fast *The screen is so crisp and the viewing angles are so good the touchscreen is very responsive but i dont use it much due to fingerprints *The keyboard feels very good to use and the back-lighting is a nice touch *The dedicated GPU is very basic but can handle most things you throw at it (Except intense gaming it can handle anything before 2013) *The Aluminum build feels so quality and there is no flex in the build *The speakers are the best Laptop speakers i have ever had whenever i am using it i have spotify on and it sounds good *the amount of ports on it is perfect nothing that i dont need *I bough this to use all through collage and how small and light it is is very good *Battery life is good if you dont push it too hard (easily last a day) Cons *The fingerprint sensor after one month seldom works  *The touch-pad is not that precise but i dont care i use a Bluetooth mouse (and i recommend it) *The front camera is a embarrassment for a $1200 laptop (But the switch is nice) For anyone looking for a quality powerful durable sturdy laptop I would recommend fully","For a higher end laptop costing more then $1,000 this laptop does not deliver. The arrow of the mouse frequently vanishes from the screen and you have no choice but to wait for it to return out of nowhere.  The biggest problem however is video playback.  Initially, no videos would play. I had not tried to play any videos the first several days so am unaware if it ever worked.  The advice given was to reset Windows which would delete all apps installed.  After doing this, the volume came back.  Now, the videos play but there is no volume and nothing is muted.  This computer has a lot of very frustrating glitches.  It is a bit faster then some of the lower end laptops but again is not reliable.  My suggestion would be to look at at computers with a similar processor speed .  I also bought an HP Touchscreen desktop and it has it's own set of problems related to basic function. update:  The sound card is not working after one month.  Microsoft can't detect the issue.  Video plays half the time.  One expensive piece of crap.  Spend money for a good computer and can't even watch You Tube or Skype.  Repair warranty - 10 days without computer to try to fix and have to back up all files.","Let me preface this by stating that I am a Mac user - I don't have the most expensive models - I have bought used and scoured for discounts over the years - but only this year I replaced my 2011 21.5\" iMac for a Late 2015 Retina 27\" iMac I bought used. My 2011 was still going strong, but I wanted a bigger screen. If it had been a PC - an 8-year old PC - it would have been replaced years ago. My daughter started her first year at college and wanted a laptop and is not a Mac person (she uses an iPad and an iPhone though) So I tried to find the best value in a small PC. Needless to say I was disappointed when the computer arrived and there was no response for the touchscreen. I scoured the internet for a simple fix and the ones I found involved deleting drivers and messing with the bios - things I have never messed with on my Macs. So I called HP, gave them my serial number and was told it would need to come in for repair. As I received it the day before, I returned it. Thank heaven for Amazon. I have ordered another HP computer, this time a Spectre x360, hoping that since it was a 2in1, they wouldn't forget to assemble it with a touchscreen. Most importantly, I bought a 4-year warranty with accident protection. The Envy computer looked great, but out of the box defective makes one leery.","I had been on the fence for months with my next ultrabook purchase, leaning toward the Surface Laptop 2, considering the stalwart Dell equivalent (XPS) and somehow landing on the Envy. I pored over reviews, technical data, and other analysis but decided on the HP because it was just too much premium and value to disqualify. This particular version is packed with tech that would cost over $2,000 in a similarly equipped Surface Laptop 2, yet I paid just $1000 on Prime Day. Even at $1299 it's a steal, considering you're getting a full 4k display, 512gb SSD and 16gb RAM. The fingerprint reader and backlit keyboard are bonuses, as is the premium build of the hardware. It may not quite edge out the Microsoft fit and finish but it's awfully close. I came from a Yoga 910 which was a gorgeous laptop with similar specs, but I couldn't stand the keyboard. It was prone to missing my keystrokes, and it was loud, with shallow key travel. The Envy's keyboard proved a far better suitor after testing it out at a retail box store, and the rest is history. If you are a writer, appreciate fine design, and want a speedy 8th Gen i7 with more storage and RAM than the average user would ever need, here's your ultrabook. Forget the frills of Bang & Olufsen, which is really just a nicely placed license to evoke an extra premium feel rather than a useful sound upgrade, and enjoy the quality build. Don't expect the fingerprint reader to be 100% accurate (it's not), but appreciate the fact that HP put the front-facing webcam where it's supposed to be and deal with the above-average battery life that underdelivers but still excels. Oh yeah, and grab the two-year accidental damage protection plan which is just $50 through Amazon, rather than paying $200 or more through a retail channel.","The features \/ specs are amazing.  The price is fantastic.  But fatal flaws made me return this unit. Screen - Fantastic colors and brightness.  Of course it's hard to appreciate 4K vs 1080p on a 13.3\" screen, but side-by-side it is definitely noticeable (against other PCs). Power - Quad-core i7 and 16gb of DDR4 ram.  Need I say more?  As fast as a 13\" laptop can be right now.  Only video editing would you notice any real lagging. Sound - I think the B&O speakers are miles ahead of most other laptop speakers, especially 13\" ones.  A+++ here. Quality - Excellent.  A solid device without a doubt - competing with Apple quality. Keyboard - Huge problem here.  The added row of keys on the right side shifts the entire keyboard to the left.  I don't know why other reviews don't harp on this.  It not ergonomic at all, and all your years of muscle memory with a QWERTY keyboard will be wasted.  I used it for a week, did several typing tests, and consistently had problems with this layout.  I wish it was centered like every other computer.  On a small laptop, it is very awkward to place your hands on the left side of the computer. Touchpad - Another huge problem here.  I was coming from a Macbook, which uses a glass touchpad.  This touchpad has a lot of texture, so it is very difficult to make smooth movements on it.  In fact, this ended up being the most annoying problem and the one I could've live with.  Perhaps if you are coming from another PC with a rough touchpad you wouldn't notice. In the end, the specs of this laptop are amazing.  The build quality is phenomenal.  The laptop is beautiful.  But it just wasn't usable for me.  I realize the keyboard and touchpad issues seem small - but these are the most frequently used parts of a computer.  Even being a little off makes the whole computer... off.  I ended up getting an i5 XPS 13\" and I am very happy with it - the aforementioned issues don't exist with that computer.","I bought this machine for my next two years of college, as my old Macbook died. Out of all the things I like about this computer, the thing I like the most is the keyboard. It is very tactile, the keys have just the right amount of travel and are very responsive. If your looking for a laptop that you will be typing a lot on, this is the one to get. For performance, the i7 CPU in this handles everything I throw at it comfortably, and with 16gb of RAM and a dedicated graphics chip, things run very smoothly. I even threw some light photo editing in Lightroom and playing some older games and this did it without issue. The 4k screen is nice, but I'd say that the actual display quality is average. Though the resolution is good, the colors are definitely average and so is the contrast (at least when comparing to my old Retina Macbook). I'm sure to the average user this wouldn't be noticeable. As for the touchscreen, I don't really care for touchscreen computers so I will probably never use that feature. The fingerprint reader is a nice feature, it saves me from having to type in my password on the lockscreen. For battery, I probably get like 3-4 hours of normal usage on the \"better battery\" power mode. \"power saving\" mode is far to slow to make it usable, especially if you are multitasking.","Very good design.  Cool!,  it runs really cool, much cooler than some competitors for its good air circulation mechanism offered by the screen lid.  The bottom of laptop will be raised a little bit when you open it,  which also makes it more comfortable to use keypad. The touch screen sometimes needs to be re-enabled from device manager when it is not responsive,  hope HP will issue update to correct this issue.  Other than that,  perfect machine with mainstream configuration ~$1000!","The keyboard stopped functioning after 45 days I bought this laptop and spent 2 hours with HP customer service representative just to realize that this has mechanical failure and have to send it for repair. Very disapponted.","tenia 8 a\u00f1os de no usar windows , unicamnete tenia dispositos Mac, y quise darme un respiro de apple comprando esta computadora, despues de unos dias de uso, me parece una computadora muy buena, muy rapida, ensciende en menos de 10 segundos y con puntos que resaltan como los siguientes : -El teclado es muy comodo para escribir -El touch de la pantalla no lo uso con frecuencia, pero supongo que habra momentos que pueda ser util, pero funciona muy bien. -Lo peque\u00f1a y ligera que es la computadora es excelente , muy practica para llevar de un lugar a otro. -La pantalla con los bordes tan delgados me encanta. -El sonido me sorprendio mucho, no es para hacer una fiesta pero si es un sonido muy bueno comparado con las mayorias de computadoras portatiles,  hablo por la calidad del sonido mas que por el volumen. -La calidad de la pantalla es muy buena, sin lugar a duda uno de los puntos mas fuertes. Las cosas que quiza podrian mejorar: -El trackpad es un poco peque\u00f1o de alto, un poco incomodo a veces, pero si usas mouse no tendras problemas. -Para que fuera perfecta seria genial tener una memmoria de video de 4 gigas , ya que la de 2 gigas se queda corta con muchos juegos aunque hay algunos que corren de manera descente ( Se que no esta dise\u00f1ada para jugar, pero nunca esta de mas saber que lo puedes hacer) -Tiene los puertos necesarios, aunque un puerto hdmi nunca esta de mas, aunque se que no lo pusieron para mantener la delgadez del aparato . En conclusion de momento me esta encantando, solo espero que windows sea tan estable como el sistema operativo de apple, pero eso ya no es problema del aparato. Seguro recomiendo la compra de esta computadora","I was very excited to receive this laptop to replace my older Dell Latitude 7280. Once I received it, I reformatted the drive and did a clean install of Windows 10 Pro. I re-installed drivers from HPs support site and I then started to transfer all my data from my old system to this new one. Once everything was setup, I unplugged the laptop and to my surprise the system estimates only 4 hours and 15 minutes of battery life from a full charge (Display dimmed 50%, battery saver mode on). I have outlook open and 1 Edge browser tab open which I am using to write this review. This estimation is WELL below what is advertised. My system is fully updated with the latest available drivers and Windows updates. This is a massive disappointment; my Dell which is 3 years old can last at least 7 hours on a full charge running almost the same specs and apps. I will attempt to find a resolution online, and if I do I will post it here. So far I have only found similar posts on HP's support site where the techs give a standard canned response to address any generic issue, not looking promising so far. This review took me only 10ish minutes to write, and battery % went down 9%.","This is a very nice machine. Elegant, sleek design, gorgeous 4K display and it's very powerful for an Ultrabook. My only gripe is the fingerprint scanner and the price. I wish the fingerprint scanner were a tad bit more sensitive, and the price was about $100 cheaper. Other than that, this laptop is a diamond. A true Macbook killer.","It Looks great, works great and the fan rarely comes on with basic email and web usage. The failure is the keyboard back lighting. When on, it's too dim during the day and when off they keys are too light. The fix is increasing back light intensity.","Bought this loaded HP Envy for our daughter and she absolutely loves it; all of it.  So, why the the 3 Star rating, you may ask?  Nobody spends much (if any) time reading the 4 & 5 Star ratings; of course the say very positive things.  People want to know what are the day-to-day problems (the nuances) that have been encountered before buying something so expensive, so they read 3 Star ratings more than any of the others; at least we do.  Although I'm confident there are another dozen other laptop brands & models available in the marketplace that dependent upon your preferences would satisfy your desires just as much as this HP model will, we chose this model and are very happy with it as I'm sure you would be too.","Highly rated? What is the wifi that constantly drops? Or the laptop itself that constantly freezes up? Or the mousepad that freezes as well? This thing can't even run a simple program. I knew, I KNEW the moment it took over three hours to install Office365, which I have a subscription for, that there was trouble. STAY AWAY.","I used many HP laptops but this is worst. PC was freezing sometimes and when I re-play movie a few hours  after I paused playing movie, there is no sound at all. After I run HP Assistant, I can hear sound again.","Ordered this as a basic computer for browsing the web, video streaming services, basic documents\/powerpoints. Very good for what it is - fast as long as you don't have 40 tabs open. Same issues with fingerprint reader everyone else has- auto turns off? Weird. Laptop itself is sleek and slim, keyboard has backlight which is nice. Would recommend a wireless mouse for comfort. PLEASE WATCH OUT FOR REFURBS. I ordered mine and received brand new computer. Ordered one for a parent and it came as a refurb. Disappointed in amazon for that convenient mixup. Don't pay new prices for refurbs please! Check when your package arrives. 1\/5 star for amazon but 4.5\/5 star for laptop given expectations.","It's a very nice looking laptop. It looks and feels well built. Very quick indeed. Plenty of RAM and a decent sized SSD. The MX250 graphics can run games at a decent speed and spec if you lower the resolution to 1920x1080. On the downside, the battery life is nowhere near the number quoted on the product page. I'm seeing closer to 3.5 to 4 hours with just web browsing. The fingerprint reader worked a couple of times and then popped off to silicon heaven. This seems to be a recurring theme with this laptop. It's not a big deal, but for the price it should work. Lastly, check the warranty. It should be 1 year. The HP support assistant showed 9 months remaining on mine. I used the warranty checker on the HP website and it showed an in-service date of March 2019. I bought the laptop on 8\/21\/2019. To be fair to HP,  they re-instated a full years warranty. They wouldn't\/couldn't tell me if the laptop really was new or if it really went into service in March. The box looked new and sealed and there's no evidence the laptop is used, so I'm going to give Amazon the benefit of the doubt here.","Totally happy with the purchase. I bought it on Prime day and have been using it for close to 3 months now. The finger print sensor is a bit sensitive and I get about 4-5 hrs battery life while doing medium intensity tasks. But these are non-issues for me. Just so you know - I am a programmer and a power user and this laptop has ticked all the boxes for me. Great product!","Love this laptop......very fast(I do a lot of photography work), touchscreen is excellent.  Only thing I see that is the slightest issue is the fingerprint reader.  It gets stubborn at times and won't read your fingerprint.  Other than that, this laptop is excellent!","I greatly enjoy my new Envy now but it took me a while to get used to it.  I've owned a couple of laptops & they have all have had centered keyboard placement.  If you look or hand test this model, you will find that the keyboard is not centered.  For me, my left hand is off to the side, in the air while my right hand can rest on the computer.  The finger ID needs a workaround since it is not compatible with one of the programs, an easy fix.  It has great battery life which is a major plus.  It's lightweight & I enjoy most of the features.  Overall, I'm happy with the Envy.","Really like the clarity of the screen. So far haven\u2019t had any problems. Will use for a couple months and will update review.","The laptop is nice, sleek, and fast. After 2 weeks of having it, a remote hit the top lightly and caused a dent in the top shell. I feel something of this price should have a sturdier case and not ben subject to dents so easily. I play a lot of old games (2000's-2012ish). They run smoothly and fine, but the laptop overheats EXTREMELY easy. This is on games not running on the native 4k display. I've had to use a laptop cooler to play any games. Even Runescape, a game from freaking 2003 makes this laptop hot.  I do love the 4k display though, it looks extremely clear. The fingerprint ID sensor works fine for the most part. Every now and then it will be unresponsive. Battery life is about 4-5 hours max. Overall, a good laptop but it has it's flaws. Probably would have been better off buying a gaming laptop, but that's not what I primarily use it for either.","Was impressed with the description of this product, so we gave it a try for our new college student.  I am still very impressed with the product overall and the size\/weight is perfect for laptop need.  The 4k screen and overall performance are great.","I do not like this HP Envy constantly auto-ejecting the microSD card, every time I connect a USB device or the power cord.","great overall laptop... love the bang and Olufsen speakers... very loud and projects nicely... Intel core i7 gives it a very fast download rate and great ram memory with intel... highly recommend for a new laptop in 2019","Uneven hinge on the left and right side of the laptop which causes the cover on the left side to flap when closed. The fan is making loud noise more often than I like, and I am unable to adjust the Power Setting because some of the Advanced Power Options are missing which is very odd. I am returning it. It's too bad because I got this laptop at a great deal during Amazon Prime Day for only $999.99.","After 10 days only, laptop is not starting.","My Second HP with similar size and CPU. Very reliable with an amazing 4K touch screen. My other almost identical HP travelled with me for over 45 countries... Great \"Road Warrior\" laptop. highly recommended.","I was able to charge the computer, so it is great.","So far getting used to small screen so will keep my bigger screen lap top.  Keys can be hard to read but it is very fast and I love that.","I like everything about this laptop.  It is light and easy to carry, but has a decent size screen in 4K resolution.  Battery life is excellent as well.","This laptop is light and sleek. I love being able to sign in using the fingerprint reader. This laptop is also very fast and the resolution is amazing.","Not worth the money..finger reader works periodically ..internet speed is much slower than my old computer..","The fingerprint reader quite working after two weeks. I need my computer so I cannot afford to ship it back for the fingerprint reader I will just have to live with using a password.","So far so good. Love all the features you get at this price! 4k Touch screen is a must for me now!","Bought this laptop for my son who is starting college this year. It is a nice looking laptop. Thin and lightweight is what my son was wanting. He loves it!!","It's a great laptop, very powerful CPU, ample memory for both ram and hard drive, beautiful monitor and ease of fingerprint scanner. It would be perfect if the weight is a little bit lighter.","Good","I bought this laptop for my daughter going to college to major in engineering. It was perfect. Light and easy to carry in a backpack. Daughter is using a laptop sleeve and then a backpack with a padded area. Guess she is finally protecting her belongings!","Small, lightweight pretty looking and powerful with lots of speed.","work","the pad is not a good one. The sound is broken, vibrating while the music is reproduce.","If it can be folded completely, the better","Great","HP Envy laptop is a very desirable product with great touch and feel, light-weight, economical on space and great for long working hour professionals like me.","Works great. Quality picture. Fingerprint scanner doesnt always work. Well worth what I paid.","I am a proud computer geek, working in IT for the past, well, let\u2019s just say more than a few years.  I do love this computer.  The feel and look is impressive from the start.  HP even ships it in a very nice box.  I have several other HP computers and they came in plain cardboard.  The box this one comes in makes it look like a present.  Okay, trivial, I know, but a nice touch. The computer is an Intel Core i7, so you know it is going to be fast and powerful.  I won\u2019t go into all the other specs, you can see them yourself on the description.  The keyboard feels great.  The screen is very clear and beautiful with terrific resolution and vibrant colors. The sound, with the Bang & Olufsen speakers, is excellent for a laptop. Oh, my gosh, I love logging in with my fingerprint. This computer obviously has the business traveler in mind.  The body is metal, not plastic, and the screen is Corning Gorilla glass.  You can see and feel the difference.  It should be much more sturdy than a typical cheap laptop.  I should mention it has a touchscreen. Now, keep in mind that the metal and glass weigh more than plastic.  This 13\u201d computer is heavier than my 15-inch HP.  It also does run warm.  However, the lid, when opened, lifts the bottom of the laptop off of a desk just a bit, which should help.  I can hear the fan, as well, which some people may find annoying.  I don't, as I always have music or TV running. Setup was incredibly fast and easy, with Cortana guiding the way.  I already had a Microsoft account including Office 365, so I just had to sign in to connect.  I had everything up and running in no time.","She's just one foxy lady i tell ya that much if anything. Good laptop bros.","Laptop is very lightweight and premium looking, worth every penny.","Cool product","These are probably the last words that come to mind when thinking of a laptop, but this Ultrabook earns its name and then some in every way, because anyone who sees you using this will be BESIDE themselves, and I mean SICK, with Envy. This thang is FIYAH!!!!!!!!!! Let's start with the unboxing: it arrives in a sleek, black box with a beautiful photo of the laptop on its cover, and when you open it, you are awed by the pristine, silver gleaming contraption inside. When you pick it up and gently unwrap it from its plastic film, you are wowed by how both light and elegant it is in your hands; how something so small can contain your life, and then you can't wait to start filling it up with it. You open the lid and lift the mesh cover protecting the keys; you notice the setup leaflet and take out the power cord, plug her in and turn her on. From there, Cortana takes over, guiding you through the setup! By voice command! Very Jason Bourne. You set up your fingerprint log in, sign in to your accounts and then once everything is registered, off into the wild wild web you go. The first thing you'll notice is how FAST this baby is, the gentle whir of the machine as she takes you off to the farthest reaches of the world if you check out the 4K resolution by looking at the Planet Earth series. It's enough to bring tears to your eyes. You'll be mesmerized by the rhythmic clicking of the keys as you go to your favorite websites and download\/install your must-have apps and programs; you will find yourself looking down at the keyboard and smiling as if you've been enchanted by a new lover, and you HAVE! I had been looking for a new computer because I've got this ollllld slooooooooow, 4GB RAM dinosaur of an 15\" laptop that I bought used in a dire emergency because I accidentally cracked the screen on my Toshiba. The \"Gorilla glass\" on this is so beautiful that I don't even want to TOUCH it, even though the touch screen is flawless, like you are on a tablet. The keyboard is perfectly sized and responsive; there is just so much here for me to continue to explore but I am damn near breathless as I write this review because it is simply that exceptional, stunning. I have had some graphic design programs that I wanted to use but was waiting until I got something new so it would have the capacity to rock out, and I can't wait to get started. Where this HAS been incredible for me is Traktor and music programs. No more worrying about lag and staticky mixing because of system overload. This has all the memory and SSD space that you will need, and its ports will more than accommodate any other gadgets you need to connect to it. The sound is exemplary, with the Bang & Olufsen speakers. This is the Ultrabook that every entrepreneur or very lucky student should have; it is the answer and perhaps even a juggernaut to the Macbook. I've certainly learned that just one POWERFUL Ultrabook is WORTH the investment rather than having to replace a tired ass notebook every few years. I prefer large screens so 13 inches has never appealed to me, but this right here has ROCKED. MY. WORLD. I don't wanna go anywhere without it, not even the shower. LOL You have just got to see for yourself.","UPDATE: I've been using this laptop for a while now. I've raised my review from four stars to five. It's true, the touchpad is quirky, but I use the computer with a Bluetooth mouse. The reason I've upgraded my review is that even compared to my MacBook Pro, the HP envy stands out. We've recently moved and I spent the last three weeks using this laptop instead of my normal desktop computer. The more I work with it, the happier I am. I've read reviews to complain about the Wi-Fi connectivity. I had absolutely no difficulty. For a while, I was using the personal hotspot on my iPhone. The laptop flawlessly connected and stay connected for days. Speed is incredible! I've been using Photoshop and variance absolutely no delays even when doing complex editing. I admit that I don't use the touchscreen much. I'm just not used to that idea. But when I do, it's accurate and fun. This laptop seems to be HP's attempt at directly competing with the 13 inch MacBook Pro. It certainly looks like one. It's very light; under 3 pounds. It has a powerful four-core Intel processor (Please note that the description of this product says it has a dual core processor. That's not correct mine has a four core.). The screen is great. It has adequate brightness to use in daylight. The colors are vivid and accurate. The touchscreen is every bit as good as any I have ever tried. I have to admit that I usually forget the touchscreen is present; I'm so used to doing everything on a keyboard. However, when I realize I can use my finger, the results are great. This laptop has 16 GB of memory. That's more than enough to run Photoshop and edit large images. I've also run Premier Pro with no problems at all. The combination of the powerful processor and fast, plentiful memory makes this machine perfect for a power user like me. This laptop could easily replace my desktop computer in terms of processing, memory and disk size. My unit has 512 GB of SSD. Considering that most of my data lives in the cloud, I'm never going to run out of disk space. The touchpad is the one weak spot in this nearly-perfect laptop. I find it not nearly as responsive as my Mac's. It's very fussy about where you press it to get a left click or a right-click. The Mac works with just a tap with one finger for left click and two for a right-click. That doesn't happen with the HP. I use a Microsoft mobile mouse to compensate. That brings me to one really great feature of Windows 10. If you go to the Control Panel and then the mouse screen, you'll find that there is an option to disconnect the touchpad when the mouse is present. This is an amazingly important feature. In the past, I've disabled the touchscreen to prevent accidental mouse activity while typing. Then, on occasion I had a problem at startup and needed to use the touchscreen. Of course it didn't work. Now, if I connect my mouse (Bluetooth), the touchpad is disabled. If I want to do something quickly in the car, and there is no mouse, the touchpad works. The keyboard is generously sized and the keys have a nice solid feel. I have one little quibble: in bright light I find it difficult to read the white markings on the silver keys. In a normally lit room the keys are backlit and very easy to read. I've used HP laptops in the past. I think the keyboard in this laptop is a real step forward for them. Priced similarly to the MacBook Pro, I expected a great deal from this laptop. From the perspective of processing power and useful features, this HP competes favorably. If anything, the screen is better. Colors are accurately rendered, brightness is more than adequate, and the touch functionality is a great bonus. Battery life is excellent. I don't have the standard test suite to verify the manufacturers claim of about eight hours of working on a charge. I can say that I had absolutely no problem getting through the day without needing to recharge. Of course, battery life is dependent on how you are using the laptop. For example, when I worked with it in my car I had to crank up screen brightness which of course, eats up battery. Even so, I never ran out of power. Wi-Fi operation is flawless. The built-in camera and microphone provide excellent quality for videoconferencing and other AV needs. I like that there is a physical switch to turn off the internal camera. That certainly improved my comfort using the device in my hotel room. If HP could fix their quirky touchpad, this could be a true MacBook killer. Even with the less-than-perfect touchpad, it's a joy working with this computer.","To start with, I think thin-and-light laptops are not for everyone.  If your laptop rarely leaves your house, then don't get a thin-and-light.  It's not worth the compromises and the additional cost.  On the other hand, if you travel a lot, a good lightweight laptop is often a good choice. The first thing to like about this laptop is the CPU: the i7-8565U is a four-core, 8 thread design with a base 1.8 GHz base clock, a turbo clock of 4.6 GHz (!), and an 8 MB on-die cache.  All that with a 15-watt typical power dissipation.  This is a \"Whiskey Lake\" class CPU which means includes mitigations for a lot of the latest security vulnerabilities such as Meltdown.  This is a great choice - you have a lot of headroom in this CPU to take on whatever you are going to throw at it (outside of high-end 3D gaming). Speakin of gaming, while this does come with a NVIDIA GeForce MX250 GPU, don't plan on getting too crazy with the 3D gaming.  You can, in theory, play some of the newest games at lower settings, but to get any decent frame rates you will need to mostly stick to games that came out in 2016 or earlier.  Now that's a very general statement and not true in all cases, but if gaming is important to you, this may not be your laptop.  On the other hand, is a lot more graphics than you typically get out of a thin-and-light laptop, so from my perspective, it's nice that I can do any gaming at all. If there is one mantra I have for buying a laptop is you MUST get a solid state HDD.  Magnetic drives just can't handle the abuse laptops take.  This comes with a very nice 512 GB SSD, and it's an M.2 drive which means it's crazy fast.  The 16 GB DDR4-2400 SDRAM is fast, though a little power hungry.  The CPU supports LPDDR3-2133 and I think that would have made more sense with just a small performance hit. The screen is fantastic.  The resolution is almost overkill for a screen this size, but I'll take it.  I also like that it's Corning Gorilla Glass.  This is much stronger than traditional glass screens - and we can thank the popularity of this glass in smartphones for bringing the price down low enough to use on laptops. My main con for this laptop is a lack of an ethernet or HDMI port.  Thin-and-light laptops are usually too thin for these ports.  That means you need to get a USB 3.1 Type C adapter for any extra ports you need.  You can either get a dedicated HDMI or ethernet adapter or get a multi-adapter.  If you are traveling for business get all the above, you never know when you are going to need them and they take over very little space in your bag. Overall this is a well-rounded laptop that's great for anyone who needs performance and mobility.  The build quality is excellent, and the HP Envy line has a good reliability record (far better than their Pavillion line).  If mobility isn't important, then there are better choices, but for a student or business traveler, this is a great choice for a reasonable price.","When the newer, thinner Macs came out I joked that Apple had created the new iMan. He has only one orifice which is also his only sensory organ, but man is he SKINNY! I've finally bitten the bullet and gotten the HP equivalent. I have to say I'm very, very happy. The machine is solidly built with a metal case that gives it a little more weight and a lot more ruggedness. The keyboard and touchpad are adequate, but with a docking station or hub that isn't a concern. My current setup is two monitors (one of them 4K), keyboard, mouse, printer, ethernet, and a USB device charging through the charging port. It performed flawlessly. Screen resolution is fantastic. The touchscreen mode works seamlessly, although it would be nice if the screen could fold back or rotate so it could be used more like a tablet. Oh, well, that's a very minor quibble. Sound quality is much higher than you'd expect for laptop speakers. The fingerprint sensor took a while to calibrate but works very well. I was able to get it to recognize my fingerprint, switched to my wife's and switched back. All that is what you would expect. I needed to do a couple things which put the machine through its paces - running through Atlassian's Here Be Dragons which has several services running simultaneously along with a database server and Tomcat. That's a bit of a load for most machines. The Envy handled it all with aplomb and without grinding to a halt, something which I have had happen with other laptops. Afterwards I played an FPS game and did some JAVA development with IntelliJ and TeamCity which can be pretty heavyweight. Again, no problems. I'm very, very happy with this machine. It's an excellent replacement for my old laptop. And boy, is it skinny.","I've long been one of those \"do we really need touchscreens on everything\" people. In fact, I reviewed the 27\" HP Envy All-in-One desktop many years ago and lamented the limited touchscreen functionality. Touchscreen on phones and tablets work well if the software offers lots of different touchscreen functions, but this HP seems to limit the screen to single-digit usage, even while the touchpad allows for 1-4 finger gestures that can be assigned by the user. On the one hand, that's sad and limiting and on the other I'm not sure how much I miss it. Being able to zoom, rotate, flip, resize, and such when editing photos would be cool. SCREEN I wasn't sure if a 4k 13inch screen was really necessary but it's magical: crisp and bright! (Don't read this the wrong way; I just still have questions about whether 4k density in such a small screen means much. After using this machine, I think it DOES make a difference! I could see a difference between this machine and a 1080p 13\" screen. The touch response of the screen is fine -- but it's limited to pretty much single digit use. The touchPAD on the laptop can handle all sorts of 1-4 finger gestures. Somehow this is not translated to the screen. STORAGE It's 2019, so SSD storage is standard on this machine. You will appreciate this when you're installing new software and if you work with photos and videos. Video games don't always benefit from SSD storage (except in cases where long load or save times are an issue; but even then, no guarantees in my experience with various systems). WIndows loads up and restats FAST because of the SSD. It's glorious if you remember the days even 10, 15, or 25 years ago when you could reboot and go to get a snack. Windows has definitely improved, but the SSD drive makes a huge difference. If you end up with a USB3 back up device plugged into this, doing a full-drive backup will not take all night like in the old days. Transfer speed is great and makes backing things up less of a \"I'll do it some other time\" feeling. KEYBOARD Laptops or \"portable computers\" as they are legally called, tend to have underwhelming keypads. The HP is not awful but it's not the kind of machine I would want to type on for hours at a time. I would have to get used to the wide, flat, square keys. Though they are backlit, which is nice, and they respond well. I've used plenty that are bad. This machine is just \"eh\". Note that I spend much of my computer time on a desktop with a mechanical keyboard because I type A LOT. For short documents, the keyboard is fine. But expect fatigue if you are trying to type reports, essays, articles, or a novel. The keyboard does include plenty of useful functions though: airplane mode, volume, media controls and even the Home\/PgUp\/PgDn\/End buttons that could've been cut from the design. I find that the less than pleasing tactile nature of the keys is made up for by the plethora of functions that are still included. TOUCHPAD The touchpad is accurate and offers plenty of gestures, which can be reprogrammed for personal use. PORTS 2 USB ports -- one on each side of the machine -- are offered. There's also a USB-C and SD card slot. The USB3 ports are modified so that they have a slight hinge -- I guess to keep the sleek lines of the laptop. Basically you have to use the USB connector to open the port slightly so that you can insert it. This sounds way more annoying than it is, but it was my first exposure to such a mechanical feature. SOUND The HP Envy sports a Bang & Olufsen sound system. I will say that the speakers are good and there's an equalizer accessible via pre-installed software. As with all things sound related, you will have to fuss with Windows to ensure that the B&O equalizer is the one running the show. The speakers are good and will let you hear things well even outside, so enjoy a movie in the park, if you wish! GRAPHICS CARD The Envy has integrated graphics in the Intel chip as well as a NVIDIA GEFORCE card. I installed a couple of games that I knew would require some effort from the graphics and wasn't super impressed. Cities:Skylines stuttered at the top graphics options; even when I used the NVIDIA optimized selections, the game didn't run fast,  though the stuttering did go away with some tinkering. Like most machines, everyone's mileage will vary because of the type of game, but I didn't see anything here that was surprising. It's still better than an MacBook graphics card when it comes to gaming, but I think this machine -- with it's SSD and 16GB of Ram -- is meant for multitasking not necessarily gaming. So get some work done! DESIGN HP has designed a pretty, silver, metallic, thin, lightweight machine. I would say that the chiclet keys probably won't stop crumbs and liquids very well and the speaker grill likely will need a nice brushing now and again. A cool thing is that there's a built in foot that ensures the base of the computer isn't flat on the desk surface, allowing for air to circulate. This didn't stop the fans from running, but with a i7 chip, getting rid of heat is always helpful. OVERALL I received this unit for free to review. I have 2 Windows PC desktops, one I built myself, the other is an HP Envy from years ago that is still running well. I've also used Mac portables extensively, so when I used this machine it was hard to judge it in a vaccuum. There are plenty of things I like about it and if I were replacing an older laptop, the price and functionality wouldn't cause me to hesitate. I don't think I could get a cheaper laptop that's brand new with this much RAM and an SSD and a beautiful screen. The touchscreen aspect I could do without, but for MS Office or similar document creation, this machine works great and would likely hold up for a few years if treated right (ie, protect against malware and don't drop it!)","I have been searching for a new laptop to replace my 9 year old macbook, unhappy with the cheap quality of both apple and PC products lately. Apple's keyboards scared me off from buying another one, and most PC laptops today are junk. This laptop is in an entirely different category. For the price I wasn't expecting a full metal body with one of the best, backlit keyboards I have ever used on a laptop. The fingerprint scanner is an added bonus to login, and the touch screen works amazingly well. The included i7 and SSD are extremely fast, and the display looks incredible. The contrast ratio and blacks really make the display pop. It's a pleasure to stream movies on it. Even working on adobe, editing videos, playing music in the background, and keeping Internet application open didn't slow it down. The only con in my opinion is that the laptop stays a little warm. The screen keeps the laptop up off the ground to help cool it off, but it's a very minor complaint. It includes a powercord, 2 usb inputs, an SD input, a usb c input, and a headphone jack. Set up took about 10 minutes.","I\u2019ve delayed writing my review on this to get a good level of experience.  My usage varies from a causal user to a power user crunching on a lot of things at once.  Throughout this varied use, this laptop has been rock solid.  I mean, solidly dependable to do whatever I needed with ease. Such a great feeling with a product like this. I really like the screen.  I watched a number of the 2019 women\u2019s World Cup games on this. The screen was crisp and vivid and the speakers were standout great for a laptop.  They were loud enough that many times I found I was not at max volume... for me and the many laptops I\u2019ve owned, this is almost unheard of. This has all the ports I want and need and isn\u2019t littered with useless ports. The usb full size ports, in order to work on such a thin laptop have a little metal flap that pushes down when inserting a usb cable or device. You\u2019d think that would make the flap push against the surface below the laptop.  It does not because of the way the side of the laptop has an angle to it. The fingerprint sensor is nice and I love having it. I had a few hiccups setting it up. The fingerprint setup app crashed on me a couple times, and a few days in it didn\u2019t work and I had to redo my prints...  but things haves settled down and it has been smooth sailing for many weeks. The keyboard is nice and crisp. It has a feel to it that I like and made enough of an impression that I recall thinking one time, out of the blue, \u201cman, I really like this keyboard\u201d.  Not a thought I often have with keyboards. A nice touch is the keyboard has a backlight that can be on, on dimmer, or off. The touch screen is kinda nice.  I don\u2019t use it a lot, though the funny thing is that sometimes with my non-touchscreen laptop, I try to shrink or expand an image using the finger pinch or spread motion.  On this laptop, I sometimes do things like that.. and it works. I like this laptop. It is a performer.","I confess. I am NOT big on tech terms and gigabyte analysis and the like. I am, I would guess, as close to a \"know-nothing\" user as one can get in this day and age; as such, I can only give you  a VERY lay review and, because it is the only other laptop in this price range I've used, some comparisons to the Google Pixelbook First, speaking of price range, both of the above are CONSIDERALY higher than one can get a perfectly competent laptop for now-a-days, so you would expect some pretty decent extras AND you get 'em! You can see the Pixelbook review for it's here are the HP's. An excellent and sharp screen (with an aspect ration that almost adds 50% to the viewing area of the PB); superiour B&O sound; Built-in \"Cortina\" service; hours of battery life beyond the average; and, my personal favourite, fingerprint ID in lieu of a password (and, yes, you can still choose a password), and more, as they say The drawbacks, compared to the PB are, lengthy and awkward set-up (I had to call customer service TWICE to get into the same position I was in with PB within seconds of start-up) less than responsive touch screen- if you don't touch it EXACTLY right it goes to \"copy\" mode rather than action; A wobbly scree-view that has the image \"dancing\" at the slightest touch (and yes, I realise, I'm asserting both TOO sensitive AND not sensitive enough, at the same time! What's your point?) It come with Windows 10 installed which I intend to keep using because, even though it's much less useful than Google Chrome, it is much more flexible and allows for greater choice (get on the stick, Google!) and a one year subscription to Office 365 which I find WAY too \"noisy\" for my simple writing needs (I'm a free-lance writer) so I removed it at once (Wordperfect is just fine) All in all, it's certainly a worthwhile little baby and should meet most needs quite nicely; but there ARE other choices; Look wisely","This is a incredible laptop and one of the most advanced that I have ever owned. Taking it out of the box I admit to being a bit intimidated. I even asked my wife if she would like to have it. I just didn\u2019t know if I was smart enough to use it. My wife insisted that I keep it and she felt confident I could figure it out. The setup was actually pretty easy. I love how light weight the entire thing is. Honestly, I think I would have been happier with the bigger screen. I have old eyes. I like to play videos, watch movies, and download music. I was surprised at how fast it downloaded what I wanted. With my fat fingers, in using the keyboard I sometimes hit some of the other keys, but that would probably happen on any keyboard. It took awhile for me to get use to the touchscreen, but I love it and it makes it much easier to navigate. I tried using my other computer last night and I kept getting frustrated with the mouse and I kept trying to touch the screen. I can\u2019t imagine not having a touchscreen now. Love it. For me, the fingerprint reader works for the most part, but I have had problems on occasion, but just used my pin. The battery life has been pretty good, but I know that can change quickly and if it does I will update my review. All in all I love the laptop, including the sleek look of it. Would definitely recommend.","This laptop is loaded, making it a legitimate machine for any business purpose and can even handle gaming graphics shockingly well.  With a dedicated video card, 512GB SSD, and 16 Gigs of RAM this machine is LOADED for the price you pay.  Unbelievable value for $1200.  Out of the box set-up was simple, clean, and easy.  The lap-top is visually pleasing and has backlit keys.  The key-board is crisp and easy to type on.  Great thin design will swivel door USB-A allows an ultra-thin profile but still has 2 USB-A ports.  The screen is ultra-high resolution and the touchscreen works smoothly and without error.  This lap-top blows away my wife's, surface-pro in every way.  Other than heat production (no real cooling system), this can pass as a legit gaming grade laptop.  I am very impressed with this machine.  The only nit I have is that when it is open, the screen swivels on hinge, putting the back-edge of it down.  This back edge has corners that protrude slightly to lift the base of the machine off the table (probably a design feature to increase airflow for cooling).  Unfortunately, these edges dig into your legs (if you are using it as a LAPtop) and it quickly becomes uncomfortable.","A beautiful piece of compact engineering, the ENVY looks quietly impressive with its all metal case, backlit keyboard and bezel-less screen  (there's still a black border but it's behind the glass). I was especially curious if the speakers would sound any good.  They're just ok, a little tinny and pinched sounding imo.  I had hoped for bigger sound but I'm not disappointed - it's quite acceptable. The way the hinge jacks the back of the machine off the surface its on seems to give something in there like a bottom-firing woofer a little room to work. I would recommend this machine for somebody like a frequent traveler only.  The keyboard is kind of cramped and overall it's just very compact.  The up\/down arrows are half-keys but there is a full row of home,pgup,pgdown and end keys on the right edge of the keyboard. It has only 4 ports, 2 for USB, a thunderbolt USB port and one for a mini SD The touch screen and fingerprint reader work.","The HP ENVY 13\" is a small, lightweight computer with some pretty nice specifications including: - Processor:  Intel Core i7 8565U (1.8 GHz, 8 MB cache, 4 cores) - Graphics Card:  NVIDIA GeForce MX250 (2 GB GDDR5) - RAM:  16GB DDR4  - Note this can not be increased - Hard Drive:  512 GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD  (these M.2 drives are fast) - 13.3\" diagonal 4K IPS BrightView WLED-backlit multitouch-enabled edge-to-edge glass (3840 x 2160) The computer itself is so thin, that the USB ports were too tall.  So, HP made it so that you had to pull down an insert in front of the USB port to be able to plug your USB device into the computer.  This works, but it means that you need two hands to plug a USB device into the computer.  Of course, you always try to insert the USB plug upside down first and so the process takes longer than it should.  But, it is a compromise to get a thin computer. Pros - Nice screen (4K!).  UHD videos look amazing.  The 13\u201d screen is much smaller than my 15\u201d Samsung laptop, but the 4K and MX250 graphics card make up for the difference, in my opinion. - Comes with some preinstalled applications from HP, but not a lot of bloatware overall.  I uninstalled a lot of the Windows10 apps through the Windows Powershell, but only removed the HP printer installer which I thought was unnecessary. - Small and lightweight - Great specifications for most users.  My i5 laptop struggles under Windows10, but the HP Envy with an i7 is fast and responsive. - M.2 hard drive.  I have these in my desktop and read\/write speeds seem to be faster than internal SSD. Cons - Tight, slick keyboard.  I kept finding myself pressing the wrong keys as I typed.  It took some getting used to. - Odd design for when the computer is opened.  Like the thing with the USB ports, there isn\u2019t enough room for the screen to be able to swivel, so it becomes a point on which the computer rests when it is open.  I have uploaded a photo with this review to show this. - The speakers sound tinny.  Trying to use the equalizer through the Bang & Olufson application did improve things, but then the music sounded artificial.  Headphones are a must if you actually want to listen to music. - RAM is already maxed out at 16GB Overall, this is a fantastic 13\u201d laptop if you wanted something small, yet powerful enough to do most jobs.  I use the HP Envy 13\u201d for travel since it doesn\u2019t weigh down my carryon, fits is small spaces (think tray table) and had an amazing display.  My only significant gripe goes back to the keyboard which really could have been done better, perhaps with indented keys.","Simply put, this little laptop is a mini workhorse. Dont let the size and sleek look fool you. It can handle multiple tasks and programs at once, without getting bogged down. The size is perfect. Not too small to be able to do some actual work on, and not a huge full size laptop to lug around. It's the perfect compromise on size, but doesnt lack any of the power of a full size laptop. Keyboard is nice. Keys feel good when typing. Not too clacky. Fast, fluid typing without any skips. Large trackpad area works very smoothly. Battery life is excellent. Charging to full battery doesnt take any longer than my phone does. Going in and disabling some background apps helps extend the battery even more. Screen is beautiful. You can adjust the nightlight setting to reduce blue light and have it automatically go into effect at a certain time and revert back to normal at a certain time. I had never used this on any of my other laptops or computers, but I'm finding I actually like it a lot. It does make a difference in your sleep and ability to relax at night to get to sleep and it is also a lot easier on my eyes and reduces eye fatigue. Sometimes you hear about things like this and you think eh that's not really an issue.. but then you try the alternative and realize it's actually something to think about and see the benefits. So, maybe it's not important to some\/most people, but I figured I'd mention it anyway since I found it interesting and useful. Screen calibration (within Windows) for HDR videos. Although mine was fine as is. Touchscreen  works without any issues. Sound is good. Especially for a laptop. Body\/housing feels durable. It doesnt feel like its delicate or you have to be super careful with it, despite being the pretty little thing that it is. Its metal, but still lightweight. Feels secure at the hinges. This beauty is worth the investment. Whether for work or play, it is a great laptop and can handle pretty much anything.","Wow. It's been 4 years and the product only gets worse. Some lowlights: I now also have an HP 5200 series printer. HP diagnostics can't seem to figure out how to connect to the printer. In 20 years I have never had such trouble in getting a computer to communicate with a printer. Three years ago, the laptop stopped charging when it is on. I must turn it off or put it to sleep for it to charge. Two years ago, I had to replace the battery. Thought it would solve above problem. Fat Chance. 18 months ago, I had to replace motherboard. Now, I've been fighting with the printer and laptop. Frustrating. I will never buy any more HP products.","Years ago, I had a 17\" HP Envy and I adored it. Everything about it was great. then, the fan died and I had to move on, but I've been wishing for another Envy ever since. Well, this one may only be a 13\", but it's pretty much fulfilled my Envy wishes. What I love most is the full-size keyboard. As a writer, it's more important for me to have this, since I don't need a separate number keypad. The keys have a nice feel, too. Security features such as the fingerprint readers are great. The battery lasts a good long time. The touchscreen works great and the display is crisp. The compact size and light weight makes this a perfect device if you do a lot of traveling for work. In a lot of ways, this sleek 13\" Envy surpasses my old, beloved 17\" model. Good job, HP!","All in all, it is a good computer.  I am an online professor, so I needed something that could keep up with the software, plus have a good camera \/ microphone for the online classes.  Well, after 13 months of moderate use, the microphone crapped out.  I don't move it around that much, and I don't scream into it, but the IT guy said it may be frayed or have been disconnected somehow over time.  This is very inconvenient for me.  Had it been one month earlier, it would still be under warranty.  At this price, and being an HP, I honestly expected the mic to last a bit longer.","This is a good laptop overall. I'm not an expert, and I use my tablet much more, but for the average user I'd consider this  to be more than enough computer. The size and weight are good, while not as attractive as an Apple product it is sleek . The screen looks great, the keyboard has no issues. I don't get as much battery life as promised, but I never do with these  things. ( who does!). My only real criticism is the fingerprint scanner. It worked okay at first, but after a few weeks became but it miss  . I don't know why, so I  skip this feature. Otherwise no other  issues so far.","Ordered a custom configuration, which is similar to these on Amazon. Extremely happy so far, with no issues - however will try amend review if necessary..... The price was great for the hardware I spec'd out. The computer is incredibly fast, booting to Windows in under 15 seconds. With addition of modest video card, runs many 3D games well. Screen excellent, keyboard feel is good - back light is a must. However, the silver backlit keyboard doesn't stand out as well as a backlit keyboard with darker keys.. Everything works well. Sound is quite good for a laptop. Touchpad is responsive. Great all around computer - capable of any tasks and moderate gaming in a slim alloy chassis!","Bought this computer from Costco. 2 years old and the usb connectors are shorting out the mother board. All that Money wasted. So tired of buying more and more junk no matter how, much I spend trying to get quality"],"31":["The fan noise on this laptop is so bad that when you first hear it you're going to think your next door neighboor is using a leaf blower outside. I DARE you to tell me i'm wrong. I have an Acer aspire E15 and an acer aspire 5 (5504) and the fan noise combined from those two laptops are less than 1\/8th the loudness of this new laptop. IT IS TERRIBLE. Think you can live with that? There's more: If you're a long time user of acer products you've become used to the 2nd function keys being assigned between the F3 to F9 keys and in blue. Thats GONE with this laptop. Here's the new configuration. F1 (previously f4) is the sleep function key, F2 (previously unassigned) is now airplane mode\/wifi disable key, F3 and F4 (previously wifi and sleep respectively) are to adjust screen brightness, F8 (previously mute function key) has switched places with F9 now serving the keyboard backlight on\/off function, F9 (previously keyboard backlighting function) is actually the mute function key. F10 and F11 (previously unassigned) are now the volume down and up function keys respectively. Just to add some additional frustration to the mix none of these keys are the second function anymore. So if you're used to hitting F5 to refresh browser windows or F3 to search now you'll need to hit the Fn Key first as the media functions take precedence in this new keyboard layout. This can actually be changed by rebooting and pressing F2 to enter the bios settings before windows loads. Even if you change the F1 - F12 keys back to their original hierarchic order the arrow keys are no longer the keys to access brightness or volume control but instead are music media keys. Good luck with that confusion. This new laptop basically is an all out attack on keyboard shortcut users even the Home key is now a point of frustration since they removed the dedicated home key and you're only left with the numlock access only home key that shares functionality with the number 7 key on the keypad. I also had to finish install necessary driver level software like the \"acer quick access application\" because as this was not installed there was no way to know if num lock or capslock was engaged as there is no LED indicating the status of these keys. Even if you Update the bios to the latest firmware version like I did it still won't solve the problem of the USB 3.0 ports having slower read\/write speeds than a typical USB 2.0 port. Anyway At least THANK GOD on the plus side as a result of all that fan noise you do get ample cooling so the laptop does stay nice and cool..... HAHAHHAHAHAHAH PSYCH NOOOOOOOOOOOO no such luck my friend this laptop gets VERYYYYYY HOTTTTT in your lap and it is just pathetic that for all the fan noise you have to deal with it can't even keep the laptop at a comfortable temp while sitting there idle without a single thing going on. The charger is also not the regular acer charger so if you have other acer laptops that can share chargers interchangeably this one will not work with them.  BTW this is all within the first half hr of use. Imagine what I'll discover by this time tomorrow. Seriously guys and gals if you're a long time acer product user and you've become accustomed to any level of consistency across their products just forget it with this laptop. I currently use the A515-51G-5504 aspire 5 for productivity and while you may think that the only difference between the two is that one has a dedicated graphics card and the other does not TRUST ME those two laptops are like NIGHT AND DAY different when it comes to speed, noise levels, and general build quality. I cannot overemphasize how much you should AVOID buying this laptop. You are going to HATE IT!","Bought this unit as a budget replacement for my fairly high-powered Dell desktop which was lost during flooding. I wasn't expecting much from a $500 laptop but just needed something to get me reconnected. Setup was a breeze, setting it to my preferences was simple, removing the (modest) bloatware from Acer was easy and I was pleasantly surprised at the quickness of the unit. The memory and drive appear to be easily and inexpensively upgradeable but it functions flawlessly right out of the box. I wasn't paying for or expecting gaming-quality graphics but the display renders internet and video perfectly. Those that find fault with this unit must be comparing it to others costing 2 to 3 times as much. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking a laptop to take care of their basic computing needs. Very nice product for the money. Well done, Acer. Update from 10 days later:  Been using it relentlessly and comparing it to my desktop, which had far more memory, storage and graphics capabilities, and I am honestly thrilled. I was thinking of using this as a bridge-unit until I could go back to a new desktop but am seriously rethinking that. The thing that really impresses me is the boot-time. This guy goes from powered down to browsing in about 30 seconds. Not sure if that's just the SSD or newer CPU but I am loving it. Pretty sure I'm going to start using this as my main and adding a docking station, keyboard\/mouse (of course), monitor, a bit more memory and storage, and just rolling with it. Disclaimer: I am not a gamer and I understand this machine won't do complex graphics. Update 2: Just to see if it would work, I installed a $65 16GB memory card to bring the total RAM to 20GB, the maximum Acer allows for the unit (it comes with 8GB but you have to remove a 4GB card to upgrade). It worked flawlessly and it is now far zippy-er than my Dell. From what I've read, the extra memory allows it to run cooler and hopefully adds to its service life. Update 3 (I promise this is the last). Thrilled with this little budget-monkey. Restart time, 25-30 seconds. Startup from shut down (not sleep), 12-15 seconds including pin-entry time. Kicking it up to 20GB memory really helped. For anyone that wants to try this stunt (and possibly void the warranty) all it takes is a plastic spudger (google it) and a small Phillips head screwdriver to take the back of the laptop off. 16GB memory cards are readily available from Crucial and Memorystock, usually on Amazon. The video that gave me confidence to try it was on YouTube but it showed how to add a hard drive, not a memory card. Older Acers had a removable panel over the memory but on the  Acer Aspire 5 A515-54-51DJ, you have to take off the whole back. Don't even try it if you are confused about which end of a screwdriver to use or never read instructions. A final note about some of the drama-queen reviewers that complained that \"it gets so hot\" or \"the fan sounds like a 747 taking off\": Just because it's called a laptop doesn't mean you should use it on your lap covered with your fleece blanket blocking the air vents. Use mine on my desk and on the rare occasions that the fan kicks on under heavy use it makes a gentle whirring sound, barely noticeable. If it died tomorrow, I'd buy another. Loving it Update 4 (OK, I lied).  After upgrading the memory and performing every performance-enhancing trick I could find on the internet with Windows, apps, settings and everything else, I started testing my budget computer. The most comprehensive free test I found was from UserBenchMark and I was kinda proud of the results. The test results can vary depending on the state of the computer but here was my best test (the others were pretty close): \"Overall this PC is performing way above expectations (95th percentile). This means that out of 100 PCs with exactly the same components, 5 performed better. The overall PC percentile is the average of each of its individual components. This PC is likely operated by a technical master!\" Did you hear that? I'm a technical master!  All kidding aside, this $500 budget unit is working so far above my previous desktop that I'll never go back (sorry, Dell). I read that the average laptop only lasts 3-5 years before needing replacement. I'm OK with that and my next unit is definitely going to be a graphics-improved version of this machine, hopefully Acer. Totally pleased.","I spent hours looking for a nice and affordable laptop and this Acer Aspire is what I landed on. Things that were important to me: - Price ( Around $500) - Speed (i5 or better)   * The new Intel i5 processors can turbo boost from 1.6ghz up to 3.9ghz without overheating. This computer is fast!! - Backlite Keyboard - Screen Size 15.6in or greater - Memory - Thin and light - Aluminum Met all my expectations and more The only con, and this is being nit picky, is that the fan vent is located under the laptop. If I have the laptop sitting on my lap for awhile and I start to hear the fan working hard, I try to prop up so the vent can breath. Otherwise, I'm very happy with this purchase.","I bough this Acer a few days ago to replace a Toshiba Satellite C55-C5241 that suddenly died (monitor stopped working) 3 short years after buying it. I was originally reluctant to buy an Acer as I was not very sure about the quality, was concerned about another review that mentioned the fan was very loud, and was not sure I could live with a SSD of 256 only. Here are my initial impressions: 1 Speed. It is a JOY to power up this computer. In fact, I shut it down and then back up just to enjoy how fast it is to power up. I was always amazed by how the Chromebook my son gets from his middle school was so much faster than my Satellite (or even the HP I have at work) was to power up. I guess it all pretty much boiled down to the SSD vs. the HDD hard drive. If you are debating whether it makes a difference, I can grantee you it makes a world of difference. This computer is up and running in seconds. I used to DREAD doing anything in my 3 year old Satellite. No more. It is also very fast to write to the SSD if you are downloading large files. Fast fast fast. 2 Storage. I have a ton of pictures and videos and they won't all fit in this 256GB SSD, but is it VERY easy to solve that. This computer comes with an HDD harness and cable to add an internal HDD (max width is 7mm) and there are Acer videos on  how to do it. I almost did it in about 15 minutes, but was unsuccessful only because I tried to use the 1TB HDD from my Satellite not realizing the width was 9.5mm until I tried to close the case back up. You can buy a compatible 1TB HDD for about $50. You can also add an external HDD of 2TB in capacity for about $60. With either of these solutions you get a really fast computer with enough storage. 3 Current Generation Processor (Intel Core 5 8th generation). You can check the benchmarks on how fast it is. For my General Family Laptop purposes it fits the bill just fine. 4 Build quality. This laptop feels very sold and I love the lighten keys that the Satellite did not have. 5 Really good overall value. I paid about $500 for this laptop, and if you factor an extra $50 to $60 for extra storage you are at a sub $600 setup with newest (as of July 2019) Intel Core 5, 256GB SSD, great build quality, good monitor, etc. I think it is a great deal. I have not tested this for video games or anything like that but for an overall home laptop it is great.","This is a budget laptop that doesn't have a budget feel.  Setup is very simple, even with the minimal amount of manuals and documentation you find in the box. It's very literally a plug and play experience. Specs: 256GB SSD (excellent) 3.9Ghz i5 (you can do better, but might have to go up in price range) 8GB DDR4 RAM (not bad, you can do better) Windows 10 (excellent, albeit with ads) 4 total USB Ports (Excellent) The computer is fast on startup, no doubt because of the SSD and the good i5 chipset that comes with this model.  When multiple apps are running, it can experience slowdown, but typically this has only happened with me while I'm running very intense programs - playing or converting media while surfing the web and typing something.  Again, this is something that I doubt most users of the device will notice, but if you are a power user, it makes sense to upgrade from this model. The other thing to call out is the speakers - they are outstanding.  Loud, clear sound, and easy controls make this a standout feature that most laptops don't have. The only major downside for me is that there is only the 256GB SSD, without any traditional hard drive for data storage.  It's not that there are not options, from cloud storage to removable drives, but it is kind of an inconvenience for those who have large data libraries they'd like to access on the go.  The device does come with a kit to upgrade the drive kit, but few users, myself included, will likely crack this open and give it a go. Overall, this is a classy piece of equipment that belies it's low price, and that makes it a great buy in my opinion.  You wouldn't think from taking a look at the construction or the general performance that this is a budget priced laptop.  It won't be for PC gamers, although a few older games will run fine on the device, and power users will notice occasional slowdowns, but you'd likely know that as soon as you see that this model is on the low end of the ACER spectrum.  Great performer.","Great 1080p display that separates it from some other laptops. Not the most vivid colors, but definitely above average. I bought because my 10 year old previous laptop was finally starting to die and not be able to run programs. I'm getting into photo editing, so having something that runs Lightroom\/Photoshop smoothly for editing was a must. Runs very quickly with the latest i5 processor, and the SSD means boot up takes seconds. The 8GB RAM should be great for most people unless you typically run tons of programs at once. Fingerprint sensor works every time, and the backlit keyboard is a nice touch. Love the aluminum shell and the lighter than average feel. The fan does pop on randomly sometimes and can be a touch on the loud side, but usually pops right back off unless you're doing something very intensive. Seriously, no real complaints at all. If your budget is 500 dollars and you're not using the laptop for gaming, this is one of the best options out right now. Don't hesitate.","I like it, it's very fast and perfect for what I use it for. A purchaser complained about the function keys and their keyboard location, I don't use them a lot and it was not a problem for me. My fan makes no noise in normal everyday use and very little when large blocks of data are transferred.  For complaints about the charger not having a Acer label, many of the parts used by computer manufactures are made by other companies. I got a great computer without spending several hundred dollars.","Coming from a 10 years old Celeron, I think that anything would be great to me. I use it mainly for office, reference manager (Zotero) and some browsing. Pros: It's a fast enough computer. No heating issues so far. Haven't checked the battery yet. Keyboard and touchpad are great. Can't tell on the screen cuz of my sore eyes. Cons: F buttons need to be reassigned through bios if you are used to using them (not a big deal) No indication for caps \/ num lock (there is a free app online for that if you really need it) Page up\/down are shared with 3 and 9 in the num pad which makes my life difficult (I'd rather have smaller left\/right keys and have dedicated keys for pg up\/down) Home and End buttons are shared too (on 7 and 1 respectively) The fan occasionally becomes TOO noisy (at first I thought it was a malfunction of the laptop) Comes with Norton (for God's sake!!!) For non English speaking users, there are only english letters on the keyboard and you need to get used to it","this is an awesome laptop great for editing film. the imaging and speed are top notch.  the sound card could be better, but not enough to take a way a star. i don't know what the other reviewer meant by slow wi-fi, it's the same load speed as my son's 12\" macbook. excellent value!","Bought this as an everyday routine computer that runs Win 10. It has certainly exceeded my expectations. The display is bright and sharp and with the SSD it is certainly fast. I upgraded the Ram to 20 GB and it does everything I need and much more. Can't beat it for the Price!","Ok, so after ALOT of reviewing I decided to go with the Acer aspire 5 slim, read the reviews, checked online and the bang for buck was the best I could find. Got the Laptop swiftly like Amazon knows to deliver and opened up the box. So here are my impressions after 3 days of use (I will update my review after several weeks): Build quality&design: Acer design is pleasant, Business oriented but somewhat dull. The build seems ok, sturdy enough for general use but I would be careful not to drop the thing. the size is significantly bigger then my 14inch dell, so consider buying a protection sleeve for it, But for a 15.6inch laptop it's pretty light, so good for travel. Screen: The IPS screens delivers nice display, nice colors and sharpness. the brightness is more then enough for using during daytime, but not in direct sunlight or very sun lit rooms. The bezels are thin, but the screen is warping if you move it with your hands. All in all a nice HD display, nothing fancy. Touch&keyboard The touch pad is in a good size, ok accuracy but not needle precision. The multi fingers gestures works great. The keyboard is Chiclets style, has nice feedback and feel. But... NO indicator for CapsLock NO indicator for NumLock NO indicator for touchpad lock And the Home, End, PG Up, PG Down are on the NumPad so If you use them, it will be annoying to turn the NumLock off every time. The Backlight keyboard is great, But... It turns off automatically after 8 seconds and you can't change this setting. Why? only Acer knows the answer for that. Also, when you plugin the Laptop to the electric cable, the Small and almost invisible little blue led charging light indicator is located on the right side (the opposite side from the plug hole) and there is NO on screen indicator for it. What?! this is plain stupid. The wrist space on the keyboard is very convenient. Performance: Well, in this area no complaints so far. I5 8th gen is speedy and responsive. the Nvme drive is great and the 8G ram is enough for general use. All in All I gave it 4 stars, because for 500$ or so, it's pretty good deal, but the small and annoying things made it go down in rating. If you want to ask more things, I would be happy to assist, Cheears!","And all I mean by that is that, only a year or two ago, you simply couldn't touch a laptop with these features at this price.  What's \"special\" about this thing is all you get for an \"entry level\" price of $500 or so. Big, bright, full UHD screen.  Quad-core, 8th Gen Intel Core I5 CPU.  Decent size SSD (easily upgradeable to 1TB if you want\/need), and comes with an extra SSD caddy, connector and spare screws to add a second storage drive.  High speed CPU\/SSD\/motherboard bus\/interface (PCIe\/NVMe).  Biometric security\/ID options.  Nicely backlit keypad.  Decent number of input options.  The build is a little on the flimsy\/plasticky side (only the top shell is aluminum, which is exactly where you want it BTW \u2026 to protect the most costly single part in the whole appliance:  the screen), but heck, that's \"entry level\" ... my laptop is at my workstation\/desk most of the time, so that's no problem for me.  All my prior, trusty Toshiba Satellites had no aluminum on the outer case at all. This thing is sleek, lightweight, fast and very easy to set up\/use.  Acer has taken all the most attractive advances in laptop tech from the past 5-10 years and figured out a way to streamline and squeeze them into a really nice entry level machine at a VERY competitive price.  The only thing I might grouse about on this laptop is the bare minimum 8GB RAM they put in it (the removable\/replaceable part is only 4GB), but that can be upgraded to 20GB for around $60 if you need it. I've been using laptops as my primary work station for more than 20 years now, and every time I replace one, I marvel at how far they've come by the time I upgrade.  No exception to that rule here ... couldn't be happier with what I got for the buck in this one.  Only time will tell how it holds up.  Thanks Acer ... nice work, and thanks to Amazon and \"Prime Day\" for making my choice\/purchase even easier. [P.S. to original review:  I had an unused spare HDD that I bought for my previous laptop a long time ago before converting it to SSD, and thought I might as well use it for extra storage space in this laptop.  It installed\/worked fine with the caddy, connector and screws supplied by Acer, but I found that once I'd put the HDD in, the bottom cover was noticeably bulged over the HDD, and the edge closest to it wouldn't fully seat\/seal, in turn, making the rest points on the bottom uneven\/wobbly.  In short, Acer's case design is a little too thin for proper fit of an HDD in the internal secondary drive bay.  I ended up getting a new 2.5\" SSD which fit just fine in the secondary bay, but I SHOULD also be able to put an HDD in there and can't, that is, if I don't want a bulge and uneven\/wobbly rest points on the bottom of my new laptop.  But, since re-purposing of my old HDD was an afterthought with no bearing on my original purchase decision, and everyone knows that laptop HDDs are rapidly going the way of the dodo anyway, this issue falls into the category of, e.g., \"minor annoyance.\"]","The laptop heats up really fast and the fan inside it is kinda loud Update: Ive had for almost a month now the battery life just gets worse i cant even do paper work or do homework for 2 hours till it needs charging. The touch pad mouse died already. Not a laptop that i would recommend. Ive had my old acer laptop for 5 years and everything worled fine before I had this one. This laptop I would not reccomend anyone with battery life just something I would never get again.","Pros: -Screen is bright and colors are good (in the product I got, I saw some people complaining about this so they might not have the best quality control) -The screen quality + size combination allows me to keep multiple windows open without feeling cramped or squinting -Battery lasts for advertised time (it's only about 7 hours with ~10 tabs and a VM running, but that's great imo) -The thing is light for its size\/price -The thing is thin, which is great for sliding it into my backpack -The thing is perty (subjective, but I think it looks mighty fine Cons: -The keyboard isn't the best I have ever used, but it's better than the keyboard on a Mac and it lights up -The F keys default to their laptop function (i.e. brightness, volume, etc.) so I can't refresh a webpage without pressing Fn + F5 (it's more annoying than you might think) -The fingerprint reader takes a couple tries sometimes Things that differed from what I saw in reviews: -The fan issues were INSANE when I first booted it up. But after I installed the updates they were gone completely and it doesn't get hot anymore, so that's nice. -The WiFi card wasn't amazing or anything, but it wasn't bad by any means. I can access the campus WiFi and the WiFi in my apartment easily from every range that I will ever need. -The CPU speed is fine. It handles multitasking well and will be snappy for web browsing, Microsoft Office programs, VMs, and the usually coding tasks. I swear to God some people expect a $500 dollar laptop to be a god tier workstation for their 69-dimensional rendering software that they use to make contemporary art. -It has 8 GB's of RAM, don't open 100 tabs and you will be fine. I honestly believe some of these reviewers have dementia and they open a new window every time they want to see what's happening on Yahoo! News.","DO NOT BUY Purchased product via Amazon 6 weeks ago and at first it worked fine.  Decent laptop.  Today, while using, the screen completely died on its own.  Everything else on device seems to light up\/respond but I cannot see or do anything. After speaking with Acer support, the best they could offer me is making me send it back to them to repair, which would result in losing all of my hard drive data.  I understand needing to send something in if its old, but to expect me to go through process to ship a BRAND NEW computer back, all while losing my data is absolutely absurd. Follow ups via phone with Acer also proved unhelpful, as they made no effort to understand why I might be concerned that I spent over 500 bucks to slow lose all of my information\/music etc. Will never buy an Acer product again, complete junk and worthless service.","I have multiple desktops as I code from home. Some very high end, some low end. I'm currently moving and needed a laptop for motels\/hotels that could allow me to work easily but not spend a lot for something I'll likely wind up giving to my kids after I'm done. This laptop's i5 processor is zippy compared to other i5s I've had. Having SSD out of the box combined with that makes a lot almost instant. I'm used to coding on linux without the overhead of Windows based IDEs but even Microsoft Visual Studio on here is decently fast. Some people have complained about the backlight on the keyboard going out after 30 seconds or whatever (I haven't timed it.) Do you want your battery dying fast? I don't. Really it's as simple as pressing any button for it to turn back on. In the very bottom-left is the control (ctrl) key which I just tap first so I'm not accidentally entering a wrong letter or such and boom the backlight is back on and stays on as you type. Another reviewer said it's not suitable for the dark but fact is that if their backlight was staying off they couldn't be typing much. On the note of the keyboard, it's really nice having a separate number pad on the laptop. A lot are missing this nowadays. Another reviewer complained about the F1-F12 keys defaulting to their functions instead of F buttons and having to use the Fn key. Well, just keep tapping F2 RIGHT after you hit the power button and before Windows loads to enter the BIOS settings. You can switch it to default to F1-F12 and hold the Fn key for the functions instead. Memory is 8GB upgradable to 20GB. I haven't bothered yet. I powerhouse on my desktops but haven't needed more on here yet. Even while running visual studio and installing multiple programs while using chrome and firefox I barely surpassed 4GB. Truth is I've never needed more than 8GB unless I was gaming even though the other computers have a minimum of 16. People are nitpicking at this laptop. It's a 500 dollar laptop. If you need more power\/etc for your money, buy a desktop but then you also have to pay for a monitor or get a computer with a monitor in exchange for lower specs. I've been building computers and programming for 20 years now as well as gaming. I give this a thumbs up. Just don't expect to play any fancy games on it but truth is even the intel graphics has 4GB of GPU memory which is plenty for a lot of games combined with it's speed unless for some reason you need super high def graphics. Someone else mentioned RS3 on here. I've played it on lower computers. It's one of the benchmarks I use. I only play it with my wife for something to do together so haven't tested it on here as of now but it should definitely run without an issue. Also the WIFI chip\/card (haven't looked) gets faster speeds than my tablet or phone. I'm using a mobile hotspot which is speed limited and get at least 4mbps on it which about maxes it. I'd safely assume normal WIFI would be much faster. I haven't heard the fan once even compiling a lot of code but I keep it on flat and hard surfaces. This is another complaint people have brought up... Know what you're buying when you buy. The vent is on the bottom as with other laptops I've purchased. Just don't block it and you won't have a problem. It's a fairly big vent area compared to having one on the side which actually is beneficial to cooling if you don't block it.","Crypto charting, school work, browsing, etc. Came pre loaded with Cortana, initial setup [from unboxing to browsing the web] via voice command took about 5 minutes. Boots up\/shuts down in about 7 seconds. Slim, lightweight, nice screen quality, full battery runs about 5-6hours while streaming\/browsing\/etc. Excellent computer for the price, would definitely recommend this purchase.","A very nice computer, especially at the Prime Day price.  I\u2019ve included a pic of the Passmark benchmarks so everyone can see how fast this computer is.","so i did my homework settled on this laptop based on features that i needed and other reviews. first one i received worked great for 3 days, then it would even power up.. Acer customer service was terrible.. standard . anyway contacted Amazon, got a real person, they sent me a new laptop in 2 days , ( also told me to wipe all my personal data which of course i could not do because the devise did not power up , but i digress ) new laptop in hand, all working, reload office and all my software, and of course today 10 days into owning the replacement speakers are all blown ( sounds like its under water ) going to just pair to speaker, dont really need the sound but come on !!!! i could return it again and get yet another one but i just dont want to go through it all again.. sorry guys but if 2 computers fail in the first week it means that the company cant build a reliable machine.. hate to bash but really 2 in a week come on guys","I liked the product straight from the box. A decent laptop for the money. Yes, the fan will continue to run straight from the box. It's not due to laptop but Windows 10. Microsoft loads with a lot of crap as a package (just like AT&T did on their free cellphones 10 yrs back) requiring a lot of your CPU and RAM. You will find it in any other laptop as well.  Either you need to install some free software like O&O shutup Win10 (or something similar)  to disable them OR go to windows registry to delete each of them (tricky). The residue of Cortona will keep coming up even after removal. There are no choices other than to keep O&O running on and off after updates.  If you don't like to do either then pay up for a higher CPU Hz and RAM  with any laptop manufacturer.","I needed a more powerful laptop and this was the perfect fit in terms of budget and Amazon shipping availability. This laptop has a midrange i5 Whiskey Lake processor with in-built Intel graphics. While this laptop isn't good for gaming at all, the screen is absolutely stunning. However, since the screen is so big, battery life is its biggest compromise. While Chromebooks offer 6-10 hours of battery life, you're lucky to get 5 hours on moderate use with this laptop. So keep that in mind when thinking about purchasing this laptop. This laptop has a fast solid state drive. I clocked 1.5 GB\/s and 1.7 GB\/s read speeds, so you will have no problems running apps. However, I will warn you that this laptop comes with bloatware. In that case, you can use Windows built-in start from fresh tool in Windows Defender to get rid of that. Overall, this laptop should be decent enough for apps, editing videos, etc. Just beware the battery life. Also, you may want to update the BIOS. You can do that on Acer's support page where you can find the drivers and BIOS to update. This may solve some fan issues. Also, for Linux users, Ubuntu 19.04 is the distribution that seems to work with this laptop. You'll have to switch off secure boot and turn on ACHI. Beware: If you do this, Windows will be wiped and you'll have to install it again. If you try to use Manjaro or any Ubuntu distro before 19.04, you will either get no WiFi or a touchpad that does not work. As of Ubuntu 19.04, the only issue is the fingerprint reader not working.","Bought this for my mom while she is on bed rest so she could simply play on Facebook. The computer came with issues. Had to call after unboxing due to it just having a white screen. For a solid month it kicked us out of programs and would restart computer whenever it wanted. Now on 2nd month it started to smell like electrical burning and after a week it just won't even turn on now. My mom is devastated and I don't have the money to buy another. Amazon won't let me return it since it's been 8 weeks. Please don't buy this.","I owned an Acer Aspire E15 with similar specs to this laptop previously so I had high hopes... I was extremely disappointed. The laptop runs fine for doing basic things like browsing the web, but once you start programming or playing games, it'll get extremely loud and slow. It can barely run basic things like IntelliJ IDE without getting hot and the fan running on full blast. The battery life on this thing is also completely miserable.","Bought this laptop, but could not connect to internet to wi-fi network. Pretty sure it was a bad network adapter card, but tried calling Acer support. They were clueless about troubleshooting\/fixing it. Spent about 3 hours over two days with them, then decided I wanted a refund, not a serviced Acer. Sent it back to Amazon for refund. I followed procedures, but each time I checked with Amazon I was given different information. I was first told the complete refund process would be less than a week from Amazon's receipt of the computer...missed that deadline; then told the refund was just been given and was debited back to account... not so; then told that the refund actually takes 3-5 days from the day it is granted. My point is that Amazon service was incompetent and caused me significant problems. Although I am a Prime member, I am relegating them to secondary status as my online retailer, as payment-in-kind.","The product description states \"Backlit Keyboard & FPR Reader - Work comfortably in any environment with the backlit keyboard.\"  What it doesn't say is the backlit stays on for only 30 seconds.  There is no option to make it stay on.  This laptop is not suitable for anyone who needs to use it in a dark environment. Performance - other than the annoying design decision above, this is a great laptop for its price.  Windows 10 boots in seconds and overall the laptop feels snappy. 1920x1080 Full HD IPS display - the screen has very minimal IPS light bleed so black level is actually quite decent.  But the sRGB coverage is only at 58% (per DisplayCAL calibration) so don't expect pictures to look terrific.  Again think about the price of this laptop and the screen is OK.  If you need a screen with full sRGB (or wide color gamut P3 like newer Macbooks) coverage, you will have to pay much more. Wifi speed is a bit disappointing.  My Mid 2015 Macbook Pro has about twice the download\/upload speed.  This is based on the 5GHz band and the AP is an Apple Airport Extreme, so could this be a compatibility issue?  I have Verizon FiOS 1Gbs Internet connectivity. Connectivity - great onboard connectivity options with 2 x USB 3.1, 1 x USB-C, 1 x USB 2.0, 1 x HDMI, 1 x Ethernet.  I can only get the onboard HDMI 2.0 port to reach 4K@30Hz not 60Hz.  This is tested with an LG 55\" E7 OLED and a 49SM8600PUA Nano 8 Series 49\" TV.  Enabling\/Disabling HDMI Deep Color option on the TV makes no difference.  Changing HDMI input to PC mode on the TVs also makes no difference. Battery Life - I can't comment on the battery life as I tend to plug in the AC adaptor.  I would leave the battery at 80% or lower if I know I won't need to use the laptop for a while. Overall a very solid laptop for its price.  I just wish ACER could change the backlit design to allow it to stay on.  Most laptop brands (at least HP, Dell, LG, etc) has the option to leave the backlit off, or at low or high brightness.","Backlit keyboard does come on, but user cant make it remain lit. It's like havin g a reading lamp and having the light go out every 30 seconds. Not practical for usage in dim environment for keyboard backlighting to go out every 30 seconds folks. Returning asap.","I was a little worried about the fan noise and other things that the previous reviewers had stated. I decided tor go ahead and purchase anyway as I need a new lap top for college. The fan was pretty loud when first setting up windows and getting everything set up. I did a windows refresh and removed any bloatware that was on the device and I hardly ever hear the fan after that. It works with Microsoft office suite and is a significant upgrade over my old laptop. It is fast and does everything that I need it to do. It comes with a slot to upgrade ram but runs fine with the 8gb. The backlit keyboard is also a nice function to have with a budget laptop.  The fingerprint scanner works as it should every time and boot up is very quick.","I bought this laptop on Prime Day and honestly didn't expect much. But I really, really love it! SPEED: It's super fast. Even faster than my old HP laptop despite having virtually identical specs. I've had zero issues with it. Processes quickly. Connectivity is excellent. FAN NOISE: Others have mentioned the noise from the fan. Honestly? I haven't really noticed it. Right now as I'm typing this, it's dead silent. When it does go on, there's a slight whir, but only a little. Again, not even as loud as my old laptop so it doesn't bother me at all. WEIGHT: This is so lightweight! My old one was a bit heavy and clunky, so I appreciate the fact this is so light. The downside of that is that the casing does feel cheap. Like it might not survive getting dropped on the carpet. My old laptop had a much more substantial feel and I did, in fact, drop it a couple times with no ill effects. SCREEN: The screen is great. Really clear. The color is definitely off from the HP. More yellow tones, which is odd, but doesn't bother me. MEMORY: This is sufficient for my uses which involves a lot of work only, using MS (especially lots of Word usage), and streaming videos and movies, listening to music...general stuff. I'm giving a 4 star ONLY because of the cheap feel of the casing. Otherwise this is a 5 star computer. Especially for the price.","I bought this for a teenager who would be taking online classes.  It is quick and responsive and should stand the test of time.  It won't play AAA title video games, but that's not what it's for.  I was surprised by how little bloatware came preinstalled.  Norton's useless (and overpriced and bloated) AV comes preinstalled, but it's easy to remove and replace with windows defender.  Some might say the smaller NVME is too small, but for schoolwork and general usage, 256G is more than plenty and the performance is well worth the trade off.  (Seriously, I can't believe new laptops are still being sold with 5400rpm spinning drives only.... can't believe people buy them either).  If you actually need more space, the box actually includes the bracket and cable needed to add a larger sata HD, which is a nice touch imho, since those things can get hard to find once a laptop model is a few years out of style.  All in all, this laptop is a solid workhorse so far and a great buy for the four hundred thirty-something I paid for it.","I didn't have it long enough to give an accurate review. But, I can give a accurate  review on their tech support ! It's the worse I have ever dealt with in my life !! I couldn't understand most of their instructions because their English was so bad it was just impossible. They tried to intimidate me and then got mad because I couldn't follow their high tech instructions. If I had known as much as they thought I should know I wouldn't have needed them in the first place !! What a nightmare. Never again !!!!","I bought the Acer Aspire 5 on Prime Day.  So far, I've been impressed with its speed and the full HD of what I consider to be a fairly large screen.  The laptop is light-weight and slim; it's more easily portable than many laptops but the aluminum top cover prevents it seeming fragile. I'm not a techie so can't comment on many of its features.  (My son had a look at the specs and said that it would do more than I needed it to, which satisfied me that it would keep me happily writing, researching, and globally communicating for several years without the temptation to scream into the void about slowly loading screens.)  I do appreciate Intel and Windows so must admit that I wouldn't have bought it if it didn't have an Intel processor and Windows 10; the graphics are also Intel. The Aspire 5 easily connects to wifi in any room of the house and on my back deck. I don't keep deep, dark secrets on my laptop so have never before password-protected one but, for those who want such protection, you can choose a PIN or fingerprint (and perhaps both).  I didn't find an option to skip this security feature so chose the fingerprint and have to admit that, if I wanted that protection, it is a fast and secure way of providing it.  My grown sons tried to \"break in\" just to see if they could and they could not so they're now teasing mom about what must lurk in her browser history. I highly recommend the Acer Aspire 5 as a fast, easily portable, and attractive laptop with a good-sized full HD screen, at a great price.","The laptop is fast. The screen is great. The fingerprint reader works well. The only problem I couldn\u2019t live with was how hot the computer runs. I actually like to put laptops on my lap when I use them, but because of the heat and the fan location (bottom of unit) it is just too uncomfortable. If you don\u2019t mind the fan noise and plan on using it on a table top, it would probably be a good laptop for you. There is info out there on how to turn off intel\u2019s turbo boost in order to lower processing speed and, thereby, prevent heating issues. But I asked myself, \u201cWhy am I going to purposely limit the capabilities of my computer because Acer has a bad design? I ordered a replacement, just in case it was a one-off situation, but both units were exactly the same.","I bought this laptop to use for when I need to do work away from my Desktop. While it is not as powerful as my desktop; I am impressed with the laptop for the price. The battery life is amazing compared to previous laptops that I've had. I watched youtube and did some internet browsing for about 8 hours and still had plenty of battery life left. Running Visual Studio or Android Studio did cut the battery life, but still lasts for quite a while. I immediately upgraded the RAM to be 20gb total and added a 2.5\" 500gb ssd in the extra slot for more storage. I like that the laptop is easy to open, that acer provides the hard drive cradle to have 2 hard drives, and that the RAM can be upgraded. Pros-  - Powerful  - Battery life  - Easy Hardware Upgrading  - Lightweight Cons-  - I do not like the power adapter. I feel like it is too thin of a barrel jack that it might break easily.  - Speakers are not the best.","I love this computer.  I have purchased so many other computers that were no good and ended up giving them away.  This is the first Acer computer I have ever purchased and was impressed with the speed.  The boot-up time is like one second.  I wondered if I left it on overnight, but I didn't.  It's just fast on its own. Occasionally I had problems with the fingerprint reader being a little fussy and made me have to use the PIN until I figured out it works better if I don't swipe my finger and just tap from above.  Deleting and redoing it fixed the problem. I purchased this mainly because I wanted the fingerprint reader and hate passwords.  I am very security conscious, and all new computers should be required to have the fingerprint reader otherwise I won't buy them. Less hard drive space is no problem for me since I mostly use external drives and cloud storage.  I do not keep a lot of personal data on the 256GB SSD drive very long for security reasons.  I mostly use this computer for online, paying bills, and some graphics software.  Now I'm starting to use it more for other software because it is a fast computer even for an i5.  I'm looking to order another Acer and stop buying the brand I've been using for years.  Even after installing large graphics programs I still have about half the space left. I highly recommend this laptop if you want something fast.  I have been using an older version of a 3D program (Poser), and when I found out it was running a little too slow, I moved the content files from the hard drive to an external drive with my other extensive content.  Those files that are normally required to live on the hard drive work much better on an external drive with other content.  There was a major improvement with opening files and many of mine are several hundred GB's in size.  If this laptop can handle opening those files there may be some luck with graphic games.  I haven't tried that yet and probably won't since I don't know if it will work putting Steam games on an external drive and those files are large. This Acer laptop came with a bracket for having another drive installed, but I doubt I'll bother.  It said in instructions to have it done professionally.  My luck with professionals where I live hasn't been good so I'm satisfied just using external drives and whatever space is left on the SSD drive.","Owned this laptop for about 4 months, and have been nothing short of impressed. Two downfalls that made me give 4 stars instead of 5: Fan noise. It's not as bad as some other reviews make it sound, but still a nuisance. The first few days it will be excessive (I assume its installing new stuff)... after that it's occasional, but still loud enough to be a bother when it does ramp up. Opening it. Seemingly nit-picky, but makes using it less pleasant when every time you struggle to get the lid up. There really is no great way to do it. Those two things aside, its an amazing laptop. I'm an online student and have had no issues out of it performance wise.  Display is incredible as well. Durability is better than expected. In fact, I'm writing this review because of it just slid off of the trunk of my car and onto my driveway and still works. The aluminum on the lid is bent a little but nothing actually broke, which is VERY impressive for a 4 foot fall onto concrete. Also the bent shell mostly resolved the opening issue so I guess its a win win....Overall I HIGHLY recommend this laptop as long as you don't plan on doing any serious gaming or anything like that with it.","I literally used this laptop 5 times in 2 weeks and the mother board fried. Turned out to be factory defect. This means Acer has super poor quality control which is unacceptable. If im spending hundreds on something brand new, it better be in perfect condition when i get it. Also they are so backed with repair orders so its taking super long for my laptop to get back to me which is irritating","Received this ACER laptop yesterday. Booted it today, deleted some of the installed software, changed some of Microsoft's settings, installed AVG and CCleaner, and this far the device is quiet, smooth running (no glitches anywhere, and fast. Were coming from a four-year-old ACER laptop, and this news one is light years ahead with respect to performance and convenience of new-tech features. We are typical, everyday computer users: e-mail, banking, on-line research, and on-line shopping. Does all we ask of it with ease. If it continues to perform like this, it will prove worthy of five stars. Two-week update After deleting some of the programs we didn't want on the laptop; and after installing an older copy of Microsoft Home and Student 2007 (for MSWord alone), this machine continues to be a real performer; i.e., it's still quiet, when the fan comes on; if it 's quiet in the room, the fan can be heard if the room--but it's never loud or noisy as some others have reported; it runs cool (we use it on a desk with plenty proper ventilation for dissipating heat), we never feel the laptop getting warm from use. i should have noted in the above prose that we don't game or watch movies on this PC. Also, when we connected Brother HL-L2300D, the computer instantly recognized laser printer and we installed it. For us this continues to be a five-star laptop. Note: We bought a portable CD\/DVD drive to load Microsoft Home and Student software. The PC recognized th outboard drive and we loaded the software with no issues along the way. The drive is: Rodzon External CD Drive Type C USB 3.0 Portable CD DVD +\/-RW Drive Slim DVD\/CD ROM Rewriter Burner Writer Compatible with Laptop Desktop PC Windows Linux OS Apple Mac. 10\/29\/2019 Update: Two months into this laptop and the performance continues as in the above comments. The fan is quiet, machine time cool, no issues with wi-fi connection, everything online is working as it should, and the display is ss crisp as day one.","When you are looking for laptops on amazon you will most likely open up 20 tabs of computers. After reviews a ton of them i chose this one and it has not disappointed. Here are the things i like so far (its been a week) - Materials very sturdy, nothing cheap about it. - The button and backlight remind me of a macbook (which is a good thing) - 8gb RAM is great for  what i do (mortgage programs, googe maps, musis, youtube at same time) - Fingerprint sign-on on touchpad is really cool and conveinant. - Battery life is solid, not amazing but not bad either - Thin edges - Fan barely comes on and if it does its not loud like other people are saying Cons - its hard to open the laptop, theres no groove to put your fingers so i find myself prying it open holding it sideways","I just bought this computer on Prime Day.  Everything on it is working well.  No delays, no snags, just a good computer for the price on Prime Day.  I returned a Dell computer that was slower and cost more money.  This was a great buy at $425.  I don't know what the price is now but the computer itself works great.  I can't give any specific advice because I don't use it for a specific purpose such as gaming or video. I use it for work that requires a lot of online time.  It works well.  The response time booting is awesome, very quick.","I bought this for college to replace my clunky and slow Lenovo (which I will never buy again). It is light, slim and extremely fast in everything it does. I am very impressed. I love the fingerprint recognition too which makes it even more quick to log in. I would absolutely recommend this laptop. Though I am not literate in Computer, an IT family member did recommend this one which matched my price point. I\u2019ve had it for a bit now and can find nothing I don\u2019t like about it.","I am not a tech person or gamer, and I still need to use a mouse. Needed computer for work. It is fast, quiet, and will open doccs\/sites as fast as I can go with my mouse. Very  fast start-up- I'm online in less than 5 seconds. Lover the fingerprint sign in and back-lit keyboard- two new features for me which I love. It is light to carry and battery life is truly 6 hours with my usage. Very happy with this purchase of speed and features for money spent!","Pros: 256GB SSD, quick startups, has a fingerprint option for unlocking. Light, aluminum, smooth. Have't crashed on me yet for the first 24 hours of usage. Cons: 1. No indicator on the Caps Lock key. 2. The fan vents at the bottom so if you use it as a \"laptop\", you know, by putting it on your lap, your lap will get warm quick especially when it's working hard. 3. The speakers are... not good. I know we're not supposed to expect decent speakers from laptops, but this is a downgrade from my previous $300 HP laptop speaker wise. Maybe you can watch old movies with this laptop and feel nostalgic because the speakers sounds like they were from the 1940s. 4. My new laptop doesn't have a screen protector on when I opened the box. Is it a return of someone else's or this line of brand new Acer laptops don't have screen protectors when they left the factory? Hey I paid the full price for a brand new laptop, it shouldn't be too much to ask for a brand new one. I'm sure there are better deals for $500 laptop, but this one works fine I guess. Not good enough for me to like it but not bad enough for me to want to go through the trouble and return it either. I guess this is maybe what the Acer team is aiming for nowadays?","The backlit kwyboard has a 30 second timeout and you have to hit a key to get it to light up again.  This happens when the laptop is plugged in to it's AC power supply.  This bug has been fixed with a BIOS update on other older models but is still present in this one.  What use is a backlit keyboard that doesn't stay lit?? I've contacted tech support and opened a ticket.  If they resolve the issue than I will update my review.","Very beautiful machine, very fast start (SSD is the way to go). With 8Gb of RAM and an i5 you will be more than served if you just want to use office, browse the Internet, listen to music...  The 256 Gb SSD is not that big in space but is enough to keep the work done. Definitely better to have this storage drive than a conventional rotary disks based one. The less space is more than compensated with the speed, quietness, cooler operation and longer battery life the SSD devices bring to the table. The keyboard  has light! which is a very useful feature. Definitely a very good buy","I love my new laptop. It's super fast! Very lightweight, but it does hurt my back if I'm carrying it around longer than an hour. The screen is very nice-I'm glad I decided to spend the extra money to get a laptop with full HD. For those wondering about the fan, it's not that loud. I noticed it at first but now I don't even hear it. Most of the time I have a fan on in my room and I cannot hear the laptop fan over that. I love the backlit keyboard too. Battery life is ok, but something has to give, right? Make sure you inspect it completely when it arrives. The first one I received was shipped with a dead pixel. I didn't have time to send it to Acer for repairs so I returned it to Amazon and ordered another one. Had no issues whatsoever with the return process. I called Acer and the technician said he never heard of a new device being shipped with a dead pixel. I wondered if mine had been used before, or maybe it was damaged in shipping. Anyways they sent me another one and it's been great so far.","I still can not believe the incredible quality of the screen.  The full HD1080 is mind blowing compared to what I had been using for years. I am still getting used to how Fast this sweet little laptop is as well! I used to turn the computer on and then walk away to get coffee or do something while the laptop \"Woke Up\" and was ready for me. This new Acer Aspire is ready for me right away. Very happy with it's speed.","This laptop is one of the best laptops I have ever personally owned.  It has a great look with a thin design and its response time is unbelievable. I am glad that I bought the Intel Core i5processor, other processors are simply not worth buying. When I launch my browser, it immediately takes me to my home page, and any application I execute is quickly opened without any problems.  My kids use only Apple computers, but this acer performed as robustly as the $2k apple computer my kids adore. For this price and this performance, you can\u2019t go wrong. I highly recommend this product.","stopped working after 7 days if you use acer make sure to always have your files backed up for when your laptops stops working and acer dosent care to help you get your files back","Review for A515-54 I probably wouldn\u2019t buy this laptop again. This is my first Acer, and my first non box and mortar store laptop purchase. The screen is beautiful and the laptop is very light. I love that it has a number pad. My issues are that the sound & videos cards seem not to work correctly, and no amount of updating drivers has fixed it. With the volume all the way up, I can just hear it. This is only partly due to the poor placement of the speakers. Something is wrong with the volume. I\u2019m not a computer guru, but I shouldn\u2019t have to be. I\u2019ve checked Acer\u2019s website and Googled solutions in case it was a Windows issue. I\u2019ve gotten correct sound once or twice, but when the laptop is restarted, it reverts back to the settings it had before. I had to wear headphones in order to complete my video trainings for work. All the video programs run in doubt time speed. The program I used on my previous laptop to play videos won\u2019t play them on this lap top. I finally found a program that would work. My other  complaint is that this takes some special charging cable that is apparently different than every other Acer model made. My cable got damaged, and it took a wrong purchase from Amazon, and an hour on the phone with Acer customer service to figure out what cable was needed. I had to order it from Acer (and wait 10 days for shipping or pay exorbitant fees for overnight) with no way to charge my lap top I use for work. While there are some nice features, I wouldn\u2019t buy it again.","It does everything you want a cheap laptop to do.  Booting up is very fast (about 7 seconds), the CPU is fast enough and I have not had any browsing issues and have many tabs open with no reduction in speed.  The screen quality overall is good and it has good battery life for general use.  My only issue is the audio, the audio speaker is located under the laptop, which is not ideal.  Instead of the audio feeding outward in my direction, it is going straight into the ground or wherever the laptop is sitting, which makes it harder to hear. Overall, if you are looking for a decently priced laptop for school, work, or just general use, this is one of the better options on the market currently.","I use this laptop for basic internet browsing, Microsoft Office work, and online video streaming.  No gaming, video editing, web design, or anything else.  Just the three things I mentioned above. I'm not saying that this computer cannot handle that type of workload, I just don't know because I don't do any of that stuff. For those who need a basic computer for basic use, this laptop is OUTSTANDING!  Sleek design, light weight, high speed, battery efficient, and easy to use.  Get rid of the bloatware and install an antivirus (Bitdefender, free online version) upon first use, and you will love this computer. The only negative thing I can say is that the speakers could be better.  They are not terrible, but I'd rate them about 2.5 out of 5 stars; this can be easily fixed by using headphones or a blue tooth speaker.  Other than that, this a great laptop that I would buy again in a heartbeat.","A surprising laptop for the money! The build quality isn't MacBook-level, but for the $500 I paid, this machine feels like a lot more money. The chassis is aluminum and plastic but it has a premium look and feel. The i5\/SSD combination in my model is very fast for 99% of the tasks I use it for. This isn't for gaming and with its integrated Intel graphics, it isn't going to run Fortnite but for web browsing and work tasks, it's more than enough. The SSD is only 256GB but everything's in the cloud, so capacity isn't an issue. The display is fairly bright and sharp and the keyboard is intuitive and relatively quiet. The trackpad can be a little finicky but I think I'll get used to it. All in all, this is a lot of laptop for the money and I'm very happy.","Got the laptop a couple of weeks ago and so far I am satisfied. Let's see after 6 months of use... It's a good product: it is fast, it is thin with a sleek aluminum design, and it's light weight compared with other computers in the market. Looks nice and works great! Two cons from my point of view -that's why I gave 3 stars on the screen, is that the screen doesn't have a high definition. However fro my needs, it's good enough. The other point is the outlet charger - it's too cheap. Half the cable -from the converter to the laptop plug- is too thin. Not for a laptop like this. Overall, a good purchase for the price.","Sometimes in a Mac world you still need a PC for programs you know and love. I bought this on Prime Sale in July because the specs and price were right. So far my husband has been the primary user, and he has no complaints. The screen is HD so while it is under 17\u201d it shows nicely. The number of USB ports is good and the machine is quiet. It is performing exactly as expected and the price can\u2019t be beat.","Bought this for the daughter for college. Many don't realize Acer is the old Gateway laptops carried on. They are great value and always run smooth. I am an IT Admin by profession and would recommend Acer over many other brands. These are thin, light and have a metallic feel to them, much like a mac. Battery lasts.","It's a nice laptop for the price in my opinion and I would recommend it. I think you get what you expect and can find that info in the specs. That said I will just touch on a few things I've noticed that I do particularly like or don't, but again all in all its a good buy in my book. It's pretty light and thin and fits in a back-pack easily. I think typing on it feels nice and fits my hands well. I think the screen is perfectly sized and looks nice. The fan isn't loud unless you're running a heavy load on the system. Once I ditched the norton for a good antivirus the fan quieted down and I rarely hear it. It's been a great laptop for laptop activities ie. school work, watching\/streaming, buying a cheese grater on amazon. I wouldn't suggest it for serious gaming, use a proper PC for that. I do run wallpaper engine on it and noticed with the more intensive wallpapers it's a bit too much but most ones with a few simple animations do great. I don't Like that it's a bit hard to open as there's no lip or indent (that I'm aware of). the fingerprint reader only works half of the time. The cam and speakers are nothing to write home about.  The battery isn't particularly long-lasting.","Bought this and have been using it for 3 weeks. It's great for multi-tab web-browsing and it's very quiet during that.  Everything is as described. Comes with a frame for an extra 2.5 HD\/SSD which I plan on installing (will report back). Battery life unplugged is decent. Touchpad can be a bit annoying (sometimes I click down and it registers as a right click), but for the most part it's just fine. Very fast and the fingerprint reader is excellent: fast and accurate. I'm coming from a Macbook and this is a welcome transition that cost me 1\/4 the price. Speaker quality is very good. If you're someone who wants better, you'll probably buy a bluetooth speaker anyway. The weight is fairly light given what it contains. The build and material feel okay: not super cheap, but you definitely want to be careful with it (I abused my Macbook a bit because it was more resilient. It's got all the important ports- Doesn't have a disk drive but you don't really need those anymore. It's very thin and fits great into my backpack (I recommend getting a protective case). ALSO, I bought the 4-year warranty with it and already I can feel the peace of mind that comes with it. The reviews of it seem fine, so if I have any problems I'll report them here.","Right now my battery is at 60% which windows says leaves 1h 15mins remaining. That means total battery life is under 3 hours (if Windows is right).  That's pretty terrible.  I bought this laptop primarily to use it on long flights and 3 hours will barely get me on to the plane. The fingerprint reader does not work. I have retrained it three times and but it has never worked for logging me in, saying I can't be recognized and I end up having to use a password.  The position of the reader (on the touch pad) is a bit odd too. It's fast enough for my needs and I like the big screen but if the battery is flat then none of that matters at all. Also there's no indicator at all on the keyboard or display of whether or not caps lock is on. Very annoying.","Bought this on Prime Day for a decent price. Added a Crucial CT16G4SFD824A stick for the maximum 20gb memory this laptop will allow. This is not a gaming machine but is excellent for my everyday personal laptop. The wireless card is a bit weak which matches what I read. I have a 1gbps connection where a lan connection pulls almost 700mbps but the wireless only sees between 300-400mbps which is lower than my Surface which does over 500mbps on wifi. Fast storage, not much bloatware and no complaints.","I bought this to replace my older gateway laptop.  I'm not a gamer, so this is perfect for my needs.  It comes on quickly and turns off just as fast.  The screen is bright and sharp.  Downloads quick, so no waiting as on my old laptop.  And the price is within my budget.  I like the keyboard layout, its like the one on my gateway.  There is a ten key, which was on my list of option I was looking for.  So yes, a great laptop for the price.","So far so good for my minimum requirements for not a lot of money. Irritated that it automatically selected the prime version that charged me sales tax when there was another prime version at the same price that does not charge sales tax. Amazon should have the cheapest option at the top like they usually do. Will come back and update review accordingly. But I am very satisfied so far. Do not notice any noise problems as some people said in their reviews.","Bought the computer to simply run Guitarpro and it does a fantastic job. Fingerprint reader works flawlessly. Very impressed for the budget laptop. Only thing is it says it also has a touch screen and either I don\u2019t know how\/when to use it or it doesn\u2019t have it lol idc either way about that.","Bought this for my real estate agent wife to use for real estate work. Works fine with no problems. Some reviewers have claimed the fan is very noisy. Neither myself nor my wife can hear the fan. Ours is quiet with no issues. We don't game with it. It's used for document creation using G-suite and MS Office products, internet browsing, and internet-based software (SaaS stuff). Very low process intensive stuff. As an office machine, we're very happy with it. If anything, I wish we had gotten a smaller model as the screen is huge for a laptop.","About what I expected. Purchased as a gift to replace a laptop that died. Big upgrade for them in both quality and decreased thickness. Setup went smoothly and it seems like it will do what they need it for: basic computer work like internet, email, etc. with an excellent portability. The fingerprint reader for signing in is a bonus; it was very responsive during initial setup and reads very quickly. Touchpad is responsive and keyboard isn't mushy. The screen has some flex, but not more than I'd expect at this price point. Overall, seems like a very good quality\/value-price point that will last quite awhile for it's intended purpose.","A super deal received on Prime Day to replace an old HP Stand Alone running WIN7. I didn't want to spend a bunch of money for the type of use it would be for and this one did the trick. Much larger screen than I had anticipated. VERY thin - 3\/4\" thickness for the laptop closed. Many features that are nice like thumbprint reader, SSD drive 8GB Mem. She loves it and a very inexpensive way to upgrade from WIN7 which is coming the first of 2020.","2 Days Unpacked PROS: Nice Size Bright Screen CONS: Super slow in loading pages even sitting next to modem\/router Vent under laptop - I wished I would have seen that","One of the best laptops I've bought.  Light gaming, more of a surf\/excel user, very impressed by its quick start-up, long battery life (I know, it's new). Good keyboard, maybe a little thin-feeling, but totally functional....appreciate the 10-key, like the back-lit keys.  A light laptop without feeling too cheap\/fragile. Great value-buy, never really considered Acer a viable brand (traditionally Dell\/HP), but I do now.","I'm very pleased with this laptop. The speed of processing is more than adequate for most needs. I would prefer to have 16gb of memory as opposed to the 8gb I have, but then I like to run VMs and containers as well as do standard work. For standard work, this laptop is good. The keyboard is nice and large and responsive. The touchpad works very well, either through touch alone, or by clicking it, right & left. The image quality is good and the graphics processor decent. I tested it with a few movies and it's great. I'm very happy that it has USB-C as well as regular USB, something every laptop should have these days. The power brick is nice and small. The battery life is good, but not great. I really like how the screen opens very wide, making it much easier to use on oddball surfaces (I present for a living and you can have your laptop in some spots). This is not a powerhouse super graphics engine of a laptop, but that's fine. It's a solid work horse that will get the job done. If I have to be critical, it feels a little loose and the plastic doesn't seem it's going to hold up real well to a lot of miles on the road. That's the worst thing I can think to say about it. The sound is a little muted, even pumping it up to 100%, it wasn't very loud. Not a huge thing, but worth noting. That's about it. It's a good laptop.","Not sure about all the fuss about with a noisy fan...\u2026.mine is as quite as a church mouse. Don't even know its on...Maybe I cant hear??? but any way this comp performs as well as I would expect it to...\u2026.no regrets so far...Glad after reading all the reviews that are positive and only a few that are not....I didn't  pay to much attention to the are not's \u2026.","This thing was faster than I thought it would be. I initially planned on upgrading the RAM but, I am not sure it is even required. Booted it up in 4 seconds today. Sound quality is pretty good and will serve its purpose well. As for the fan noise I heard it spoil up once when I left it idle for a while. I started using it and it quieted down immediately, no problem here. I haven't tried gaming on it, but when I do I will just be emulating so I'm sure there wont be any problems.Overall very happy with it.","I'd probably give it a 5\/5 if I didn't personally assume most 5 stars are spam. The only shortcoming I've found is the battery doesn't quite last a full day when used regularly; but the charge cord is small enough that I can easily bring it along when I have a long day. Also the battery falls a lot faster after it's below 50% - like up to 3 or 4 times as fast as when it's above 50%. I'm happy with this, and I wish I bought something similar when I was in college instead of sticking to a $200-300 price range.","\"No operating system found\", black screen. I tried all the youtube\/google methods to repair.  The hard drive is gone.  Not going to send it back because all my banking\/financial info is on the hard drive and if someone can get into it, i would get hacked big time.  So I have a one month old $500 paperweight.  Very disappointed.","Bought at very low price (Prime purchase).  Only drawback is that it does not have SD card port, but bought $10 USB converter so no big deal.  For my simple home needs laptop is more than adequate.  Training now to use Windows 10.  Windows 7 convert due to expiring support beginning 2020.  Speed is great with solid state drive.  Storage adequate for home needs.  At $389 it was a bargain.  Highly Recommended.","I just got the laptop and I have to say it's very snappy, however, my only complaint is that it has a little blue pixel almost in the center of the screen, it's really no big deal for the average person but I really like to get things as neat as possible.  Acer support didn't really offer much of a solution as it was shipped to Argentina which means it would require me to ship back assuming all expenses just to get that fixed. Also, something worth mentioning is the fact that I noticed a scratch near one of the USB ports, I don't know if it was done while it was being handled in the warehouse or if it's a refurbished product however given the way that it was packaged I believe this was the state of the product from the beginning and to me that means that it was either faulty or refurbished.","I'm super pleased with this laptop.  Bought it on a Prime Day deal. Ran the specs by one of our IT guys at work and he confirmed it would meet my needs - internet use, Netflix streaming and light work in Office suite.  It's fast and looks good.  My last Acer lasted 10 years and never quit, I just needed an updated machine!  I recommend this laptop!","Not a bad laptop for the money, but it can be better. I'm a college student and it's alright for the money. The noise from the fan is really noticeable. And it doesn't take to much to mke the fan start giving it's all. The Wifi card on this is a tad slower but it also depends on your connection. What I can say it that battery life is good (6 - 8.5 hours depending on how you use it). And it does run fast, well fast enough for what most college students will need. So pros: - Fast enough for web browsing, emails, papers, and slight coding - Screen is good, nothing crazy but it gets the job done - Build quality is fairly good but I would recommend a good quality sleeve for this - Keyboard feels great and it's also backlit - It's light and thin so it's very portable Cons: - Fan noise is louder than what you might expect - it does run hot but not to the point that it will burn you - Slight slowdown when it comes to more intense task (gaming, rendering photos or video, CAD) Overall it's good enough. I'm a college student so fan noise isn't a real issue since everyone in class has headphones and the fans are really only noticeable to you. It's great for writing essay papers, web browsing. Basically what most college kids need it for. But if you have a bit extra cash to spend go for something different. Unless your willing to put up with typing on a warm keyboard and hear jet engines when you have more than 5 tabs open then this isn't too bad of an option.","I'm actually impressed by this laptop's build quality, i have the silver one and it it BEAUTIFUL, the keyboard is amazing also, i'm a computer science student so i need to type a lot, and if you have to write a lot of code, or just type a lot i'd recommend this laptop to you, i dont have any complaints with the battery life. It boots up VERY fast with the ssd, like  in 4 second. It does come with a little bloatware but you can uninstall it very easily","It keeps Breaking down for longer than a month now. I tried to connect to support service, they talk for too long and around topic, I wish they would just get to the topic or replace me the product. Super fragile built inside, and need to unscrew 11 screws even to get only to the battery.","Very happy with this laptop.  Haven't experienced any of the issues others have had.  Probably fixed by Windows and Acer updates after setup was complete.  Very fast with SSD drive compared to my previous laptop.  Added 1TB HD in second drive bay with included mounting hardware.","Bought to replace an i3 DELL machine that SpportAssist broke. Some reviews said this one was slow, especially on WiFi, but I see no evidence of this. I also have an i7 8-core SSD DELL machine (blazingly fast) to compare it to, and performance appears to be about right. Overall, I really like it with the full keyboard. I had no issue installing the software I offloaded from the (repaired) DELL. It is now my dedicated microcontroller development and software defined radio (SDR) machine.","Didnt realize this didnt have a DVD rom... my fault.  Not touch screen either.  Lots of extra un-needed apps and programs.  Other then those issues it does what I need.","SUPER UPSET WITH THIS... I was excited to have such an awesome laptop!! Little do i know it was going to crash on me one week into me having it... \"Tech support\" is no more than a youtube video over the phone and amazon just refunded it... I work off my computer and am now out work days because of this product.. Im VERY UNHAPPY...","It's a good laptop. It plays Movies and Videos on High Quility for sure and you can't beat the anti-glare. When it comes to video games, it's not too bad. It's good, don't get me wrong but I am looking for an upgrade. It will run graphics on Ultra or on High but it will become very glitchy. Maybe Medium but that's pushing it ( For RS3 users). I must say, for the price this laptop is a steal. It's fast, plays in actual 1080p, decent with gaming, and all in all, a great laptop. I always have it plugged in though. The laptop will get warm so get a fan for it. The speakers aren't that good either but yes, it does have bluetooth. IT IS NOT A TOUCH SCREEN (Why get a touch screen with a laptop? Lol) For my first laptop, I love it. And I'm not in a huge rush to get an upgrade. It keeps me happy happy happy. And that's why I'm giving it 5 stars. (x","After a week of using, I can say this laptop delivers everything that it promises for a very competitive price! The performance is great for everyday tasks. The speakers are loud. The touchpad is big. The fingerprint reader is snappy. There's even a 2.5\" slot for storage if you ever want more down the road. Just for the sake of the review, here are my very picky gripes. 1. The power jack is very small and does not inspire confidence in terms of durability. And it does not charge via Type-C. 2. It is hard to grab the lid when opening unless you can insert your fingernails in there and pull. Also, you can't open the lid with one hand due to the weight distribution. 3. The battery life is manageable if crank the performance settings down a notch (about 6 hours with the \"Better battery\" setting). But I feel like it takes too long to recharge. BTW this is the first laptop I have owned since being a desktop PC guy for my whole life. So don't take my words for granted.","If you scroll down to the Technical Details, it clearly says \"3.9 GHz Intel Core i5\".  However, when you receive the laptop, the sticker says  \"1.6GHz with Turbo Boost 'up to' 3.9Ghz\". That's just dishonest, shady marketing in my opinion.  Other than that, the laptop runs well and is fast...but it's brand new out of the box with nothing installed yet, so of course it is fast. Only time will tell if it lasts...","Very satisfied","I have been using this laptop for the last two days. Bought it during prime day deal. I am very impressed with it. The hardware is very good, and sufficient for general tasks. I am happy that there is no graphics card in the system (you can't expect that in this price range anyway), as that battery back up is good because of that, plus I am not into gaming.  The display is bright and beautiful. Keyboard and trackpad are good as well. The ram and space can be upgraded, check Acer videos how to do it, easy. Hard drive caddy and cable are provided to add an additional hard drive. Overall I would say that this is an excellent laptop for the price.","Whenever I turn on the laptop it will detect WiFi networks for a couple minutes and then it all disappears. Now the only way I'm able to consistently connect to the internet is via an ethernet cable which completely ruins the point of having a laptop. I've tried to fix this for weeks using many troubleshoot methods but they're all only temporary fixes and the problem comes back whenever I turn my laptop back on.","I am in love, with my new Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop, I could see Amazon had steared me in the right direction, the back-lit keys , well I had been wanting that , but never got it, until my new Acer, its fast, the case is sturdy, the size is just right for my eyes, I had done a look about town locally for a new laptop, everything comparable was very much over priced, Acer beat them all, and it is quality too!!","Been 3 mths since I bought it and have to say it's really good, saw some people complain about fan noise, mines completely quiet barely hear it when it comes on very fast computer absolutely love it battery doesn't live up to what they claim tho I'll get about 4 maybe 5 hours watching movies on it ,but it's not a deal breaker everything else works as they claim.","The charger is not original acee ! this is very strange for a new laptop it is from a company called Delta really disappointed by this","Many things to like, but Imprecise touchpad makes it a little frustrating if you\u2019re used to something better. Absence of touchscreen just emphasizes that fact. Returned.","I bought this laptop few weeks back and after using it for few weeks i am writing this review. I will like to call it the light weight champion as it delivers a great punch with features on a price Tag of less than $500. I am using this one for software like Python, R, Office and it has not let me down by allowing the multiple threads to work simultaneously without impacting the performance. Definitely a great buy :) Only feature missing is touchscreen :(","This PC is great if you're going to be producing beats and need an affordable laptop with quality specs. The processor handles the work load pretty well when I'm making beats. Besides that the speed in general is a plus. Opening multiple tabs is fluent and doing other varieties of task at the same time is efficient. I haven't had any problems with the laptop malfunctioning of any kind yet so that's a plus. The only con is that the battery can get drained immensely given the apps running simultaneously.","I am more disappointed with Amazon than Save on Digital, although they bear some responsibility too.  I ordered through Save on Digital because it was the only option at the time for the exact laptop I wanted.  It took 12 days total to receive it and after I set it all up I realized that the screen portion is slightly bowed so it does not close flat.  Of course my partner ordered the exact same product, now available directly from Amazon, with Prime 2 day shipping...all for $100 less than I paid.  I don\u2019t think I will order an item at this price point from a third party seller again.  By all accounts though the laptop functions well and is exactly what I wanted (minus the screen bowing).","Have had this unit for just over a day.  Build quality is excellent and battery life is as advertised but probably better.  The unit is light with a large display, plus the keyboard + 10 key is a bonus.  We have run it after a full charge in mixed usage for over 25 hours (about 6 hours of streaming video,) before needing to plugged in.  Ports for USB (A and C) are plentiful as are HDMI, Ethernet, etc.  The unit was delivered ahead of schedule and set up was easy.  Even at the non-prime day price, this computer is a great value.  My only regret is not buying two.  Kind of wish it had a touch display, but at the price, who's complaining?","The one she got was working good but it got hot once she connected and external device to read the SD card. The one I got got very hot most of the time and it crash once. It also when black a couple of times so I sent that one back.","Bought for my son for his freshman year of college. Stopped working 2 days before his first day. of class. Called support snd was told it will take at over 10 days to get fixed. Nothing like adding more stress to a freshman student.  This repair time is unacceptable.","for the most part i am extremely happy with this lap top. it was reasonably priced and I've only had a few issues with the display settings and with the computer going to sleep on me. but i think i figured it out. besides that, the screen is a nice size for me and it is very thin and not too heavy.","I am a student currently in college and I am not very happy with this laptop because it keeps having issues with the wifi it never loads anything and when it does all the pictures from my textbooks wont load and it keeps saying it is not connected to the wifi all the time I have already factory reset and did everything I could do and I am still having issues this laptop does not seem to be reliable at all","Yes, it's only day 2, but this laptop seems great\ud83d\ude0d I absolutely love everything about! I will however update this within the next little while \ud83d\ude01","Have had the computer 1 day. The graphics are good. We love the physical size and weight. Would be a great computer if it didn't run really hot. Unfortunately after only about 2 hours of running, it is very hot. I am not sure this is good for a computer that will be used a lot.","I don't know why some report overheating. It has no fan, solid state hard drive and never feels even warm to the touch. I am glad it has no touchscreen , I don't like to smear around on one. I always use a mouse. I am not a gamer, but it feels super fast.","good value for what you get.  bought it for my teenage daughter and she has nothing but good things to say about it.  makes excuses to do her homework just so she can use the computer. not the most powerful for gaming but great for everything else.","I ordered this laptop because I needed a reliable laptop for a reasonable price. This laptop was perfect for just that. The screen quality is excellent, and the keyboard quality is durable and nice. Its pretty light weight to carry. I love the option of having a fingerprint password. Makes it quick to Log onto the computer multiple times at school. Also, ITS FASTT!!!","Worst computer I\u2019ve ever purchased, worked fine for 30 days and then the WiFi couldn\u2019t connect. Did factory resets and nothing works for the computer to go online. I received a faulty poorly made product which this seller can\u2019t help with since it basically died at the same time as their return window ended. Crap service, crap computer, don\u2019t buy it or at least not from someone that\u2019s not Acer direct. Acer won\u2019t allow a return or replacement because they weren\u2019t the seller.

Full HD display, No touch screen adds to the longer battery life. There is a finger scanner for quick login which is a nice bonus. You can play light games but nothing that is too demanding since it does not have a dedicated graphics chip.","My old computer had an argument with a glass of water and lost. I am not a gamer and I don't use it for work. I got it for casual surfing and videos.

I use this primarily for work (High School English Teacher).","Had a friend recommend this computer to me,  and I love it! Easy to use and operate and super light weight!"],"32":["Overview: This machine does a pretty good job living up to its advertised capabilities.  This review is based on my impressions after a couple of days with the unit - I may update it later if anything relevant occurs long-term. Testing Methodology: I don't have a lot of sophistocated instruments for measuring the actual brightness, color gamut etc...  In general I stuck to sofware based tests and my somewhat subjective eyeballs. Construction: The top (back of the screen) is metal, as is keyboard and palm-rest area, the screen bezel and bottom are plastic.  This was a pretty good design decision as it keeps the bottom from turning into a hotplate in your lap.  The hinge feels solid and moves very smoothly. Screen: The screen is rated about 300 nits.  Just based on comparisions with others with similar ratings this screen seems like it might actually be a little brighter than it's rated.  It's perfectly visible outside in daylight as long as there isn't direct sunlight on the screen.  The 144hz refresh rate is a really nice feature and allows for some rock-solid motion.  The contrast and color gamut are very effective and pleasing to the eye.  I don't have a tool for measuring the colors so this could just be clever engineering, but nothing here feels like a compromise.  The screen does suffer from uneven backlight blooming so on a completely dark image, there are bright splotches around the margin, but this is pretty typical for an IPS LCD. GPU: The GPU seems to be able to take just about everything I've thrown at it on the most insane settings and I haven't noticed any performance problems.  The Witcher 3 and Darksiders Warmastered Edition look amazing in motion, with the latter running at a V-sync'd 144hz with no problems at all. It pulled a very respectable score of 14,000+ on the Final Fantasy XIV Stormbringer Benchmark with everything turned up to maximum and every optimization turned off. The laptop comes pre-configured with an overclock setting called \"Turbo\" mode which is activated by a button to the upper-left of the keyboard.  You can, of course, create your own overclocking profiles. In order to more efficiently use power, conserve battery, and cut down on fan noise, as with most contemporary gaming laptops, the Predator Helios 300 uses Intel Optimus.  In a nutshell, Intel Optimus switches dynammically between the considerably less powerful and less power-hungry integrated Intel GPU and the GTX-1660ti.  The system will attempt to guess which GPU should be used for a given process, but you can deliberately control this in a couple of different ways.  From the Nvidia Control Panel, you can set the GPU to use for a given application so that whenever that program (i.e. your games) are launched it automatically does so under the Nvidia card.  Alternatively you can tell the system to favor the Nvidia card for everything (not a great idea unless you want to listen to the fan all the time and watch your battery level drop before your  eyes).  And Lastly, there's a context menu item called \"run with graphics processor\" that lets you select which to use by right-clicking on an application before you launch it.  So Optimus is pretty useful for balancing performance, but it somes with a couple of unfortunate tradeoffs.  There is no \"Display\" option in the Nvidia control panel because Optimus dynamically manages those settings, and G-Sync and Fast Sync options are not possible though technically the GPU is capable of using them. Keyboard: The keyboard is, for the most part, great.  The keys are spaced reasonably, slightly convex, quiet and just have a nice feel.  I'm used to pressing harder so my fingers have a tendency to bounce and I wind up typing double letters occasionally, but it's nothing I can't adjust to. (I tried using the Windows \"Filter Keys\" setting to help with this but it's more of an accessiblity option and is too restrictive)  The width of the keyboard allows for the incorporation of a 10-key keypad on the right, however the keys are much narrower than the rest of the keyboard, and the 0 key has been shifted to the center column to accomodate the arrow keys, so it's a bit of compromise.  It's only really annoying when trying to type in a large string of numbers such as when entering a license key. Trackpad: The trackpad is generously large and very sensitive.  There are no mouse buttons, but the bottom of the pad is clickable with the right and left corners representing the right and left mouse buttons. Sound: The laptop comes with a pair of down-firing stereo speakers that are okay for what they are.  They're tinny and can't really get loud enough to overpower the fan noise when playing games.  Noise cancelling or noise isolating headphones are pretty much mandatory for gaming or anything that drives the GPU.  That said, the virtual surround effect is surprisingly convincing. Backlighting: They changed last-year's red backlight to blue, which I think is somewhat more pleasing to the eye, but it's kind of a deal breaker in the use-it-in-bed scenario because the blue light spectrum interferes with your ability to achieve REM sleep.  It's a thing, look it up. Battery: It runs on a 3720mAh battery which is about 25% more capacity than last year's model.  Trying to give a \"it lasts this many hours\" number is kind of pointless in my opinion because it's affected by background processes, screen brightness, what you're doing with it, the age of the battery, etc. Let's be honest though, no one is buying this laptop for its battery life.  Nvidia has several settings which seek to improve battery life while gaming, but they all involve framerate throttling.  If you want to game while not connected to mains power, then you're probably playing games that would work just fine on a laptop with a fraction of the power of this thing. Webcam\/Mic The webcam maxes out at 720p30.  That resolution also holds for still images so it seems like that's the geometry of the sensor itself.  It works okay in relatively low light - with the brightness gain cranked all the way up, the glow of the screen is enough to allow it to capture a usable amount of detail in a dark room.  In a normally lit room the image is a bit darker than what you would see with your eyes, and as with most webcams, colors are little washed out.  And like most pinhole cameras, the brighter the lighting the clearer the picture and the more faithful the colors.  This would be perfectly serviceable in a well-lit office, or outdoors.  The stereo microphone picks up voices clean and clear. Network: The \"Killer\" WiFi chip in this machine is amazingly fast.  My Internet service tops off at around 25MB\/s, and this Wi-Fi card easily hit 23MB\/s (that's bytes, not bits) when downloading games from GOG Galaxy.  I was pleased to see that the laptop also maintains an RJ-45 for wired ethernet connnectivity - it uses a clever hinged port to maximize space while there's nothing plugged in. Hardware Accessibility\/Upgrade difficulty: Unlike last year's model, there are no quick access ports - if you want to get at the Wi-Fi, M.2, Memory or SSD area, you have to remove the entire bottom of the shell.  Fortunately everything important is within reach after you take out the 10 philips screws and pull the bottom cover off. Cooling: This is by far the best vented laptop I've ever seen.  The heatsink fins and fans are clearly visible through the myriad slits on the bottom, sides and back.  The fans are as noisy as any laptop I've ever used, but not worse, though when you hit that Turbo button to kick in the overclocking profile and those fans crank up, it sounds like a jet preparing to take off, so if you're doing any moderate to heavy gaming, noise isolating or noise cancelling headphones are not optional. Storage: A 256GB PCIe M.2 drive is installed.  It tops off around 1.5Gbps which is a pretty respectable speed and pretty performmant.  It's not a lot of space though so it's fortunate that there's another M.2 slot to install another card later on.  There's also a bay for a 2.5\" drive, but the bracket and SATA connector kit comes with a warning that Acer no longer considers this a user serviceable operation and implies that your warranty may be voided by attempting to install it yourself. Instructions\/Documentation: The documentation for the hardware was honestly a little disappointing.  It gives you a tour of the ports and the keyboard, but doesn't include anything about how to install M.2 devices, upgrade memory or install a 2.5\" drive - these aren't exactly rocket surgery, but it still feels like an oversite that Acer doesn't want to show you what goes where.  The SATA adapter for the 2.5\" drive requires connnection to a proprietary ribbon socket which they altogether fail to tell you how to locate on the motherboard. Other Stuff: I had to chuckle when I saw the \"Turbo\" button.  I'm old enough to remember when that was a thing on the Intel 386 CPUs, and unironically it does pretty much the same sort of thing here. The BIOS is about the most bare-bones affair I've seen recently, with no options for controlling and\/or disabling the integrated GPU. The system came with Norton Ultimate installed.  Thankfully that's about the only piece of garbageware installed by Acer.  Microsoft's default \"Windows Defender\" is far superior to Norton and unlike Norton it won't waste a ton of CPU cycles for no good reason.  Windows Defender is already part of Windows 10 - just uninstall Norton and reboot to activate it.  It's better protection and doesn't expire and beg for more money in a year. I've attached an image of the installed applications to this review so you can see what it comes with. Summary: Pros: - Looks and feels sleek and solid - That 144hz screen is fantastic - 300 nits is not MacBook bright, but it's usable in daylight - Comes with fast PCIe M.2 Storage - Wi-Fi is incredibly fast - Powerful GPU - Very effective cooling - I never saw it break 46C Cons: - Blue backlighting is bad for bedtime use - Fans get loud when the system is under a load - No option to disable Optimus and enable GSync (so no GSync) - Norton Ultimate - seriously? Updates: (As I encounter new things that I think are relevant, I'll update the review here) - The USB-C socket is not wired to the video card so it's not possible to output video.  The laptop provides HDMI and a mini-DPort so it's not lacking in output options, but still.","Laptop performs great. You'll be able to run pretty much any AAA title at Max - Ultra at reasonable frame rates. Cooling much better then the 2018 model and I didn't notice any thermal throttling. You are unable to upgrade the Nvidia driver manually. You must use GeForce experience. 144hrz display is good not great but for the price it's unbeatable. Average backlight bleed which is typicall for IPS. Little to no screen tearing without vsync. No GSYNC which is fine. Speakers better then expected for type of laptop. Fan is loud but not piercing under load. Keyboard is soft but deliberate, great for typing. Very intrusive junkware had to be removed so notifications weren't popping up every 20 minutes, annoying but typical. Laptop is thinner then the more expensive ASUS & MSI competition. The half metal case is confidence inspiring. The bottom is very easy to remove with a few screws and gives you quick access to all replaceable parts  Normally I would not buy an Acer but their Predator line shows quality they have not shown in the past. I'm disappointed it's not RGB like it was advertised on Acers website (cross-referenced specific model #) but for the performance it's not too upsetting. Would recommend as long as the quality lasts as long as it looks good. Edit Make sure your dedicated GPU is enabled and set as default. Optimus is frustrating. But that is Nvidia and Intel's fault. Not Acer's Battery life comments. If you were expecting good battery life out of a laptop you should not be looking at Gaming laptops. There is alot of powerful hardware in this laptop and it gives up battery life for portability. Although I would have given up the 2.5 bay for a bigger battery. Give and take. If you think it's overheating while gaming the components will run fairly hot by default. Even up to 97c . You should really set a fan profile before assuming it's overheating. If it's really was overheating it would shut off automatically. Otherwise it idles at about ,45-55c in a 22c (72f) room. Also set your per game profile. It should not throttle under 80c +- you don't need to use turbo mode. The fan at 40-75 percent works fine in most cases. And is not too loud under 4400 rpm If you think the storage is too small. They placed this laptop in probably the biggest part of the market. You are getting a Hex core processor and a mid-high range GPU and a 144hrz pannel. Until recently you could not get a laptop with this type of hardware for under ,15-1600$. It has 2 m.2 slots and a 2.5 inch bay with provided install hardware.  They saved you money so you can get a plethora of storage options on your own. This is by far one of the simplest laptops to upgrade with 1 pannel. They also sell upgraded ones so you can skip the upgrade If you find that your unit is hitting 90c and above during game sessions and you feel comfortable using throttle stop. most of the temperature is because it turbos to 3.9ghz roughly. dropping the offset for each core will significantly drop your temps. You may lose 1 - 2 frames if you get too aggressive but you can dial it in to your liking. I can game a 70c with turbo at 3.1ghz There will be a small percentage of you with faulty units. Maybe consider an RMA before you trash talk the machine.","I almost cancelled my ordered when realizing the only reviews were all from Vine reviewers! I am glad I didn't. I have only owned 1 other laptop which lasted almost a decade. That and my PC's is what I have to compare it too. When I buy computer stuff I try to get the best for the money that will not be out of date for many years. In my mind I try to buy things that will be good for 8-10 years.   After looking at many laptops from top brands, and reading reviews and articles from the PC world, I realized I wanted a monitor at or above 120HZ. This one is 144HZ amazing! My old laptop became no fun when the cpu was way passed it's prime, so I wanted no less than a I7 8th gen, this one is the 9th gen! When it came to the video I wanted a 1060 or faster. This has the 1660ti, yesterdays beast card. The last on my concerns were heating up while under load. I am still concerned with heating up under load, but at this point it seems to handle everything I have put at it so far. The Predator Key pulls up the CPU, GPU,and Laptop temps, which has not gone much higher than mid 70's. The 2 games my kids and I have played on it might not be the most demanding either at this point.   I like the way the key board feels also, and I use a wireless mouse. I can not say enough about the monitor, it is just great! I have only had the laptop for a week at this point and will update my review if something great or terrible comes to light. Best of Luck! Troy *6 week update* I am very happy with this laptop. It is a daily used PC, and it is fantastic. I'm unable to find any negatives at this time, unless your looking at the 2060+ video cards that have come out this year. so far the 1660ti has been great. I will update again with anything new. At this time this was a great and enjoyable purchase.","UPDATE: July 16, 2019. Confirmed... Amazon DOES have a secret, unpublished \"high value\" exchange policy. It varies between $500 or $1,000 depending on your \"status.\" Of course, they don't publish this, nor does Amazon provide you with any information to let you know what is your status. So, not only will Amazon not replace\/exchange this item, they still can't provide a refund until they've had it in their shipping center for 2 weeks. I'll update this in 2 weeks to see if a refund is provided. UPDATE: July 12, 2019. Seems as if Amazon cannot process exchanges. Instead, they have a secret, unpublished policy that for \"high value items,\" which are items greater than $500... they DO NOT provide exchanges. Instead, you have to return the item, wait for a refund, and then they have the gaul to ask that you buy it again!  So, next time, I'll purchase my \"high value items\" at a brick and mortar store where I know I can get an exchange if needed. On specs, this is an amazing laptop. Had it for 3 days, and it performed very well. However, and this is a BIG however, turns out that the Acer predator helios 300 series has a history of BSOD\/black screens. Sure enough, the laptop froze up and despite spending nearly 2 hours with Acer tech support, there was nothing they could do. Oddly enough, after removing 1 RAM module, the laptop fired back up. But, I didn't buy a laptop with only half the RAM. Clearly, Acer needs to address this issue, as if you do your homework (I wish I had), you'll see lots of issues with black screens\/unresponsive computers. Would I buy this again? No way. By comparison, I have an Asus that I've had ZERO issues with. In the future, I'm buying Asus, HP, Dell or anyone else but Acer.","This is hands down the best laptop, or even desktop, I have ever owned. That's coming from long time AMD guy. It  pains me to say this, but AMD just doesn't exist in the mobile market at  this time. If you need real power in a laptop, Intel and Nvidia are the  only game in town now. I've started traveling more lately so I  needed a laptop that could essentially replace my desktop(s) and this Acer  has far surpassed my expectations in that regard. See attached image.  The construction is solid, and it looks great, in my opinion...sleek  enough to pass as professional with just a hint of \"gaming laptop\" appeal.  The fans can get loud when you're hammering on it, that's true. There is no  free lunch, a laptop must have compromises when they are stuffed with  this kind of hardware. That said, unless you run it in Turbo (read  overclocked) mode all the time I find the fan noise more than reasonable. I  have not found a game, or CPU workload, that required me to use Turbo in  order to have a good experience. It's just stupid fast. In my opinion, you  can't find a better laptop for the money, period.  As you can tell, I love it. Now, I'll answer some of the questions I had  before buying it since there seems to be some confusion. The following  information is from my own experience, if Acer changes things up in the future I can't help you. The is no RGB on this (the 1660ti) version. The keyboard is blue backlit only. For me, this is a pro as I\u2019m tired of red, and I think RGB is a silly overplayed gimmick. If you go to Acer directly, there are different versions with different features. The RAM (16gb total) is 2x8gb sticks of Kingston 2666mhz...it is in dual channel. It scores well in the benchmarks that I have ran and from my own experience 16gb is more than enough for 95% of people out there. It's enough for 100% of the gamers. The included 256gb M.2 style SSD is also from Kingston and seems to perform quite well. There is an additional empty M.2 slot in there. I didn't use it, so I have no idea what will or won\u2019t work in that slot. I decided to use the open 2.5 inch HDD\/SSD space for my storage needs. (Please, for all that is sacred, don't you dare put a regular 2.5 HDD in there and hamstring this fine machine). I opted to stay with the Kingston memory theme and stuck a 1tb Kingston 2.5 SSD in there. So, as of this writing I have 186gb free on my C: Drive (it's got all the normal stuff loaded up), and I'm loading my giant Steam library and other big programs onto the 1tb D: Drive. This, in my opinion, is the way to go. The CPU is an Intel last gen refresh (you know 14+++++ lol). That said, it's a good one. 6 cores, 12 threads at 45 watts it tough to beat...actually, I don't think anyone is beating it right now. AMDs mobile Ryzens are topping out at 4 core, 8 threads as of the time of this writing.  I'm sure higher core count CPUs make their way into the laptop market in  the next few years, but for now...this is the best game in town. Also, it's  2019, you don't want a quad core, no matter who makes it. Trust me. The 1660ti is a beastly little thing. Nvidia's naming scheme is clearly insane, but this guy is sweet. It's based on the new Turing architecture and performs quite well. It will smoke a GTX1060 and spit at the heels of a decent desktop Vega 56...and all the while using way less power. For desktops it's a hard card to love, but in a laptop it's brilliant.  The battery is fine for what it is. People wanting 10-hour battery life  and 144 frames per second in their games, pull yourself together people.  Sacrifices must be made for mobility. When on battery the laptop  automatically switches over to the Intel IGP and doing regular (non-taxing)  stuff will get you 4-5 hours. You can force the 1660ti to play ball  while running on the battery through the Nvidia control panel...but I hope  you don't plan on a long gaming session...maybe 1.5 hours. Pro tip: You  want to game? Find a wall outlet.  The \"Killer\" WIFI and internet stuff...actually works. I was getting  stupid fast wireless downloads at distances away from my router that  shocked me. I'm not even going to run an ethernet cable unless I'm playing  a FPS. Blazing fast connection and rock solid so far.  Sadly, you will have to remove Norton (duh) and Windows 10 comes with the  usual fluff that nobody wants...it is what it is. Took me about 30  minutes to remove all the silly stuff and download all the stuff I actually  needed. Keep the Predator App, I think they will be  useful (Update: It is, see below update). When I was setting up this machine, I did log it into my Microsoft  account, and it appears I have Office installed. Not sure if that's because  I have Office on another machine registered to my account...or if this  comes with Office. Your mileage may vary.  The \"Turbo\" button...here's the deal. It only works when plugged in and  above 40% battery. It basically raises the voltage limits of the machine,  while turning on the fans full blast. This results in the CPU auto boosting  on more cores and higher than usual. Oh, and it also overclocks the 1660ti!  Yes, yes you read that right...basically it's an \"overclock button\".  Normally I would laugh at such silliness, but I have to say...it works. It  sounds like a small jet, but it goes like one too. I use it for  benchmarking and playing around...but you could game with it in Turbo,  provided you have headphones. All that said, I'm getting like 62 fps in  AC Odysseus on Very High WITHOUT \"Turbo\". If you're familiar  with this painfully un-optimized AAA title you will understand how  impressive that is, lol. Love that game though...don't judge me.  Hope this helps someone make a big decision. Edit: Update 7\/18\/19 I read a review where someone was having issues with an echo on the audio. I didn't have this problem as I have an external sound processor that I use. At any rate, I plugged in my headphones directly (1\/8th jack) and sure enough...there was an echo. After a bit of investigation, it's from the \"Waves MaxxAudio\" App. This app can be tuned\/disabled through the Predator App under the App center portion. Turn that guy off, and your echo goes away. That particular App might be useful in a gaming situation, but if your just watching videos or listening to music it falls a little short. I never thought I would say this, but let Windows control your sound and you will be fine, lol. Edit 9-25-19. Man I love this thing. I travel (airplanes) with it weekly and thus far it has been flawless. Every evening when I get done with work I'm reminded how nice the keyboard on this thing is compared to my company issue Lenovo work laptop. No regrets, I'd still buy it at the current price...very few laptops can compete at this price range. Edit 11-26-19. Still the best at this price point. 1660ti is just the best for laptops balancing performance and battery.","After owning the last Helios 300 (GTX 1060) and selling it last year I was ready to be done with the Predator laptops.  The old red laptop was just too big and bulky, and between the thermal issues and instability with the OS I was just done with it altogether.  Then they released this Helios and I'm truly blown away. LOOKS- For starters it is a thinner, sleeker, lighter, and much more visually appealing laptop compared to the big red \"gamer\" aesthetic they were going for with the old model.  While performance matters more than looks to me and while it was a tremendous value for the price, it certainly drew a lot of attention for all the wrong reasons.  This one is a thinner, more modern looking computer with cleaner lines and a smaller profile while still keeping the same screen size.  The blue theme to this is more appealing VS the red and I use it for gaming as well as at work.  My colleagues presume it is a professional laptop but little do they know it is also a gaming powerhouse. PERFORMANCE- The 1660ti is only 7% weaker than my GTX 1070 that is in my PC tower.  It will play pretty much anything at 1080p ultra settings with fantastic frame rates.  Combined with the 144hz screen it is only trumped by my 4K monitor on my actual battlestation at home.  You can look up benchmarks if you're interested, but bottom line here is you'll have no problem with 1080p gaming.  If you want to do 4k you can output to an external monitor.  But that isn't the point of using a laptop. KEYBOARD- It's also an improvement over the previous Helios 300.  It's no mechanical keyboard but it is definitely responsive and comfortable to type on.  The inclusion of a numpad is also a plus SCREEN- Crystal clear with a high refresh rate.  By far the best I've seen on any laptop.  Mine didn't have any screen bleed but I can't speak for everyone.  Good size and the colors are nice and clear. BATTERY- It's simply OK.  You're gonna have better GPU performance with this plugged in but I can see general tasks being done on this for maybe a few hours before it needs to be plugged in. STORAGE- The 256GB drive is an M.2 drive and is crazy fast, but it doesn't hold a lot.  You can add another M.2 drive and there is a bay to add another Hard drive or SSD.  You'll have to actually wire the drive into your motherboard (the old Helios had the port pre-installed) and this is a service that could actually void your warranty.  It isn't the hardest thing to do, but I would definitely recommend taking it to an Acer care center if you can't figure it out. FINAL THOUGHTS- The new Predator Helios 300 is worth every penny.  With improved stability, thermals, looks and performance it is a no brainer.  This thing is gonna be the replacement for my PC tower if and or when it finally kicks the bucket.  If you held off on buying the last Predator due to all the issues you heard about I would say you made the right call.  This is the solution to those problems you were waiting for and then some.   If you're on the fence I can wholeheartedly say (with my name on the line) that this laptop is absolutely worth it.  Yeah it's expensive and I wasn't too thrilled about shelling out for another Predator after all the problems with the first one, but I am glad I got this and I know you'll be too.","The Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52 laptop with the Intel i7-9750h & nVidia 1660 Ti is a great performer. I've been using it as my daily work laptop with some occasional gaming for about a month. It replaced my Dell e6430. - It runs the latest games at above 60 fps with settings on high (generally speaking), usually much higher. PUBG runs at 95 - 105fps (non turbo), to 110 - 125fps (turbo) - 1080p, high settings. - The screen is excellent, 144hz IPS, and also works really well for Lightroom photo work. There is slight flex on open and close, I wish it was more ridged. It uses a metal lid and features the predator logo that is lit light blue at all times and cannot be turned off. - The keyboard feels decent for a chiclet keyboard, the keys have a positive activation feeling, are quiet, but feel slightly soft on bottom out. The back light can be turned off, but the 30 sec auto off setting cannot be adjusted. This version does not have and RGB back lighting, it's a light blue back light only. The keyboard deck, palm rest, and sides of the laptop are all one metal piece, there is no flex on the keyboard, which is excellent. - The touch pad feels really smooth, but the right\/left click button areas require more pressure to activate. - Wireless card is a Killer Wireless 802.11ac i1550 (Intel 9560NGW) - Links at 866Mbps - I've not had any drop-outs or disconnects. Mainly used with Cisco APs and Asus RT3200-AC at home. - Ethernet jack is very difficult to disengage the CAT5 cable from, it seems to snag on the RJ45 connector. Luckily I don't need to use wired ethernet too often. - The web cam and mic combo are pretty standard and of average picture and sound quality. They work fine for the occasional Skype call. - The the model I got came with a 256GB M.2. 2880 SATA SSD B+M key (Kingston RBUSNS8154P3256GJ1) - Also came with 16GB RAM - 2 x 8GB Kingston ACR26D4S9S8ME-8 PC-21300 DDR4 \/ DDR4-2666 (1333Mhz) - 19-19-19-43 timings. - It's very easy to remove the bottom panel to gain access to an additional M.2 slot and SATA 2.5\" storage bay, both RAM slots, and WiFi mini PCIe card. - The built in speakers produce pretty nice sound, they don't get as loud as I'd like them to be, but are perfectly adequate. - The fans are generally quite, when the system is used for web or light work, the CPU fan is slightly audible. During gaming they ramp up and get louder, and with turbo enabled, they get really loud, like a mini jet, and would be a definite annoyance for those around you. Head phones are recommend. I use turbo mode in PUBG, and it boosts frames anywhere from 10 to 15 extra fps. - The WASD area and palm rest don't get hot during gaming, just a little warm. The area above the keyboard and the num pad areas are where it gets hot. - On battery, I run the laptop in battery saver mode, and get about 4 hours, that's enough for a movie during a flight or several meetings of note taking \/ email \/ web. - While gaming I've noticed the battery will tick down while still on AC. I don't know yet if this is an issue. Searching around the web I've found reports that MSI and ASUS laptops do this too and it is by design; supposedly. During the course of a 3 hour gaming session in PUBG and turbo on, my battery drained to 75%. The drain is slower without turbo. I assume after the battery gets low enough, the CPU and GPU will throttle. I plan to reach out to ACER support for the official explanation. - I've picked up a spare AC adapter - included in photo, search Amazon for: 19.5V 9.23A AC Adapter Charger Power Supply for Acer Predator Helios 300 G3-571-77QK, G3-571 G3-572 PH317-51, Acer Aspire V17 Nitro VN7-793G, V15 Nitro VN7-593G Tip 5.5mm, Not Big Tip 7.4mm with Pin - It also fits nicely into Swiss Backpack - J14B-1H-A - 18.5 *12.5*7 (inches) So far I'm very happy with the laptop, it has excellent performance, very nice expandability, is comfortable to use and looks really good.","So I'll start with the fact that this laptop came with undervolted cpu which I found kinda strange. Played PUBG on ultra settings, max cpu temps were ~80\u00b0C and gpu max temps were 70\u00b0C (max fans on both).","I did a ton of research before landing on this laptop. I looked at Alienware, Razer and other brands but this one stood out the most. The amount performance for your hard earned money can\u2019t be beat. Pair that with great build quality and cooling, this laptop hits all marks. I use this primarily with my Oculus Rift S and it\u2019s able to run every game so far. For any one on the fence, I highly recommended this laptop. I also bought a 4-year warranty to hang onto this as long as possible without any worries.","What I like: The hinge feels amazing The overall performance The portability, it is light and the metal behind the screen helps with the feel of it. The screen refresh rate What I don't like: Just about everything else. I cant run any overclock at all on the GPU (through acers own software) without the drivers crashing (also on auto fans). Then if you dare even think about hitting the turbo button the fans go right to 100% and if you don't have noise canceling headphones\/headset then you find yourself not being able to hear the game unless you turn it up high enough to drown out the fans. Terrible thermal design as it gives up surface area and has to compensate with stupidly loud fans, it really should be a 17 inch with another heat pipe for both the cpu and gpu or at the very least more dense (or just larger) heat sinks. I've found the keyboard will double some letters, I don't know if that is a fault of the switches they use or what but It never happened on my old Asus rog laptop so that adds a bit to the lack of thought that went into this laptoop. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with this obnoxiously loud laptop but I might have to put it in another room and stream from it.","What I like most about the Predator laptop is the wide, clear and bright screen which is not only great for gaming, but for any visuals such as art, photo editing, watching videos, etc.  However, this is just one of the many features. The charging port is on the left side \u2013 I\u2019d have preferred it in back as to not have the cord looping around if the nearest power source is on the right. Also on the left side is a Kensington lock slot (sorry, have no idea what that is), an AC adapter jack, an ethernet port, two USB ports and the headphone jack. The right side has a USB Type-C port, a USB port that allows power-off charging, an external display port and a HDMI port. Speakers are angled to the rear on either side of the laptop base for stereo sound, which is crisp and clear. Both left and right sides as well as the back edge have multiple ventilation vents for the cooling fan. The underside also has an expansive ventilation area. The fan, though not loud, appears to be powerful as I did not experience any notable heating of the laptop components. The keyboard is brightly backlit with a bluish white light. At the top on the left side is the Turbo button, which allows you to switch the overclocking and fan level. There is also a \u201cPredatorSense\u201d key which launches the PredatorSense software by which you can monitor and change those settings as well as customizing your gaming profile. The camera window above the screen has a reasonably clear picture, and there are two internal stereo microphones on either side. The wide buttonless touchpad is quite sensitive, though you can modify this. I know that I may be old school in this but I do wish it had dedicated left and right-click buttons. Comes with Window 10 preloaded and with Cortana personal assistant.","The acer helios 300 2019 model one of the worst gaming laptop. I purchase the device on last July 21, 2019, I receive the product july 24 2019. It was fast delivery but at the same it the device was fast as well in malfunction, looping and freezing I can type in keys in search bar. Worst laptop ever, will never ever ordered here in amazon forever.","I've had this laptop for about 24 hours now and am seriously impressed with it. One thing I did have to do was to go into the nvidia control panel to set the Global Settings to use the nvidia 1660 graphics card. It defaults to the integrated graphics which is not as good as the nvidia card and why you are getting this laptop. I can only compare it to my only other Windows desktop which has the GTX1060 3G card from last year and this laptop is so much faster it is unreal. In one of my games I was getting over 100 FPS during FPP gameplay. Even over WiFi the laptop is responsive. The built in trackpad is okay.  You'll definitely want an external mouse. The included software like Predator Sense is particularly interesting as it provides the ability to overclock the GPU and easily. So far I haven't needed to but as far as having the software already preloaded is neat. Fan noise even without overclocking is noticeable but expected considering how much work this laptop is doing during game play. Audio through my bluetooth headset is really good. The Waves NX technology with my old bluetooth headset does make gameplay a lot better making it easier to hear which direction opponents are coming from. I'm seriously considering getting a NX enable headset to see how much better it could be. WiFi is solid and I'm connected to 5G for gameplay. I've also ordered a PCIe NVMe M.2 module to expand the drive space. The stock NVMe had about 190G available on it so still plenty of space but it is nice being able to expand with the extra empty M.2 slot.","This laptop is a beast. I literally haven't found a game in which I can't run at max settings and still get an amazing frame rate. This is all without activating the \"Turbo\" setting which automatically over-clocks everything on your laptop, and cranks up the fans to max speed to keep them cool. This laptop is very sturdily made, and the backlit keyboard is a great addition, although you can not change the colors in this model. Cooling System- The fans and the design do a great job at keeping this beast of a laptop cool, allowing amazing ventilation that blows out the back of the computer. They can get a little loud when running in the above mentioned \"Turbo\" mode. Screen- Great looking screen. I have no issues about the screen. ---Con--- I only have one bad thing to say about this laptop, this being it only has one hard-drive, and it's a measly 256 GB in size. Granted it is a Solid State Hard-Drive that is lightening fast, I do like more storage space, so I purchased a WD 1TB hard-drive to go into the empty additional hard-drive bay. Bottom Line- This is a great laptop, very fast, and reliable. If you're a gamer, or need to run any CPU\/GPU intensive software this will not let you down. I highly recommend this beast of a machine.","All I have to say with this laptop is just wow. Acer has really delivered with this laptop for 2019. Just a quick story, I\u2019m upgrading from a 17\u2019 2014 Asus G751JT that has a GTX970m 3GB, Intel i7 4c\/8t 4710hq 2.5ghz\/3.5ghz boost, 60hz IPS screen that was $1500 and is 8.6lbs. As a college student, my tolerance for lugging that thing has been getting lower over the years. Also had some infamous battery problems that were annoying. I needed a good overall laptop to fulfill my gaming and study needs as I commute an hour to my university and stay there most of the day.  It\u2019s amazing on how far gaming laptops have gone within the last 5 years. Luckily, I was able to buy this laptop on prime day for $1000 which sold out hours after it got discounted. That speaks volume of how fantastic this laptop is. This won\u2019t be a full-fledged nitty gritty review, so I\u2019ll just stick to my opinions and findings on the product. The laptop feels premium. I\u2019m amazed with the build quality at this price point along with the weight. It\u2019s an eye catcher as I enjoyed looking at this laptop when I first unboxed it. The keyboard is pretty solid as it didn\u2019t take long for me to get used to typing it. To be fair, I have smaller than average hands so your mileage will vary on this. It\u2019s comfortable to type on for me, and I enjoy the sky-blue backlight as I\u2019ve been stuck on red for 5 years. No complaints on the trackpad. It\u2019s a little rough, I wish there were actual physical buttons for right and left click but I mostly stick to my USB mouse. The screen is 144hz and it is BRIGHT. The colors look great and the buttery smooth screen is just an awesome upgrade for me. There is some backlight bleed, but I only notice it on startup and loading screens. I do not notice it during gameplay unless you are playing a game with dark settings. The screen is so good for the price that I am willing to forgive some minor backlight bleed. If this was a $1600+ laptop, then I\u2019d have a serious problem with it. Internet speed is good, no complaints. This laptop comes standard with 2x8gb of ram. Although I might upgrade to 2x16gb of ram down the road if I need to for my Information Technology classes. One thing to note is you definitely need to upgrade the storage in the laptop. You have space for a 2.5 drive and another NVMe ssd.  I\u2019m definitely going to get a 2tb sshd when I have the spare funds; which thankfully Acer provided a kit for a 2.5 drive for your convenience. A 1tb WD Blue is a good m.2 drive to get for storage if you need some fast speeds for any applications that benefit from it like Photoshop or VMware. Now for gaming, I\u2019ll throw in a couple games. The Witcher 3 runs between 70-80fps on ultra-settings. Deus Ex: Mankind Divided was anywhere between 55-70fps on ultra. And for fun, I threw in Rocket League and it maxed out with spare performance to boot. Threw in a heavily modded Fallout New Vegas with 30+ mods and it ran beautifully. Battlefield 4 was a pretty awesome experience too.  Overall, this laptop will handle most, if not, all your gaming needs. What\u2019s great is that I never reached above 75c on the GPU and 80c on the cpu without touching anything on the laptop (Auto fans, no overclocking). The fans are somewhat audible; they never got as loud as turning on the turbo button which is just overkill imo. I usually keep fan speeds at around 85%. Keep in mind, my room temperature was 76F. I definitely don\u2019t recommend any heavy gaming in a quiet place like the library, but if you are then you\u2019re not doing your studying like you should be. Look up a YouTuber named OwnOrDisown. He reviewed the laptop and configured the laptop settings to get a nice middle ground for extra performance. Battery life is anywhere from 3.5 \u2013 5 hours depending on your usage. This is with 20% brightness, max keyboard backlight brightness, and some YouTube in the background while typing up this review on Microsoft word. It\u2019s not a long battery life like some ultra-books, but the battery is enough for me to get through some classes before I have to charge which is fine. I don\u2019t recommend gaming on battery unless it\u2019s a low intensity game like Rimworld, Stardew Valley, or AoEII. Seriously, don\u2019t expect any gaming laptop to run AAA titles at max settings and max performance on battery. It\u2019s unreasonable. One minor annoyance I had was the sound. Apparently, the laptop comes with Acer TrueHarmony that modifies sound by default. If you are hearing an echo-like sound as I was, then I\u2019ll save you the 30 minutes. Open the PredatorSense interface and click on the App Center tab. Open Waves MaxxAudio. Click on the Waves Nx tab and disable the feature. Viola, the echo is gone. You can go back to the MaxxAudio tab and configure the sound properly to your liking. Closing Thoughts: This laptop is a breath of fresh air for me. I was extremely lucky on getting it for $1000. It does so many things right that I\u2019d say it\u2019d warrant the full price (Which is currently $1200 as of the time of writing..or typing? Whatever.) and I\u2019d be ok with it. If you\u2019re considering on getting a laptop, this is one of the few I\u2019d heavily recommend because of the price point. (Other brands, please take notes).","The good. - Games run smoothly. - Battery life is around average in comparison to other gaming laptops of similar price. - Keyboard works well and is comfortable. - Software for controlling fans and gpu overclocking is good, even though it is oversimplified. - Design is very aggressive and futuristic. (In my opinion) - Specs are great for the price. - Keyboard illumination is better than most laptops. - 144hz is perfect for fps shooters as long as you optimize your settings accordingly. - Color balance seems to be pretty good out-of-the-box. - HDD installation is super easy. The bad. - Fans are really loud. When I say loud, I mean Airplane loud. When you hit \"turbo mode,\" get ready for lift-off. - Keyboard layout is not very good. Look it up and judge it for yourself. Having keys moved from their original position is never good IMHO. Num lock is moved to make room for a dedicated key for the Predator software (completely useless if you ask me) shifting all keys that follow. I. E. \"\/\", \"*\", \"-\", \"+\". - This laptop is useless if you don't buy an 2.5\" HDD. Don't think you will be able to manage it. Games nowadays are 70GB+, that is, high end games. Yet if you want a gaming laptop, you probably want to play those games. The UGLY. -  The IPS panel on this machine (which is known for having backlight bleed, or simply put, light spots around the corners) is very fragile. After looking it up, it seems like many many people complain about this problem. To make matters worse, the laptop lid is BENDY, which causes the display to perform even worse. It is made of plastic that feels very cheap. In contrast, the frame around the keyboard is metallic and solid. So, whenever you are watching a movie taking place in a dark setting or nighttime you CAN'T  AVOID seeing white areas. Very annoying. If this is important to you, don't buy it. And if you want to move it around and take it with you a lot, don't buy it either. Chances are that one small bump and you can kiss your IPS panel goodbye.","Vents blowing air directly to the charging cable on the left and to your mouse hand on he right.... Two units I received, two units with back light bleed Keys are super shallow Lots of bloatware","Product did not work out of the box.  Tech support told me to reset the computer finding a pin hole, that did not exist.  I was then told to send the computer to them and it would be gone for weeks.  Computer did charge, but would not boot up.  I have never had a computer not turn on when it is brand new.  I decided not to waste time and just send it back to amazon and not stray from Lenovo again.","A few weeks ago I got my first gaming laptop that had an i7 8750 & GTX 1060 3gb card for $799. It was the HP gaming laptop & for the specs it was a great deal I thought until I actually tried to game on it. It had heating issues with maxes of 97c after only 30 mins & throttling everything. Undervolt did nothing. One day I saw an ad for this laptop while browsing & I decided to check it out. After two reviews I sent the HP back as fast as possible. I've had this laptop for a week now and have had no issues. I can play everything in my library on Ultra with temps only ever hitting 85 without the fan even being on max. Fan controls are amazing, wifi card & Ethernet work great, the screen looks beautiful sporting 144hz with 3ms & it even comes with Display Port that supports 240hz w\/GSync. Got a extended warranty with this thing & I'm so glad I did. One thing to note is that the fans are loud when turned up but with the temps I get I just throw on my headset & couldn't be bothered. Only cons I can really thing of is the low starting storage, the slight bloatware you get with it and there's a bit of backlight bleed but whatever, so far it was a great buy for me.","Simply put, this thing is great especially at the $928 black Friday 2019 price I paid. Good mix of portability, versatility, gaming, without going too far in either direction (being so thin and light that it can't game, being so powerful that it can't be portable). This is a great middle ground, and an amazing price. I'll now break my review down into different sections. Screen: 144Hz is becoming the norm for gaming laptops, including budget ones. For me, the response time is what makes this screen feel great. The 3ms response time is published prominently on the listing because most gaming laptops have response times at least twice that, and I can tell the difference going from my 144hz 9ms 17\" laptop I previously used. Same refresh rate, different response \"feel\". It's noticeable faster on the Helios. It isn't color-calibrated or anything, and according to experts the colors are just mediocre. To my simple gamer eyes, colors pop and games look great. So it does what it needs to! Gaming: The i7-9750H is the standard for this generation of gaming laptops, and it's just a refresh of the 8750H. 100Mhz faster, it's basically the same. Not too much to discuss about it other than the thermals which I'll discuss more later. The GPU is the new GTX 1660TI. This is why the Helios is relatively \"cheap\" compared to some laptops touting an RTX 2080. Honestly, I've used very powerful gaming laptops, and they do not feel faster. Unless you're going home and hooking the laptop up to a 4k monitor, which you should have a powerful gaming desktop for anyway, you don't need more performance than this. Even with a RTX 2060, the GPU doesn't reach full utilization because the mobile version of Intel's CPUs cannot keep up with the GPU performance. With a 1660ti, you get high settings in games, with over 70-80fps (AAA games), and it's being fully used, so you know that your investment is being put to good use. Keyboard: Acer did an amazing job of mixing a great feel for both typing and gaming. I have not owned the machine for long, but have reached my full typing speed very quickly. Just mushy enough to be comfortable in gaming, but tactile enough for typing to be a breeze and enjoyable. Mousepad: Great for a gaming laptop. The use of Microsoft precision drivers makes it very accurate, and I have been happy with the feel. Click-and-drag functions are easy to do, not something I can say for all laptops. Aesthetics and build quality: The aesthetic is now a blue, not the familiar red that the Helios line has used before. Some non-Amazon models have RGB keyboards, this one does not. I personally don't care, but it's there. In a way I do wish the logo on the back was smaller or less angular, but having my peers know that it's a gaming laptop doesn't really make a difference for me as a student. The build quality is great, and it feels like a quality machine. Yes, the bottom is plastic, but that's true for laptops costing over $2,000 as well. The parts that you touch such as the lid, and keyboard deck are metal, and have no flex in them. It feels like a machine costing hundreds more, evidenced by the fact that Acer uses the same chassis\/frame for models costing closer to $2,000. That speaks for itself. Portability: The laptop is relatively thin without compromising on the cooling performance. It is 5 lbs, and this again is good enough without giving up potential performance. The fact that it's 15\" and not 17\" also adds to the portability, if you're thinking about a 17\" and have to move your laptop often, don't do it. The power supply \"brick\" in the cord is also relatively small for the performance you're bringing around. I can carry the laptop with one hand easily, and in a backpack it feels like it isn't there. Battery life is shorter than an ultrabook, sure, but that's what you should expect. 3-4 hours is enough if you're a student in my opinion, and I rarely need to use my laptop when I'm not near a power plug. Thermals\/noise: Acer has done some serious engineering here. I have used ASUS, MSI, and even custom-made liquid metal applied laptops. I know what I'm talking about here. Any ASUS I've tried hits 95+ celsius on the CPU right away even in normal gaming, even with the fans all the way up. Seriously, they're horrible. MSI's that I have experience with are actually quite good at cooling, but they were also thicker than this machine. I most recently used a custom-made Eluktronics laptop with optional liquid metal applied for cooling (goes between the CPU and heatsink for maximum heat transfer). This laptop is actually most comparable to that one, and even is slightly better in some ways. Acer has seriously taken into account the thermal paste they use, the construction of the fanblades, and the necessary fan speeds, PLUS, the machine is undervolted from the factory. From stock settings, the CPU stays in the 80s, usually below 85. Given how Intel has not been able to get past their 14nm process, this is sadly a great result. If you use predator sense software and change the GPU overclock to fast or extreme, you get more performance, and louder fans, resulting in slightly lower temps, plus better framerates, going from 70-76 in my borderlands 3 benchmarking. I personally am a tinkerer, and enjoy messing with settings. I used throttlestop and undervolted the CPU more to -.150V, plus adding 15W to the chip's turbo boost power consumption, changing it from 45W to 60W, and changing the turbo boost time window from  28 seconds up to 40. Even with adding a lot of power to the chip, my CPU stays 77-80 now, with a maximum of 81 in games. This is even with the Acer software set to extreme overclocking, and with the fans in their stock overclocked setting. All summed up, as someone who knows a lot about laptops, desktops, and their cooling issues, this is hands-down an amazing feat. Acer is the only manufacturer in the game right now that cares at all about thermals it appears. The changes they've done with the thermal paste, fanblade design, and undervolting is a GREAT innovation. Altogether, this is an amazing laptop. I'd recommend it to anyone looking in the price range, and even those looking closer to the $2,000 price mark, as the 1660ti GPU is really all you need for a gaming laptop, they almost always have 1080p screens anyway. I'm happy I got it on black friday, but it's well worth the $1200 regular price as well. A last note is storage. The laptop only ccomes with 256gb SSD storage. The included SSD is actually NVMe, and extremely fast. Just plan on getting an additional 1tb slower ssd, or even a hdd if you're desperate. Acer has two extra mounting options included, with hardware provided. You can add a 2280 M.2 SSD, or a 2.5\" SSD. You can total have 3 drives in the machine, and that's amazing for a 15\" option. Upgrading is very simple, just need a philips screwdriver, and there's many videos online of how to open this laptop.","All good and fine but I am disappointed with the white visible shades of light on a black image... It's clear the display could suffer improvements in matter of backlighting ... Too bad, I didn't have this issue on my last old laptop, but I've seen this issue presented on some reviews on YouTube.. so I'm pretty sure this is common.. what can I say, still a greate laptop for gaming at a good price...","If you're looking for a laptop that is a drop-in replacement for a desktop, then this is probably not your device. It doesn't have the super-premium GPU, and it doesn't have a Displayport capable of driving external monitors at high refresh rates. It doesn't do G-SYNC or Freesync, although it may be able to do high refresh rates over HDMI if your display supports it. No Thunderbolt or USB-C power delivery, etc. No SD card slot for photo mavens. There's no native method to drive more than 1 external display, and if you use a USB 3.0 dock or something you'd probably lose graphics acceleration. But at this price point there is no better travel laptop for gaming. Battery life is poor for gaming (as is always the case when driving an Intel CPU and NVIDIA GPU), but GPU performance on the internal screen is fantastic, and the discrete GPU is automatically turned off when not gaming to extended battery life. Internal storage is tight at 256GB but expansion options are abundant, with both 2.5\" drive slot and NVME slot available for immediate expansion.  Popping a 2.5\" SSD into the slot with the included ribbon cable and rubber bumper was easy-peasy.  Several USB 3.0 ports (3 USB A connectors and 1 USB C connector) provide ample external connectivity. The internal keyboard and touch pad are perfectly adequate, but you're gonna use a mouse + WASD anyway so who cares? Some folks worry about the AC adapter cable sitting next to the air vent, but it really doesn't get hot enough to do any harm. I suppose you could always get a little extension cable if it bothered you that much.","I bought this laptop to replace an old Inspiron 7559, and I can tell you, it's night and day difference! The build quality is excellent, it has aluminum on the lid and rest palm, while the bottom is plastic. The screen is 144hz IPS, let me tell you, coming from the inspiron 7559 the difference is abismal! you can really notice the 144hz response time. The keyboard is very sturdy and backlit, it has three levels of brightness and has no flex at all, it feels nice and has a good travel. The touchpad is very responsive and uses Microsoft Precision Drivers (which helps). The performance is awesome, having an i7 9750h with 16GB of RAM really makes this laptop fly. I am a software developer and the Nvme included is very fast for such things. The computer can be easily upgraded removing the bottom lid (9 or 10 philips screws), you can add a 2.5 HDD or SSD, another NVME M2 drive or 32GB of RAM, which will make this laptop last a life. Thermals are good, because Acer undervolts the CPU out of the box by -125mV and the completely redesigned cooling system (vs Helios 300 2018) makes this laptop a winner in this section, however, you can reach thermal throttling when having extended sessions of gameplay in a warm environment. I was having this \"problem\" (not really a problem) but putting the laptop on a cooling pad solved this. Battery life is average, I managed about 3 and a half hours using this laptop for developing on Android Studio with a virtual device running all the time. All in all, I strongly recommend this laptop, Acer really did a great job on this, making an excellent computer for the price, great components (i7 9750h, GTX 1660 Ti) and great performance, great keyboard, great screen, average battery life, excellent build quality. Recommended!!","Bricked...won't power on at all.  Requested an exchange,  however; reading below it seems it won't go through that way.  I spoke with Amazon chat who says it will go through so I'm confused.  Either way it was great while it worked.  I tried a soft reset of the battery,  there is no hard reset of the battery.  I see the light for charging light up,  but the power button does nothing anymore....I'll change to a higher review if the new one lasts longer than 3 days...","The new model Helios 300 is a vast improvement over its predecessor, which was a steaming pile of hot garbage. However, some smart people over at Acer decided to fix things, and the result is an excellent laptop at an unbeatable price point. Let's break it down: Looks: Okay, lets get it out of the way. The Decepticon logo and PREDATOR logo across the back aren't exactly appealing. The rest of the laptop is a nice understated black, however, which I appreciate. Keyboard\/Touchpad: Nothing special here. The keyboard is serviceable, but not spectacular, the touchpad is a touchpad. Nothing fancy. Performance: Here's where we get to the good stuff. Any other laptop with these same specs is either more expensive, or throttles because it can't cool adequately. The Helios 300, however, has a newly redesigned cooling system that handles gaming without overheating or throttling (tested on Aida64 and Heaven benchmarks). You also get a Full HD 144hz screen. No GSync, but you can't have everything, I suppose. Overall, the price to performance ratio on this laptop is pretty much unbeatable.  Anything else with the same specs either overheats and throttles (Dell, HP, Asus) or is more expensive (Razer, MSI, Lenovo). Acer manages to hit that perfect sweet spot. Sure, there are laptops out there that might have a screen a bit nicer, be a bit lighter, game a bit faster, and so on, but the Helios 300 seems to get everything at that \"just right\" level. For the same price point, nothing else compares.","I have spent around 6 months looking at computers and trying to find something good for me that will last at least 3 years, after I did my research and looked at every laptop on the market that is around 1000$ that is good for the money, then this Helios 300 came out recently  although I was about to get the older one... now after 2 weeks of using this laptop, I can summarize  my experience with this device: -First of all the device is really a predator and the performance is really good, it looks very good, well built... very fast, it can run almost everything above 60 frames on ultra settings. the temperature can reach above 90 if you are not using max speed fan,  I didn't like that at all because it is very loud, even keys get very hot. -The keyboard is fine, but someone here said that his keyboard broke, and I believe that! they don't seem very durable, that's why I am using a joystick to play my games. -The battery is fine, can last around 4 hours if you are watching a movie. - The storage is small that's why you have to buy extra storage. - Speakers are good. - It catches a lot of fingerprints, which I don't like that but it is fine. - the worst thing about this laptop is the screen the backlight bleeding in this device is really pain in the ass, the laptop I got has one on the top and on the right edges, and it really irritates me whenever I see it, I am horror games fan so most of my games are in the dark.. like seriously how a company like Acer can make such laptop with such defective screen, they should remove all their laptops from the market and build it well, I am really pissed off about the screen and I am not happy about it.. it looks great if there is no black color, even in the daylight you hardly notice the backlight bleeding, but who is gonna play in the morning all the time.. My problem is that I am outside the US, this laptop was brought to me from the US to Turkey by a friend of mine, and I would really love to replace this device and get something different. I am sorry Acer, my first impression about you is really bad now unless I get a replacement for this device, I will contact the support team in Turkey to see if they can help me =\/","Estoy muy decepcionado con el producto. Estuve meses buscando un notebook o computador de escritorio que satisfaga mis necesidades y que tenga un precio atractivo, hasta que me encontr\u00e9 con Acer Predator Helios 300 modelo 2019. 8 La verdad que en el papel tiene unas grandiosas caracter\u00edsticas. Un procesador de \u00faltima generaci\u00f3n (i7 9na generaci\u00f3n) y una excelente tarjeta de video a nivel de rendimiento (nvidia 1660ti). La verdad es que al parecer este computador tiene serios problemas de manufacturaci\u00f3n. Invert\u00ed bastante en un notebook que fallo al segundo d\u00eda de uso, corr\u00ed el riesgo ignorando los comentarios negativos y esperando que solo sea un caso aislado hasta que lleg\u00f3 mi maquina y fu\u00ed una v\u00edctima m\u00e1s de la mala manufactura del producto.  Env\u00ede el notebook al servicio internacional de Acer en mi pa\u00eds y el resultado es una falla y necesidad de reemplazo en la placa madre. A pesar de que est\u00e1 en proceso de arreglo no se cual ser\u00e1 el resultado de esta historia, si finalmente mi computador lograr\u00e1 estar como uno nuevo o sera un arreglo que no este a la altura de la maquina que compre. Todo esto mientras corre el tiempo de devoluci\u00f3n de mi dinero si no quedo conforme, no se si lo arreglar\u00e1n a tiempo. Ped\u00ed el notebook un 5 de diciembre en un env\u00edo que pague para que llegara m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido y tardo casi un mes en llegar. luego falla al segundo d\u00eda de uso y llevo m\u00e1s de 2 semanas esperando la reparaci\u00f3n. Me han hecho pasar un gran estr\u00e9s no sabiendo lo que pasar\u00e1 con una inversi\u00f3n grande para m\u00ed (1400 dolares el valor junto con impuestos y env\u00edo) y yo solo quer\u00eda una maquina buena. Realmente lamentable la experiencia que recibo tanto de Amazon como de Acer con un producto nuevo que debiese estar  en perfectas condiciones, sobre todo si es tu primera compra en el sitio. Enviarlo de vuelta solo me devuelven 20 d\u00f3lares del costo de casi 200 d\u00f3lares que me cuesta volver mi producto fallado. Espero que esta historia de terror pronto se solucione.","After doing tons of Research, I finally decided on a $\/value metric that the 2019 Predator Helios 300 (the blue trimmed one is 2019), was the best option (esp, when It was on sale for $999$). Comparable to 1300-1700 gaming laptops. And after opening it up and playing games like RDR2, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Rainbow Six Siege, And even Apex Legends (all on high\/ultra settings) - it\u2019s a beautiful and Smooth experience. Very happy. But there\u2019s one downside Of which I make A recommendation to adjust: the 256gb (Hard drive ) storage) just is to small. That\u2019s the big downside with this laptop, that\u2019s not enough room for much games (EX: RDR2 took up >140gb space  alone). Thus what I did immediately after buying was purchase a 1TB SSD 2.5 (Samsung Evo - roughly $150 I paid), And installed it (pretty easy after watching instructions on YouTube for this helio 300 model - but DO NOT attempt to do so unless you\u2019re prepared to void warranty - i.e. unscrewing the laptop bottom I believe voids warranty, that\u2019s What I  read, but not fully sure, so beware). Adding the 1TB SSD gives me significant storage space for my games + much faster Laptop performance (faster bootup, faster game load times, etc). Thus in my opinion, the 2019 Helios 300 + adding 1TB SSD is an amazing purchase and I\u2019m very much enjoying it. Will update of anything changes.","I have had this laptop for almost 3 weeks and have been putting it through its paces with general use, games, watching streaming videos, etc. before writing this review. ======= Pros: ======= * Cooling is MUCH improved over the 2018 PH315-51 model and comes factory under-volt by -0.125v which certainly helps. * The screen bezel is a lot thinner than the older models. The screen just feels bigger now even though logically, on paper, a 15.6\" screen is a 15.6\" screen. * Has a DisplayPort * All USB ports are USB 3.0 (Instead of 2x 2.0 and 1x 3.0 as on the older model) * Gaming performance is great * Overall performance is great * Boot time is insanely fast on the NVME drive. Around 10 seconds or so, if that. * Screen is beautiful, colors are vibrant, the view angle is fantastic, and the 144 HZ refresh rate is great; although please see my gripe about discoloration of the top of the screen in the Cons section. * The touch pad is nice and spacious * It is pretty light as far as gaming laptops go. I've seen some people complain that this laptop is heavy; but coming from an older gaming laptop that weighed almost 15 pounds... The weight of this laptop is a major relief! * The keys are back-lit which is great for low-light\/night time computing\/gaming * The chassis is nice. The top (back of the screen) and the keyboard area is metal, while the bottom and the bezel surrounding the screen is durable plastic. I absolutely love how nice and cool the metal is against my wrists when I'm typing. ======= Cons: ======= * My biggest gripe about this laptop is that there is visible light\/color distortion at the top of the screen that is very noticeable against dark backgrounds. This is very distracting if you're watching a movie and there's dark scenes, or if you like to play horror games where typically the environment is dark. I've noticed a lot of people calling this light bleed and I've seen multiple screenshots of the effect; but this isn't light bleed (Well, it might be in the technical sense of the word). You know how if you press your finger lightly against an LCD screen (I'm NOT recommending that you do this by the way), it discolors slightly around the area where you touched? That is what's happening here. Apparently the bezel at the top of the screen is pressing WAY too freaking tight against the top of the screen (From factory!) and causing the discoloration at the top of the screen. I can't imagine that this is good for the health of the screen. This NEEDS to be fixed. * NVME drive is small at 256 GB. There is 237 GB usable, but realistically, there is less than that due to operating system install, so there is more around 130 - 150 GB of free space for applications, games, etc. You can load a handful of modest sized games or one huge game (Doom 2016 is around 80 - 100 gigs after patches and Final Fantasy XV is around 90 gigs after patches. Sheesh, game sizes are getting absolutely ridiculous!). That little drive will be hurting for free space in no time at all after a few games are installed. You will definitely want to add a spare drive to put games on. Acer claims that the laptop is expandable with a second NVME drive and a 2.5 inch bay (Which does include the connector you need for it in the package), but the entire back has to come off if you want to put a drive in internally, and you might void the warranty in the process if you do it yourself; so it's not a false claim, but it's a 'gotcha' claim. An external USB drive is the way to go if you want to remain on the safe side and don't want to pay a tech to put a drive in for you. * Battery life is OK; not great, but not bad either. When not gaming it can get about 3 - 4 hours of light use. It is absolutely horrendous when gaming at approximately 50 minutes, give or take a few depending on the game. Although I will say that this is to be expected from a gaming laptop. It's a lot of power packed into a tiny device. You will definitely want to be plugged in if you want to game on it for any extended length of time. * The webcam is horrible. It is -technically- HD in resolution, but only in resolution. The picture quality resembles early 2000s webcams. The video quality is something between a VHS recording and low quality grainy DVD. You'll either want to get an external webcam or pass this laptop up for a different one because this webcam sorely disappoints. It will work in a pinch though. I will note that it helps a bit to have a very well lit room if you want to use the webcam; even so, it's still pretty bad in my opinion. In the end it doesn't matter to me personally since I don't use webcam that often anyway. * The sound quality of the microphone is not fantastic. It sounds like someone is talking through a tin can. Like the webcam though, It will work in a pinch. I don't use microphones that much anyway, so it isn't a big deal for me. * The speakers sound piercing and tinny. No bass whatsoever. This is to be expected though, most laptops don't have the greatest speakers anyway. Use headphones or an external speaker system whether wired or blue tooth. * Acer seems bent on making installing your own OS on this laptop as hard as possible; even if you want to install a different edition of Windows 10 (For example: It comes with Windows 10 Home but you want to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro). It is doable but be prepared to do a little digging and research to figure out how to do it. I would expect this kind of crap on a low end cheap laptop, but NOT on an expensive gaming laptop! * UEFI\/BIOS settings are bare minimal. You can tweak a few boot settings and that is about it. It is definitely NOT a power user's utility. Again, I expect this on a low end laptop, not a gaming laptop. ============================================= Mixed Feelings that are neither Pro nor Con for me: ============================================= * Although cooling is much improved over last year's model, for some games, you will want to turn the fan to max. Keep an eye on PredatorSense temps. I personally prefer to max the fans if I notice the temps getting higher than about 75, but that's just me. * There is a very limited amount of USB ports if you're not counting the USB-C connector, there are 3x USB 3.0 ports. Invest in a powered USB hub if you need to plug in more than just a keyboard and mouse (Because who wants to game on a laptop keyboard and touch pad unless they had no choice?) * USB-C connector is data only; does not output video * There is no optical disc drive. Not a big deal since USB drives are cheap nowadays, but it would have been nice to have. * The touch pad doesn't seem to have the capability to scroll window contents like a lot of laptops have on the side of the touch pad that I can tell. You will be making good friends with the Up, Down, Page Up, and Page Down keys if you don't want to use the scroll bars in your window(s) and don't have an external mouse hooked up. * You have to be slightly heavy handed on the touch pad but this may come down to user preference. Personally I'm fine with it and I'll be hooking an external mouse to it whenever possible anyway. * Keyboard back lights are not RGB. They are solid blue\/light blue in color, you can toggle them on or off, and set a few different levels of brightness on them. Not a big deal for me though; I'm just happy being able to see the keyboard in the dark. * There is pretty minimal bloatware pre-installed, but it is no where near as bad as other computer brands. I would consider it a reasonable amount to be honest. * The dual GPU set up can be confusing at first. A tip for anyone first time to dual GPU: If you're having trouble figuring out why some applications are performing badly and they don't seem to be using the nVidia GPU; close the program, then right click it, and chose Run application with GPU > High performance nVidia. You can also set up an application profile in the nVidia control panel for your program to use which ever GPU you want if you want the program to always run with that. Despite some faults with this laptop, overall, I like this laptop a lot.","This laptop is amazing, I can't describe it in few words this will take a lot of time to and I want to write a short review as much as I can. So I got this laptop on the gamer's day deal for 1000$ and that is a great value for me since I was looking for this laptop since 2018, my previous laptop was MSI GL62M, and I sell it when I got my new Acer Predator Helios 300, it have more RAM, stronger CPU, GPU and much powerful gaming screen with 144Hz. I have few notes over all my use in the last 3 weeks since I got it, the laptop makes an echo when I take the charger out while I wear my headphones and that's a little bit annoying and when you pull the charger out it makes a sound and I don't like it as well, the screen is perfect, but before I purchase this laptop people kept saying that there is a screen bleed on the top of the screen, and that is not a screen bleed at all, it from the manufacturer, since it is pressing so hard on the top side of the screen and that what make the white color showing, but in my case this not annoying at all, and I don't notice it at all and I am really happy with it. another thing that the charger place is different than any other laptop I use in my life which is on the middle left side of the laptop and that's a kinda annoying me as well, also one time I was playing games and the predator sense was working on background and I wanted to use the max fans speed ( which are really loud when they are on ) it didn't work and I had to close it and launch it again and it worked. Turbo button works well and the installation of the HDD was very easy and works perfect ( I bought a Seagate firecuda 2TB from amazon on a deal for 65$ only and this SSHD works really well - also I install it with Justech screwdriver which is also from amazon ). I recommend who buy this laptop to get a cooling pad with it because it get really hot when playing high FPS games like PUBG, Fortnite, overwatch and other games, because it will help lowing down the temperature so much. Final review: The material that used to build this laptop is really good, blue color that added to this years model is just insane and beautiful, you can open the laptop with one finger easily, but what annoys me that fingerprints are staying and you have to clean them daily if you want to keep you laptop clean. Screen is good for me even with the white pressure on the middle top screen on and sometimes I don't even notice it. GPU and CPU are just amazing for this price point and they work perfectly with no problems at all, just watch out for the temperature. keyboard is well built and I have no problems typing on it and im writing this review while using the laptop keyboard, also the blue back-lit looks amazing at night when the lights around you are off, I really like it. track-pad is really annoying as well, you feel like your fingers are sticking when ever you move around, I recommend every one to get a mouse to avoid using it, this the most part that I didn't like about this laptop. sound feels amazing on this laptop, and I can hear my favorite music on it and listen to video's without any problem at all, It feels nice to listen to favorite stuff on this laptop Audio with this phenomenal quality. Battery gives me around 4 hours while I don't play, just watching movies and browsing and it last for long time, but when I am playing games it gives me around 1:00 to 1:30 hours at max while gaming. webcam is coming at 720p30 which is not that much and If you a kind of person that use laptop for streaming and video calling and you want who watch you in a better picture you may want to get a better external webcam. The advertising of this laptop for the Killer Doubleshot Pro Wi-Fi card is not for nothing I really feel it is download stuff more faster than my previous laptop and I really like it. well done Acer. Storage comes with a kingstone 256GB PCIe M.2 drive is installed, It works perfectly and fast on day to day tasks and I really appreciate Acer for this SSD that they installed. Well thanks for continuing reading this article to the end, and I am sorry for making it so long as I say I will try to make it as shot as I can xD, I got excited and kept writing. thank you all and I hope for you a wonderful life. ^_^","I recently got a job that requires me to travel a lot. My wife and I are avid gamers so I needed to find a good quality gaming laptop. I am extremely satisfied with this laptop so far. It has really great build quality. The graphics card (1660ti) is perfect for 1080p high FPS gaming. I get over 100FPS with ultra settings in almost every game I play (Apex Legends, Rocket League, PUBG, and CSGO). I dropped some setting in shooter games and easily get over 144FPS. You can not ask for much more out a gaming laptop, and all for $1200. This laptop is getting the same, if not better, frame rates than far more expensive and 'higher end' laptops I looked into. I was also surprised by the \"Waves MaxxAudio\" software. I am a big music\/audio enthusiast. I never knew about this included software until I actually got the laptop. It is not amazing, but it is much better than I expected. If I run into any issues, I will update this review. So far though, I am very happy with my purchase. Buy this thing before Acer realizes that they could sell it for more.","I really do like the sleekness of it but I am also disappointed disappointed that I spent a grand and a half to have a battery that lasts maybe a hour or two when in portable mode I know it\u2019s good for the price and has all the specs you would want but it feels like another desktop I can\u2019t use it without having it plugged in and it definitely doesn\u2019t last no 6 hours it last 2 if I\u2019m lucky really disappointed like how can you make a laptop so good and overlook that people want to be able to game portably which I haven\u2019t tryed gaming but I thought oh 6 hours would be good I\u2019m only using fl studio it dies in a hour of usage really upset writing this review because I use to have a Acer laptop back in the day and I was so excited to get this brand new one only to find out it dies with minimal usage even just being on browser kills it another thing to add is that the storage the storage should come with 1tb like I rather have slower boot times then to have to have a external hard drive it\u2019s just frustrating because I love the specs and rgb lighting but the battery and storage make this laptop so annoying","This laptop's performace is unbelieveable. The battery life is respectable considering the strength of this machine. The SSD is fast, nothing to complain about really, but when it comes to the screen (in my case) it feels buttery smooth (144Hz is indeed a treat for gaming) but it has visible backlight bleed. I know it is common for IPS screens to suffer from ''bleeding'' but I feel like mine could be worse than in general. Sometimes the leaking is visible even during daytime when dark content is shown on the screen, especially on the top (under the camera) and top right corner of the display. I have been using this laptop for almost 2 weeks now, but this backlight bleed just keeps bothering me.  I'm thinking about replacing my unit, but I'm still not sure if it would be worth the trouble. Is this screen inperfection acceptable or should I try to apply for a replacement? If someone has some thoughts about this situation feel free to leave a comment, it would really help me out.","Looking for a laptop that can handle my Rift S games. and for causal screen tasks (gaming, video editing, browsing the web) Laptop is very nice, got it on sale too. Why did I end up returning it?  Probably because I\u2019m picky, but the model I had had a terrible screen bleed on the upper left corner of screen, while I could fix it. It\u2019s not my part to do so when I spend my hard earned money towards.  Other reason was because of the fan noise. While I understand it\u2019s in fact a gaming laptop. And I actually don\u2019t mind when it\u2019s spun up when gaming. I don\u2019t like that it it about as loud when on idle!  Yeah that\u2019s right, a whistle (whooshing) sound when on idle. It just drove me insane. So I had to return. Sorry Acer. It is a great laptop and I know that a owner of my return unit would enjoy it more then I.  I ended up getting a Legon Y540 laptop.","This thing is a beast for the price, I bought it during the prime day sale. Build quality is solid with a metal lid and interior, the bottom is plastic but feels very sturdy. Coming from an older 60Hz screen you can see a real difference on this beautiful 144Hz display.  The screen is very crisp and bright. Then there is the performance which is outstanding and lets you max out most games without getting excessively hot during gameplay. Definitely satisfied with my purchase no buyers remorse here!","Received laptop on Thursday, specs are great and it was playing games on high settings at 70+ FPS... then I turned it off and it refused to turn back on. Seems a fair few other people had this problem. Torn between dealing with the two week repair process or returning it and getting something else. Edit: after finding more complaints of the same issue I\u2019ve opted to return it instead of rolling the dice and getting another bricked unit.","In my opinion, this computer has major BIOS issues.  If I plug in more than one USB device (USB-C + Type A or two Type A), then my externally attached USB mouse stops working and the second device may or may not work depending on the type of device plugged in.  It does not matter if I am using a high end Logitech mouse or a cheap wired MS USB mouse, the USB port is just functionally not working.  Yes, this could be driver issues but, Intel and NVIDIA drivers are up to date and say they are functioning.  So, this leads me to believe it is a BIOS issue. By the way, the BIOS is useless because it has practically no options loaded into it.  I don't know how a company in the year 2019 gets away with creating a BIOS that has literally no options available for edit like this but, Acer has pulled this off.  This also leads to my suspicions about my USB problem being a BIOS issue.  If I could mess around or even determine the method the USB is configured by the BIOS, I may be able to resolve my own problem! Also, be advised the USB-C port may be a USB v3.1 Gen 2 port but, it is NOT a Thunderbolt 3 port so do not expect TB3 devices to work with this laptop.  I can't confirm it is an actual Gen 2 port because, like I said above, I cannot connect two USB devices to this laptop....I don't know why it has 4 USB ports because they can't be used. Let me say that I am not a gamer but, the specs on this computer closely match the high-end workstation I built myself for development work so, I thought I would give this a go to work while I am out of the house.  I am seriously considering returning the machine and getting a different machine from an Acer!","Absolutely love my Acer Predator Helios 300. This is the 2019 model with the GTX 1660 ti. It can run any game I play on it with out a problem. It is also upgradable from 16gb Ram to 32gb Ram and it has 2 empty hard drive slots. The screen looks amazing with 1080p 144Hz 3ms. I think it\u2019s truly your best bang for your buck. I don\u2019t regret buying this laptop at all. Just look at the reviews on YouTube. I did a lot of research before hand and this is the winner by far. If you are looking for a great gaming laptop look no more, this is it.","At first, I enjoyed this laptop a lot. I love how compact it is because it makes it easy to take to class with me for notes during lectures. However, this laptop has been an absolute nightmare. I bought this mostly because I needed a laptop for college, and the fact that it was a \"gaming\" laptop is just a plus because hey, who doesn't want that? Being busy with college, I have not used it to game. I played Minecraft and Stardew Valley on it for only a few hours and THAT'S IT since I bought it. For whatever reason, this laptop has been crashing and giving me the blue screen of death constantly, and it has erased hours and hours of work I put in on my assignments, and it has kicked me out of online tests!!!! This laptop was supposed to help with school, not destroy my grades!!!! The battery life was awful until I jumped on their website to wait 2 hours for a solution of updating my driver from their customer support rep. It lasted maybe 2 hours max? It will also randomly start buzzing loudly as if I am running an intensive game, but all I am doing is using the Edge internet browser and Microsoft words, two apps that are meant to be used with Windows! I spent weeks with this issue and time after time, their customer support has disappointed me with solutions that do not fix the problem. They say they are sorry for the inconvenience but that's a load of s***. It's past my return window now because I have been stuck in a cycle of trying to reach them, waiting for them to reply, then getting email messages days later, all on top of trying to stay on top of school work. They won't give me my money back so that I can buy an actual reliable laptop that runs normally without promising to be a better performancing \"gaming laptop,\" and instead keep trying to get me to return it to be repaired! That'd be an option if they had told me sooner, but I definitely don't trust them to do it in a timely matter now. I have wasted far too much time and effort and sacrificed MY GRADES to deal with this. In a nutshell, this laptop is unreliable and will crash on you for just using Microsoft Edge (internet) and Microsoft Word. This is without using it for its intended purpose: GAMING. Their customer support stinks and will drag out the issue for weeks, no matter how many times you express your frustration on how it is impeding your progress in school!","I'm a week into owning this thing and it's an absolute monster. I read a lot of the 1 star reviews, and I think a lot of that is due to Windows 10, and not the laptop itself. The new version of Windows 10 has a lot of issues that still need to be worked out, but this laptop benchmarks way above anything else at this price point. They keyboard feels nice, the backlighting is great, solid 100+FPS on all games Ultra settings so far. The one-button Overclock (Turbo) is nice as well but put headphones on because as others have said, the fans get pretty noisy. So far so good, I will update if anything comes up but definitely worth the buy. I purchased a Samsung Odyssey+ to go with it and the VR capabilities of this laptop are pretty insane. The Windows Mixed Reality Portal has a lot of issues that need to be worked out, and Windows crashes quite a bit when dealing with VR, i.e. make sure you plug the USB cable in BEFORE the HDMI cable or else your system will hang...what the heck? No one told us that, I had to dig it up on a forum post, let's just hope they patch out some of the bugginess of WMR soon. The audio isn't too bad, if you're just chilling watching a movie, it's fine. I use a pair of Bluetooth Noise Cancelling headphones so even with the fans on MAX setting, I can't hear anything except what I'm watching\/playing. I installed a 2TB SSD to go with the 256GB that was already in there. The installation process was easy. Just YouTube it, don't take it to an ACER center.","Only been using this for a few days but I can easily say this is one of the best computers I\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s extremely quick to boot up and get started. The screen is amazing you\u2019ll definitely notice the difference. Games look great and run fantastic even at max settings. The Killer Double shot pro wifi program and chip I was skeptical about, but if you\u2019re coming from a laptop that doesn\u2019t have something similar to this it is very noticeable. The wifi I have has always given me a headache as having even one thing download spikes my ping to the thousands. However with this even with other people on the wifi I\u2019ve noticed my ping doesn't jump up and down as much as usual. Also, in the program you can enable \u201cgame sense\u201d and the program will disable anything on your pc that might be downloading or bogging down your internet. The fans aren\u2019t as loud as some reviews make them out to be. Unless you\u2019re running turbo (which I really think isn\u2019t needed for most games) Overall I am very impressed with this laptop. It looks and feels great, runs faster than some custom built pc\u2019s I\u2019ve seen even. Definitely would recommend to anyone on the fence about getting a new laptop. If you have the money, this is worth it.","I bought this to replace an MSI Wokstation\/laptop. There is no comparison. This Acer Predator uses an NVME m.2 drive that is super fast. loading time is unbelievably fast. Colors are much better - no cheap screen on this one. I thought Acer was a cheap knock off, but these machines are well engineered to work as a complete unit. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Acer is not a manufacturer who buys the cheapest modules available, then slaps them together with a bunch of software patches to make them play together. This thing does everything faster, including video editing, and stays cool doing it. I had n o problem adding a 2 tb SSD drive. Everything just works!","Bought the laptop for gaming purpose. Played on it for hours Total War 3k which heavily utlizes resources and with graphics on high setting I get a very nice fps. I didn't test the battery The laptop feels solid thanks to the aluminum screen back cover and keyboard frame. It is well built with slim design and very smooth keyboard with classy blue color. Thermal design of this model is better than the 2018 model. I played games on the laptop for hours  in a warm room around 27\u00b0C and the CPU never exceeded 85\u00b0C while GPU was below 80\u00b0C also the keyboard never felt hot. I used stock setting without cooling pads but turned the coolboost option on ( that is different from Max fan speed) What I don't like is the limited storage but there is one empty slot for M.2 NMVe and another one for 2.5\" ssd. I saw a youtuber who further undervolted the processor to -0.17 and worked for him with a decrease of -4\u00b0C for the CPU. I'm planning to get mine done too. One more thing I disliked was the power cord partially blocking the side vent. However,  I overcome this issue by turning the cord to the other side but it might be somehow inconvenient when using the left side ports frequently","I purchased this laptop for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  She moved up from an i7 8th generation and 1060 GTX to this beast and is very happy.  The system is solid, feels good, has a great keyboard, and plenty of power.  I did go ahead and purchase a Samsung EVO SSD to add additional storage space, but for the price of the system at the time ($999) I am not complaining - and I would recommend the EVO SSD over a traditional secondary storage drive.  The speed difference is night and day when installing and playing games. If you are looking for a nice portable gaming system, this is for you.  If you are wanting to stream to a service such as Twitch, this system would also fit the bill.  It includes the on-board Intel graphics and the Nvidia discrete graphics.  OBS is very happy with this configuration, and with the i7, there is enough power to go stream and game.  I wouldn't run a game on \"ultra\" while trying to stream but if you want to game and stream at the same time, this will perform that fairly well.","I researched several laptops looking for one to mainly do business and edit photos and videos, but also with enough power to play some high level games at times. This laptop covers both needs and at a reasonable price. It has a premium feel all around from the metal frame to the keyboard. Packaged like you would expect a high end product to be as well. The 256 ssd was lower than I wanted but with the ability to add another ssd in the additional PCIe slot and a 2.5 slot there are plenty of options. I opted to go ahead and buy a 1TB ssd and it was extremely easy to install. Battery life isnt anything special, but I expected that and no high expectations for a 59w. So far looks like during gaming or heavy usage in video editing, 3 hours at best. Basic internet and office work, 5-6. I would recommend this laptop, very happy with my purchase.","I, personally have 2 very main problems with this laptop. First, the good. This laptop is so powerful and fast. The game engine works smoothly and can play almost all the games out there at full setting, with a but of problem. It gets hot, very hot. Almost 90 degrees celsius hot. The fan at full blast can lower it to at least 75 degrees but this full blast is loud. Like there is a jet plane 30 miles outside your room but right in front of you and not as loud. And here is the USB and other connection problem, still. The others made the same complaints before by the looks of it. If more than 3 powerful devices are connected (USB or blue tooth and etc.) The whole thing disconnects and tries to reconnect. I have to disconnect the thing I don't use at the moment and reconnect if I need it again. For a powerful laptop, it is disappointing. My main concern is the heat and the USB connection. The loudness of the fan is not my concern if it did its job, cooling the laptop. I am willing to keep the laptop but I don't know about buying it again in the future.","So far this laptop has been amazing, especially for the price. I got it on sale on Prime Day for under $1000. I had my last laptop for 5 years, a bottom of the line Alienware with a GTX 860m in it. This laptop completely blow it out of the water, as it should. I was going back and forth between getting this one or one that had an RTX 2060 and ultimately decided the GTX 1660 ti was the better value. It seems once you get into the RTX 2060 and above you start to get diminishing return in the laptop field due to less effective cooling in laptops. I looked at a lot of benchmarks done across numerous laptops, and there wasn\u2019t a big enough performance gain, in my opinion, to warrant the $300 to $1000 price increases. Update: still running great. One minor issue I had is when I tried to update the GTX 1660 ti driver I had to do it through the device manager, for some reason when I downloaded it straight from Nvidia it said it wasn\u2019t compatible.","Granted I've only had this laptop in my possession for a couple of days, but so far I like it a lot. Gaming on a 15.6\" screen will take some getting used to. (My previous gaming laptops were ASUS ROG models with 17 inch screens, and my desktop has a 27\" monitor.) but the picture quality is the best I've seen. The Predator has some great components with the 9th gen i7 processor, the Nvidia 1660 Ti GPU, 16 GB of RAM and an NVMe SSD. The SSD is 256 GB so I added a Seagate Firecuda 2TB hybrid drive for an additional expense of $80. In addition, the Killer networking hardware\/software seems to work very well. That's the good. The bad is that it comes with Windows 10 (but what's a practical alternative?), and Microsoft is very aggressive in pushing its services. It can be difficult if not impossible to remove them. I make my own choices for browser, search engine, email clients, etc, but when I removed Edge I got notifications every time I started up on my startup screen pushing Edge and not once but twice. ( I think and hope I finally removed it. I'm not a fan of advertising, and I don't trust Microsoft.) And I'm not willing to trust \"the cloud\", so Dropbox and cloud storage were refused. I've downloaded several games onto the hybrid drive but only played Destiny 2 for about an hour and a half and a little of Age of Wonders III. As I said the graphical quality is the best I've seen, but Destiny 2 did freeze after I'd been playing for an hour or so which I assume was due to the GPU overheating (and I do use a notebook cooler), but I'm also assuming there are things I can do to prevent this in the future. For one thing, the game was optimized by the Nvidia GeForce Experience software and I'll have to look at their selections. I should also adjust the fan speeds, but I haven't looked into this yet either. So, if I should have to amend this review (and recommendation) in the future I will do so, but so far I'm very impressed with what Acer has provided and at what cost. I gave battery life and camera quality three stars because the laptop will always be plugged in, and I'll rarely if ever use the camera (though from what I've seen in YouTube reviews the image quality is certainly IMO acceptable for ordinary uses). Update: On the day after I wrote this review, I played some Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Dragon Age: Inquisition, WOW, Alpha Centauri and more Destiny 2. GeForce Experience optimized the games at ultra quality. I tinkered with the fan settings setting them slightly higher than standard (about 4000-4200 rpms and will fine adjust this more). The games looked great and played well without any problem. The fans did make some noise, but it's a whoosh and not a whine, and for me not terribly intrusive. As I said, I'll adjust the fan speed some more and may be able to reduce it even further. The speakers by the way are great with excellent sound quality and volume for a laptop. The fan noise never interfered with the sound at my settings. Again, well done, Acer. Two months later, and I'm still very impressed with this computer. I installed the new Crytek Neon Noir Ray Tracing Benchmark for ray-tracing effects without an RTX gpu, ran it fullscreen at 1920x1080 and ultra and got a score of 5529 with very fluid playback and frame rates that varied from about 45 to the upper 70s. The benchmark would seem to be quite the workout for a system and the Acer got a commendable result IMO.","This is my second purchase of a gaming laptop over thr 2019 summer. The first was by another large brand and was a total bust,  returned within the 30 day amazon window due to serious hardware issues right out of the box. This one had restored my faith in buying gaming laptops online without being able to \"test\" them out. If you understand what you're getting with this machine and have a very clear picture what it is you want out of it, then this is a fantastic machine. The graphics card is powerful enough to run most modern games at mid to high settings with zero issues. The powerful CPU and mid tier specs set you up at a good starting point to boot up and game, literally right out of the box, with little need to really add anything other than a good gaming mouse. The screen is one of the better ones and usually can be found on more expensive laptops. I have very minimal light bleed on mine and it's not noticeable at all during normal use. The keyboard is comfortable to work on although the letters are a bit squished together so it did take me a little bit to get used to. Upgrading is super simple. I had a second SSD hard drive installed within 5 minutes of popping the bottom off the laptop and there is still space to add yet another drive. At this time, I've got a second 500 gig drive to complement the main 250g drive and I also have a portable 250g Samsung rugged ssd drive that uses the 3.1 USB C port should I need even more space. This laptop, for me, is not a replacement for my desktop. It's just a really nice partner to it for those days I want to snoodle up on the couch and game with my dog on my lap. It runs warmer than some other laptops but this is normal. It's a gaming laptop. It's actually quite good for gaming laptop standards. The fans work really well but can get loud so you'll need headphones or a cooling pad underneath to help with that. I use a cooling pad and the noise doesn't bother me or anyone else when I decide to game a bit while watching a movie with the boyfriend on the couch. I installed an app that monitors CPU and GPU temps and it's never gone above 75c while gaming. While doing regular stuff, its in the low 30s and the fans run near silent. Battery is poor so stay plugged in and you'll be fine while you game. When not gaming and just doing regular stuff, the battery might last 3.5 hours if you dim the screen to 50 percent. This honest doesn't affect me much. When I use it, I stay pluggef in. If I need longer battery life, I have two other laptops specifically purchased for productivity that I can use to solve that issue. It's quite small and light for how powerful it is and for being a 15 inch monitor. I love that because as a female who often likes to game while she travels, I don't want to lug around heavy bulky gear just to do that. This little guy lets me pop it into my thin laptop sleeve along with it's charger, which is also a nice compact size, and my gaming mouse and earbud headphones and I'm good to go. Also, it doesn't scream gamer the colors are a soft white and blue and the design itself is nice but not aggressive like their Helios 300 of last year, which I purchased as a gift for my sister.  Happy girl here. All in all, I'm really happy with this purchase and can see that this laptop will last me at least 4 to 5 years gaming-wise because of the powerful components Acer used. This little fella is definitely a declaration against all other gaming laptop companies out there. For what I needed and wanted, it's perfect. Beautiful screen, powerful components, upgradeability in memory and storage, small compact size, and tech that will still be viable a few years down the line. Definitely a huge improvement over their Helios offering of last year.","I have had this laptop for about a month now and I really love it. The blue is super nice. I had the older model and I liked that laptop too but I really got this for my Oculus Rift S and glad I got it because it works! It is a little smaller then the hold one but I like it. Little guy can take a hit of heat but that\u2019s why we get a cooling fan right?","Waited about a month to write this review. I had been researching budget gaming laptops for a long time, and finally decided that I was going to buy this. I bought it for $1200 and before it could ship I saw it go on sale for $999 for prime day. So I quickly canceled that order and bought it at the sale price, which sold out fast. Thanks Amazon! As of the time of this review it is on sale again for $999, if you are on the fence, don't be, buy it now! I love this laptop. It plays all modern games I have on Ultra with zero issues. I have about 100 hours now in the Witcher 3, simply beautiful. I have tested other games such as metro Exodus, ff14, AC: Odyssey, Farcry 5, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, etc. All perform flawlessly on max settings However, the machine does get quite hot. As other reviewers have pointed out it is normal for gaming laptops to operate between 75 - 90 celcius. I've also noticed this laptop is cooler when you are in a cooler environment. I spend half my time in Mexico and half in Seattle. While gaming in Seattle the laptop doesn't go past 85, while in Mexico it will easily reach mid 90s. Unfortunately in this case since it comes undervolted to -.125 there's not much you can do besides setting fans to Max in the predator sense application, which definitely will cool it back down to 78-82. I also always use it on my lap with a laptop cooler, which does not affect the temperature for better or worse. Aside from gaming, it also handles everyday computing excellently. I do suggest getting a 2.5\" SSD for additional storage. The keyboard is very good, even though it is strangely placed. The mousepad is a good size, but is hard to click effectively, so I suggest getting a decent gaming mouse. The screen hinge is like firm butter, and the top of the lid and keyboard area is aluminum, hardly seen in a laptop at this price point. In my opinion, it is going to be hard to beat this laptop unless you spend more than $2k. Definitely a must buy if you're in the market for a budget or even mid range gaming laptop.","I got this laptop on Amazon Prime Day and was pretty stoked on it. After all, it's a lot of power for a gaming laptop at this price range. However, after booting up the first time and getting Windows 10 setup, I shut it down to run some errands. Now it won't turn on plugged in or not, fully charged and ready to go. I didn't want to believe the bad reviews people were leaving on this laptop, but now I'm one of them.","Bricked after updating windows and wouldn't recognize 2nd drive. Spent over an hour with Predator support. I was very excited for this product and will update my review if I ever get my exchange. ***Updating After Receiving Replacement*** This laptop is a beast. It can handle any game you throw at it. Features: Turbo button. If you're anything like me the idea of tinkering and micro managing settings seems tedious. \"Say no more!\" says Acer and they provide a turbo button. With 1 press you automatically overclock your gpu and cpu and boost your fans to get the most out of your latpop! Predator button: Another wonderful addition. With a press of a button you can bring up a management screen to adjust everything. You can set bandwidth priority you can set fan speed. If you like to tinker, this is wonderful. Hardware: This laptop is an amazing piece of equipment for the price. Especially if you catch it on sale like I did for prime day ($999 are you kidding me?!). You would be hard-pressed to build a desktop with this much power for the same price, including a 144hz monitor. Speaking of 144 hz: As someone who has never played at anything over 60hz this is amazing. Its so smooth! The 1660ti makes gaming at 1080\/ultra a breeze for most games. The not so good: While the monitor is literally amazing, there are some spots along the edges during black screens. I assume this is just something we have to live with as most reviews mention it. The hard drive expansion, while not difficult warrants some research. Instead of simply having a plug and play SATA cable for a second hard drive acer sends you a cable and a rubber case of sorts. It is  not particularly difficult to install but you can damage your laptop if you don't know what you're doing. At the very least watch a YouTube video. Overall: This laptop is amazing for the price. This is THE BEST budget gaming option of the year. If you want to play upcoming games like Cyberpunk 2077 or have a relatively future proof machine for 1080 gaming this is an easy buy.","There is no better laptop on the market right now in this price range. 10\/10 would recommend. Good things to note: 1. This thing can do 120-150 FPS on Fortnite on my 4K TV. 2. This thing can do 200-400 FPS on Fortnite running on the laptop alone (1080p). 3. The 144Hz screen is incredible. Everything feels so buttery smooth. 4. The 1660 Ti is the real deal. It is not the MAX-Q version. One heck of a GPU. One weird thing to note: 1. There is a software bug that if you connect an external monitor and in display settings you decide to display to the external monitor and the external monitor alone, and you use an external controller like I do (USB controller), any click of the buttons or movement of the joysticks destroys the FPS of the game you're playing and make it literally unplayable. The workaround is to choose \"Extend desktop\" and just run the game on your external monitor and leave the laptop screen as just the desktop. Note: This bug was not present on a dell gaming laptop. Because of the extend desktop, this workaround works and there's no real issue here, just something to note. You just can't display only to the external monitor if you want to use a USB-connected controller, you gotta do extend desktop.","I received the laptop brand new unopened. But after taking it out of the box, I found the metal frame on one side has a slight bent at one USB port, which surprised me as a brand new laptop. Obviously, it was a manufacturing defect that went unnoticed during QC. I am sending this laptop back to Amazon for a replacement and will see how they handle the issue. I will update my experience later.","Absolutely love the build, form factor (pretty slim and portable for a gaming laptop), screen (vibrant and responsive), aesthetics (I'm a fan of the blue colour scheme) and performance. The keyboard could do with a little more travel because sometimes I keep typing extra letter unnecessarily but it isn't difficult to get used to. The trackpad is smooth and works well with no problems.I take the laptop to university every day and I do have to take the charger with me which is not ideal but it doesn't add a lot of extra weight so you are still able to run to class when you're late.  I use this laptop for gaming when I travel and I have a more powerful desktop at home. In the main games that I run (PUBG, Apex Legends, GTA V, etc...) I noticed a difference of 10-15 frames per secind (my desktop is equipped with a GTX 1080ti and a Ryzen 7 1700) but all the games maxed out still run well above 60 frames per second. Overall the laptop is an excellent buy for the price and even though I had to pay import fees (I'm from South Africa) it was still the best performance laptop I could buy for the money.","I chose this gaming laptop after about a month of research, this laptop is in my opinion the best gaming laptop on the market currently for the price.  I added a 1tb ssd for storage which is this laptop's only problem imo. This laptop has EXCELLENT thermals, it NEVER thermal throttles due to the -.125 undervolt on the cpu and good cooling system so long as you dont block the vents and I live in a very hot area often the outside temp gets to 85+ degrees farenheit. I managed to undervolt to -.16 and i've seen others get as far as -.17. Doesn't have ray tracing but currently there aren't many games that support it and even those that do will lower your fps drastically and we're talking desktop gpu's here a laptop rtx gpu wont fair well FPS-wise. Doesn't have RGB which is a plus for me but to each their own.  Can easily get  ~144 fps on games that I play which are Dota 2, WoW, WoW Classic beta, DOOM, and i can get ~50 fps on TWW2 on ultra which isn't too bad.","I just received the the Acer Helios 300 I was able to snag from Amazon on Monday. This is the new 2019 i7\/9th gen model. I haven\u2019t done anything other than start setting it up for my son but so far it\u2019s build quality is very nice. It\u2019s all plastic but their is very little flex in the keyboard, the frame is solid and there is almost no flex in the screen. Reviews have stated the keyboard deck and cover are aluminum. This one definitely isnt - its a very hard plastic. There is significant light bleed around the bezel edges when the screen is dark. It almost appears as if the bezels are too tightly attached to the display. I don\u2019t see the bleed much when the screen is displaying graphics\/programs\/colors. It\u2019s extremely quiet, but that\u2019s probably because I\u2019m just sitting setting it up and don\u2019t have any programs running. Turning on the turbo fan switch makes the thing suuuuuuuper loud. So far, I really like it and can\u2019t wait to see it running some games. I want to compare it to the Lenovo Y740 I picked up the other day too (that is when that one finally ships in late August...) I\u2019ll give some more updates as we screw around with it. It\u2019s fairly heavy and bulky. It\u2019s definitely not a slim design but overall not too bad. Its a very good size display. I had purchased a 17 inch Lenovo Y740 as a second laptop but cancelled it for a 15 inch Y740. Im very happy I did this because I feel the 15 inch displays are perfect sizes for a laptop after using the Acer 300. The keyboard travel time isn\u2019t bad. I love this keyboard because it has the keypad included. The keyboard doesnt feel cramped with the added keypad even though this is a 15 inch machine. Keystrokes feel slightly mushy when pressing. The keys are illuminated in light blue which can be made darker or lighter with two of the F keys. The blue light isnt annoyingly bright or obnoxious like some laptops I have seen. There are a few bloatware programs added by Acer onto this laptop. I would suggest a clean install of Win10 and then heading to Acer to download their Predator Sense program. This is one Acer program you definitely want to keep and use. If not a clean install, do your research and find what programs to remove. IMO, immediately Nortons should come off. Updates to come as we move into gaming\/benchmarks\/testing.","Honestly, it feels like I'm getting more than I paid for. A lot of products are just plain disappointments, especially when it comes to the laptop game these days. You end up spending a lot more on pointless bells and whistles just to get the stuff you want or need. This thing is crammed full of the stuff you want at a solid price, and it's upgrade-able. And it looks really awesome in person. I love the shape and feel. I got it to play SWTOR and Elite Dangerous, and it handles both perfectly. It gets hot, as you'd expect, but the heat never bothers it. I play for hours without a worry or its fans even needing to go full-on. I only problem I have with it (which wasn't enough to cost it a star because this is barely a problem at all) is the name of the thing. I love its style, and I love how I can get matching headset, mouse, et cetera for it... But I do not like the name \"Predator.\" What were they thinking? They even make a backpack for this exact laptop with that branding. Who wants to run around with the word \"PREDATOR\" written across their back? I know that's a silly gripe, but a gripe nonetheless.","I was looking to upgrade my son's Dell Inspiron laptop that lacked a gaming quality graphics card. When I found this Acer Predator on Prime Day, I was so proud of my bargain...until it arrived. Immediately, I noticed backlight bleed along the top edge of the screen (see photo). We could have lived with this issue for the price. The deal breakers were the PC not recognizing the NVIDIA GeForce graphics card that came installed (supposedly), the keyboard area getting so hot during a game that it couldn't be touched and nearly melted the power cord, and the Predator Sense software never being able to launch. Acer support said the laptop likely had a hardware problem and needed warranty service.  Um, no thanks. We returned this to Amazon and purchased an MSI Stealth G65 laptop locally (for a few hundred more than this Acer) and absolutely love it.","This laptop is simply amazing, in my opinion it is the best you can get for under $1,200.00! It is so fast that the only limitation in speed I have seen is the internet connection. I have played Middle Earth, Shadow of War for about 10 hours so far and not had a single problem or glitch. It does get hot if you don't crank up the fans, but the controls for that are just a simple button push and it goes into Turbo mode. It has a feature called Predator Sense, which gives you control of overclocking the GPU and adjusting the fan speeds, plus it gives you a history graph of the CPU\/GPU temps and processing percentages. Under full gaming load playing Shadow of War I typically see temps of about 140 degrees Fahrenheit. When using the internet, MS word and Powerpoint, all at the same time, it isn't even working hard at all and the fans are just left on auto. It doesn't even get warm when I'm not gaming. I added a Samsung 1TB 870 EVO SSD the first day I got it to load my games on and it took me about 10 minutes to complete the installation. I'm no computer wiz either, it was a very easy addition. I plan to add another M.2 SSD in the future, and upgrade the RAM, but right now I am very happy with it. I highly recommend this laptop if you think it is what you are looking for. Update: I got a great deal on cyber Monday and upgraded the Ram to Crucial's 32GB (Two 16GB sticks) and added a Samsung 970 M.2 500GB SSD Hard drive to the second M.2 bay. This computer will now handle any task I want to do, be it gaming, video editing, or any other software I want to run. I now have another 50 hours of gaming on it without any issues at all. Battery life is not the greatest, but I knew that before I got it. On average it says it has about 3 hours remaining when using it mobile, though I have never used it unplugged for more than about and hour or so. Also, it will not let you use Turbo mode unless it is plugged in which is reasonable since it would probably drain the battery really fast anyway. I carry it with me to school in my Swiss Gear 1900 backpack and it doesn't seem to add much weight to my load. Also the WiFi reception is very good and almost always has full signal anywhere I use it. Because of the aluminum body, it feels very high quality. I am in love with this laptop and hope to get many years out of it. I will add another update to this review if I experience any problems.","Skip to bottom for Pro\/Con Summary! Good Processor and pretty good display 144Hz. Graphics card isn't the best going from a 1080 to a 1660Ti. A little over half as good. Then again it's a gaming laptop. Pros *Does not weigh as much as expected about half the weight advertised is the charger. *Keyboard\/hand wrest area feels of a thin metal I like it. *Graphics card isn't bad but I would not get anything worse than the 1660Ti. Runs Insurgency Sandstorm at about 60-70 frames on medium settings. *Keys feel nice *Battery Life is about 3 hours on Eco performance settings. Not bad for a gaming laptop. *Charges at a decent speed. *Hooked up to my Tv to watch a horror movie series from 2006. Looked terrible on the Tv and looked great on the laptop. *Colors were darker. *Allows for a drive directly in to the motherboard additionally to the 2.5 slot. *Comes with SSD framing and cable for the harddrive unlike some models. *Fan has an auto mode Was the best option for price most laptops have rediculous 2080s, 32gb ram, poor battery, and a little worse processor at a price of 1700-2000$ The Razers are 1600$ with even worse graphics cards. Back to the Acer Predator Helios 300 Cons *Screen feels of very cheap and flimsy plastic  BE CAREFUL! *Out of the box I tried closing the screen from the bottom side and the screen looked like it was about to pop out. *Gaming battery life is poor as expected. Maybe thats harsh to say but its still a con. ***Mousepad is absolutely horrendous. GET A GOOD MOUSE! The entire mouse pad is functional so if you try to left or right click the mouse moves or freaks out.*** *Fan very loud. Think similarly to the Jet engine PS4 fan in the summer time. *Poor Storage. *Charger is beefy and heavy. *Personal one. I'm not a fan of the spaced keys. *Gets very hot even proped up from the back sititng on the box, fan blasted after an hour of gameplay. Almost burns your hand. *Functions far to close to the overheating temperature of 90 Celsius at around 86 after an hour maxed fan. *Really annoying tribal music at startup but can be disabled in Predator settings. Best Pros *Great price for what it is *Ok battery for non gaming *Amazing potential for storage space *Not a bad graphics card but don't get anything worse. About 70% compared to a 1080 at 122% Worst Cons *Mouse pad is terrible *Construction is poor around the screen. *Performs VERY hot. *Fan is LOUD when gaming.","This laptop exceeded all of my expectations, especially for the price. All my computing needs are met, thanks to this unit, with the added bonuses of portability and cutting edge modern gaming capabilities. I can even simply plug it with an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse, and it outperforms my couple-of-years-old gaming desktop by leaps and bounds, in all capacities except for modular upgradeability. I would highly recommend this delightful piece of quality tech to anyone and everyone. I've built my own computers all my life and this purchase outshines my past experiences in all relevant respects.","I really like this laptop. It's powerful, and it fills my needs well. I use programs such as Premiere Pro, After Effects and Unity and I also play games like Apex Legends and Fortnite on it. This computer handles these tasks well. There are few things that really annoy me about this laptop. The keyboard is off center by A LOT. I'm constantly hitting the Predator button when I code and it gets to be incredibly annoying as time wears on. I don't use the number pad often, if ever, so I could have done without it and that would have helped with the centering of the keyboard. The shift key on the right is also too small. The second thing that bothers me is the speaker(s). They are in the front of the computer so if the computer is on your lap, the sound will probably be quite muffled. When it's on a hard surface, it sounds better but the sound itself is not of great quality. For reference, my 2012 MacBook Air's speakers have a more full sound and are head and shoulders above the speakers in this laptop. The third thing that bothers me is the fact that the computer cannot adjust brightness appropriately, automatically, when it's removed from AC power (my MacBook Air does). The same goes for when you plug in headphones or unplug them: there is no separate volume for headphones vs. the laptop's speaker. These are things I can generally look past but they bother me enough to keep them in the back of my mind when buying another laptop.","While the internals for this are nice on paper, it would appear that there's just generally poor quality. I've seen several reviews about backlight bleed around the edges of the monitor, and mine definitely had this. Any dark screen had the corona effect going on. I also experienced poor operating stability; at times I would get hung up just running a single program and have to force restart or force shutdown. A brand new unit shouldn't have these issues. Returned.","Not as thin as a razor but not as thick as an Alienware, very powerful and I can play everything seamlessly from regular games to VR. You get a lot of bang for the buck with this laptop. This laptop is also very good at staying cool while playing games and I haven't even repasting the processors yet, not sure if I'm going to :-) I watch the few reviews on the 2019 version of this laptop and am very glad I made the decision to purchase it. I am very pleased. My only real complaint is that while playing games you're not going to have much battery life but that's pretty common.","I am revising the review as I was able to fix the issue with the BLACK screen after every windows restart attempt. Now it is the fastest and nicest laptop I have owned. The predator sense makes it very easy to get all the power you need out of the GPU and CPU. I added a 1tb SSD and a 2tb HDD. I had to move the INCLUDED SSD to the empty SSD SLOT and put my new SSD in the other SSD SLOT. For some reason ACER is putting the included SSD in SLOT 2 and this causes the computer to get confused on RESTARTS... It was fine on POWER UP. Tried to Install X-Plane 11.  The X-Plane 11 download install takes a while. When it was done the screen was black and was not going to come back on.... I had to hard shutdown computer by holding down power button. Screen came on after reboot I updated the nvidia and windows drivers, thought this would fix it but after a reboot the screen would not come on... Hard shutdown and reboot and screen worked... I am seeing multiple instances of the screen going black, keyboard lights if you touch a key, but the screen does not come back on... Only solution so far with a 12 hour old laptop is to hard shutdown and reboot... I see lots of comments of a similar problem in 2018... This is 2019, this problem should have been sorted out by now...","I use this laptop for game development when I\u2019m traveling. I use UE4, 3ds Max, and substance painter regularly on this device. It can handle having all three open at the same time. Just like my desktop. If I wanted to game with this I\u2019m confident I\u2019d have no issues maxing out settings and maintaining smooth frames. Gets pretty loud but that\u2019s generally expected from a gaming laptop. Stays nice and cool though. Battery performance is better than expected however I don\u2019t leave without it :) The SSD it comes with is a bit small. There are two expansion slots that I\u2019ve taken advantage of and now have just shy of 2TB of storage. The device is heavy. Built like a rock though. Feels like a very very sturdy machine. I first received it with a broken backlight. Contacted Acer support and there was no hassle. Really easy to get an RMA, unlike other manufacturers. They don\u2019t keep you updated on status of repair though. Sent it out and a week and a half later got it back. Quick turn around from my experience with ASUS, Dell and Microsoft. I\u2019ve been very happy with the performance and the price is such a bargain. I honestly hesitated to buy but I now encourage others to take the jump because of how great this machine is!","I bought this laptop as a well needed upgrade. Everything about it seems like it would be. It worked well for a little while, but shortly after the excitement of opening it and enjoying the display, I found trouble. Anything I downloaded ran into roadblocks. Either immediately or over time. I tried many different fixes and nothing worked until I finally contacted Acer support itself. That proved ultimately unhelpful, but they said that they'd send me a new version of windows 10 to boot from to see if that would fix the issue. After about a month waiting, and dealing with the problems the computer had, I got the usb and followed the instructions. Now the computer is in worse shape than ever, being stuck in boot-up screen recovery with an error that has no information online on how to remedy. Meanwhile, the Acer website won't let me log in to continue the rapport so instead I have to start from scratch with them and who knows how long that will take. SO not a good experience at all. my 5 year old Lenovo remains my go to system.","Great computer, i did an unnecessary swap though. I swapped thermal paste to conductonaut just to see.... I was able to raise core under voltage from -.125 to 0.090 and expanded turbo boost times and power, got performance boost on core and still have everything cooler than it was before, not that it was an issue, this is way cooler running than 7700 CPU predator. One thing I found is One of the ram modules for the gpu wasnt covered with enough grease but I fixed that with additional thermal paste on heatsink that would of been used for the 2 ram modules that aren't there...... another think take care of removing this heat spreader thing around the gpu, it can fold easily and get ruined, I dont know if it is necessary but I returned it to its spot after I conformal coated the sensitive bits and gave the liquid metal treatment. Right now cpu runs 4.0 to 4.2 ghz during xtk stress test and 2055 mhz for GPU ... temps stay at 70\u00b0 c while gaming","I will say a few words based on someone who is not using it primarily for gaming. (I do intensive CPU and GPGPU computations.) I have used this laptop for a few months now. Good things: - Good thermal performance. Has the option to quiet the fan in an office or library setting, but has the CoolBoost feature to provide some additional RPM. Even so, I'm using a cooling pad. The CPU is 6 cores so anything that is CPU-intensive will need to have more heat dissipated than a 4 core laptop with the same chassis. They undervolted from the factory which definitely helps cool it down by a few degrees. I really appreciate how quiet it is. It will almost certainly not draw attention in a quiet room. Of course, don't take it for granted - a high ambient temperature will easily nullify all these gains. - The boot time is consistently about 5-6 seconds. Much better than the 15 seconds my previous laptop had even after I replaced its hard drive with an SSD. You can use the PredatorSense software to disable the sound during boot time. Worth noting: - Keyboard keys. I would have preferred a dedicated power button off to the side instead of it being part of the keyboard. I have not accidentally pressed it while cleaning the keyboard but it is of note. As someone who uses the number pad quite frequently, the placement of the right arrow and the 0 key might take a bit of getting used to. The keys themselves have good action through and I have not had any problems with key presses. The sides are white and the WASD and arrow keys have a blue edge to them, which is much better than the red theme of the previous laptop. The backlit is fine but I do not use it at all - the white sides already help with visibility. - Bloatware. As usual, uninstall all the garbage that comes with it. There are a few that you might not want to uninstall, especially the PredatorSense software (activated by the key next to NumLock). I also make sure to regularly clear space, especially after a Windows update. The default storage is 256 GB so it will quickly fill up. - Battery. I have gotten a rather wide variation of battery life. It is definitely not designed to be long-lasting 8-10 hours; you will need to bring your charger for extended periods. Tips to save battery life apply to every laptop. Most important is to dim the screen as much as possible and to minimize the time of tasks that end up increasing RPM, including surfing the web (note the high CPU and RAM usage by Firefox, Chrome, etc; and no videos, streaming!). Unlike my previous laptop, you have to take the bottom lid to expose the battery so you cannot replace it with a larger one. - External monitor. The HDMI works, but if you have a 60 Hz monitor, the laptop screen will also go down to 60 Hz if a video is playing on the monitor, such as a Twitch stream or a YouTube video. If, on the monitor screen, you go to a different tab, you get back 144 Hz on the laptop. The 144 Hz is very smooth and it adds a lot to the experience. - Webcam. Somehow something got messed up during initial configuration, and very early on, the webcam light turned on whenever I watched a video on YouTube. Very strange, almost like the NSA was spying on me. Luckily I do not use the webcam at all and disabled it. For those that do, make sure you fidget around with the settings until it works. - Audio. The speakers are not great, use a headset. And DO make sure to uncheck the \"Enable audio enhancements,\" which may be on by default and produces a much worse sound than if it were disabled. Even a tone-deaf person can tell the difference. Not sure why the option even exists, to be honest. Nitpicks: - Outer design. I don't mind the logo, but I wish that they removed the blue streaks, which detract from a professional look. In terms of bringing this laptop to a meeting or other professional setting, it's on the edge between sleek and tacky, in my opinion. It can be mitigated by putting on some laptop stickers for those who are into that. I have noticed much criticism on the internet about the flashy looks of most gaming laptops, but frankly, I wouldn't be too self-conscious about how your laptop looks. - There is a weird thing where the screen flashes red for a few frames before returning to normal every time it brings up the login screen. This happens both upon startup and after pressing Windows-L. I do not know what is causing this but it is slightly annoying. - There is a moderately loud beep that sometimes happens when I plug in the charger before turning the laptop on or while it is booting, or awaking the laptop from sleep. Also slightly annoying. The loudness of the beep seems to be independent of the speaker volume. Overall, great laptop and great value too. Don't be dissuaded by the number of cons vs. pros in my list, they are very minor compared to all the great things that this device offers.","Edit: If you are using ethernet cable for gaming and it's not working properly, go in \"Killer Control Center\" then go in settings and turn off \"Advanced Stream Detect\". Amazing laptop for the price, really good desgin (thermals aswell) and quite compact compared to last year's model. There is back light bleed but only noticeable when displaying something completely dark\/black (for example when laptop is booting up.) and some back light bleed is in all models of helios 300 so don't worry about it. Also black light bleed is not noticeable at all during normal use or whilst gaming. However, if you see more than expected back light bleed, do contact amazon tech help and sort it out. Battery life is actually better than expected for this power hungry gaming laptop with such a small battery. I highly recommend getting a 2.5\" or m.2 nvme ssd. There is one empty slot for 2.5\" hdd\/ssd and one empty m.2 slot (with another m.2 slot having 256gb ssd pre-installed). I'd suggest 1tb m.2 nvme ssd which goes for around $100 on amazon. Keybaord is really good, though it comes with just blue backlight & no rgb, that rgb model for same price is only available in Australia. You can get rgb model on amazon but you will have to pay more and you will get 512gb m.2 ssd instead of 256gb which is installed in this one. Trackpad is also better than expected since you usually have low expectations from trackpad in a gaming laptop, where you would plug external mouse for gaming anyway. USB-C port does not support thunderbolt 3 or video output, it's just for connecting external USB-C devices, or dongles if you want more ports. Display is really good, 144hz refresh rate ~ 3ms response time makes it one of the best displays in laptop of this price point & bezels are way smaller compared to last year's model. It also feels and looks much lighter than last year's model thanks to compact degsin and actual weight decrease of about 250g from last year's model. Do enable turbo mode (by pressing the turbo button) if you do anything demanding as it will increase the fan speed, so no thermal throttling, it would increase cpu power limit and overclock gpu to extreme. You will get better performance for both gpu & cpu and even ram this way. In my opinion it's the best laptop for the price (I paid $1200 but you can get it for $999 on prime day) if you do photo\/video editing or gaming\/high performance demanding work.","great computer with great performance and quality except i hear a constant echo when audio is played. I tried every solution i could find on the internet and there is still an echo. All of my other devices work fine with the same 2 headphones but when i use this there is huge echo. Predator Sense also stopped working after a few hours using this for first time.","It's a wonderful piece of hardware. Powerful, sturdy and with good thermals and high quality display. I must immediately warn about certain things (photos included): 1. After only a couple of weeks of hardcore gaming the S and D keys wore off (the 'S' is now just a white spot) 2. The backside has a Predator logo and two blue clear plastic stripes. The stripes won't lit up, the logo will - as of August 2019 there is no software solution for this - the logo will always be lit even though in 2018 version of this laptop you could configure it via PredatorSense software. You can't do it here. 3. The plastic cover picks fingerprints LIKE CRAZY - you can actually see some of them on the photos. 4. Even though the touchpad has Windows Precision it's not so precise. 5. Battery lasts 1.5 hours while not even gaming, even though tech reviewers claim it to be 4 hours. 6. Must be some software bug but YouTube videos occasionally (like every two minutes) lag and stutter. These may be dealbreakers for some people so I had to point them out (last one might be very minor with an easy fix, yet I couldn't find one still). Regardless it's a wonderful device that I am satisfied with.","This is a tip for people that encourage an issue that I did. When I tried using a headset the camera light would turn on and I'd also get weird surround\/echo audio with headsets. Open the app MaxxAudio app. It's the cause of this problem. And somehow it's pre-installed. I wasted lots of hours on this, even had support agents suggest a factory reset and sending the device to them for repair, DON'T. This fix is easy. You're welcome.","1) I got 2 BSODs on different occasions for different reasons. 2) Recently one of my keys \"enter key\" stopped working and I had to restart my computer for it to function again, which I know is definitely not normal 3) The laptop gets uncomfortably hot under load to the point that you can not keep your hand at the top of the keyboard deck for more than 5sec. 4)  The fans are always overworking themselves and the software really can not do much to help it. By overworking I mean that they spin faster than necessary. (2000rpm+) 5) Battery life is no where near 6hrs, I get 4 hrs and 15min whle on battery saver and on 25% brightness while browsing on the web. Other than that, it handles games well and if you can get it on sale, it will probably make up for it but for $1200 retail I would say look elsewhere.","The hardware seems to be pretty well designed and it plays various games pretty well. I don't mind that the battery life isn't great, as I just wanted a gaming PC that is moderately portable. But I started noticing that the laptop would light up at weird times, and it wouldn't fully boot when it was plugged in. Not a big deal, as I could unplug it, control-alt-delete, and it would boot fine. Eventually I noticed that some of the LEDs were flashing and when I went to open it and see what was going on, it was incredibly hot to the touch. The fans were not on. I powered it on and got the fans going and it cooled down. This happened a couple times and generally I kept it unplugged and powered off, to avoid this weird overheat-while-sleeping issue. I tried upgrading the OS and BIOS to see if it would fix the issue, but it didn't seem to. Eventually, it got stuck in the overheating state for some amount of time while I wasn't around. I'm assuming it was for hours, and when I tried to power it on, it couldn't see the internal disk, so it wouldn't boot. I booted with a Linux USB drive and it seems that the memory and CPU are fine, but Linux couldn't see the boot disk, either. I just tried replacing the internal disk to see if that would fix it, but the system doesn't see that disk, either, so I'm thinking that it wasn't (just) the disk that burned out, but probably a chip or cable running to the disk.","Was happy about the specs and price. Reviews were really good so I took the plunge on the Prime Day sale. First time turning it on I had to press the power button three times (this is with it connected to its charger.) Turned on and life was good. Finished initial setup. Went back again to start configuring it and the laptop refused to turn on. I reconnected to the power charger and the led would turn on indicating it's charging but then nothing. Beyond disappointed. Returning to Amazon today. Buyer Beware.","Like most positive reviews, this laptop rocks in terms of gaming performance to bang for your buck. Absolute steal for under $1k. I have the 2017 model version of this laptop too. The 2019 model looks cleaner with thinner bezels and has better hardware. The main gripe that prevented a 5 star rating is the damn fan noise. The fans are not silent at idle with temps hovering around 39-44 degrees C. You can definitely hear them spinning. I used a Soundmeter app on my phone and measured around 30 dB from about 2 feet away. 30dB is almost inaudible in a noisy room, but my living area is usually silent so the fan noise is noticeable. It's distracting when browsing the web or watching a show without headphones on. During gaming the fan noise gets pretty loud, around 55 dB, but that's to be expected. The predator sense software has limited functions in terms of adjusting fan speed, the lowest setting is around 2500 rpm for the CPU and around 2800 rpm for the GPU. It'll be nice to be able to adjust the fan speeds even lower. My 2017 model is silent during web browsing with temps the same at 39-44 degrees C.  Hell, even my crappy HP Pavilion laptop is silent at idle. What the hell, Acer?","Fantastic laptop right out of the box. The screen is really bright, colors are perfect and pop out. 4k capable I believe and VR capable. It runs my games at the highest settings. This thing is just as much of a beast as my desktop which has an i7 7700, 16 GB ram, z270 gaming pro carbon motherboard and a overclocked rtx 2070 xtreme by Gigabyte.","The laptop is great and everything is as expected or better! The keyboard feels nice, the only thing is that the Enter button is a little bit small. The case is really nice and there is no screen tearing. Gaming on it is extremely nice. I play with friends on Discord, and while playing Dota 2 on ultra settings and downloading 2 other games at the same time, I still had max FPS and my friends couldn't hear the fan at all. Speaking of the fan, it can get loud, but that is expected and it is no problem whatsoever, my friends can't hear it when gaming, unless I turn on turbo (which is unnecessary in 99% of the time, I have never used it so far except just to try it). The Predator key is super convenient and it gives you complete control over the laptop's hardware (fan, CPU, GPU). Only 1 problem has occurred, that is related to Windows 10, and that is when gaming with an xbox one controller, alot of input lag comes. E.g., when playing Rocket League with a controller, the FPS is still at 180 FPS but there is alot of lag. When playing with the controller disconnected, it is all good. Does anyone know how to fix this? This also happens in FIFA 19, and it's really annoying. Battery life is fine, obviously with these specs and such a demanding CPU the battery life is lower than say laptops with i5\/i3 and a bad GPU. If you're watching movies or TV shows, it'll be alright for a few hours. Overall, great laptop and the price is a joke, atleast $200 under other competitors. EDIT: In the newest Windows 10 update, the controller problems were fixed.","This laptop is the best when it comes to value. Great screen, and it's a lot thinner and lighter than it looks. And the trackpad is superb. I find myself unknowingly ditching my MX Master for the trackpad. The refresh is butter. In terms of battery, I'm getting around 3 - 4 hours consistently. Not sure how people are getting 6 hours. Finally, if you do a clean install, remember to undervolt the CPU. Out of the box, it's undervolted at 0.125v. Mine is undervolted at 0.128v.","This laptop is fantastic over the last version. Great thermals. THE SETTING TO KEEP THE KEYBOARD BACKLIGHT ON IS IN PREDATOR SENSE. The screen is bright. The keyboard feels a little funky but you get used to it. F2 gets you into the bios... WHICH you will need to update to the latest version right out of the box. You can find it on the acer website. The fans are loud but nothing too bad. When basic browsing this laptop is really cool. No warmth at all. I wish they would have had a 17.3 inch screen version... but that's fine. The internet speed is fast. It does come with a decent chunk of bloatware which... they probably get paid to put on there... so no gripe there. Touchpad to me is really nice. One complaint I have is this thing is a fingerprint magnet... and adding an SSD is no longer considered a self serviceable procedure... which is ... lame. The 256gb ssd is smaller than preferred but speedy. I would have preferred to keep the secondary NVMe m.2 drive and COMPLETELY DELETE the sata SSD drive in exchange for a larger battery... I picked it up for $999 on prime day. Best deal for the money for a laptop. Power to performance ratio. I don't regret it and you wont either.","I love everything about this laptop. I bought it specifically for gaming, but I'm also not a very tech-y person. The few things that I have yet to figure out are more 'on me' than the laptop itself. I have discovered (by accident) some extremely cool features, but more importantly - have been very satisfied with performance during gaming. The only downside is the sound from the speakers is not very clear. It's not \/bad\/, just not what I think it should be. Overall, a very fun piece to use for gaming and great value.","Plays everything I've tried at max settings smoothly. Absolutely amazing computer. The 144hz monitor is beautiful, and the graphics card is just incredible. It's fun downloading the latest game, turning every graphics setting to ultra, and just knowing it's going to run at 90+ fps right off the bat. Haven't even had to turn overclocking on yet, so I know it's going to be future proof for a few years at least. Can't say about battery life, because I always have it plugged in during gaming - but... it's a gaming laptop so no big deal, right?","Purchased this laptop for a SANS 660 Course, I had to travel to attend. One day in to the course, it started acting up. Took 18 tries to finally get the Windows factory reset to take. Then the laptop would not post or show any image on the monitor. It was a complete brick for the class. Thank Amazon for a great return policy. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE AN Acer PRODUCT AGAIN. You get what you pay for.","It's a very powerful gaming laptop with excellent heat dissipation. Actually, it is its great heat dissipation ability that allows people to make full use of its CPU and GPU. In comparison, my friend's $1800 gigabyte aero has a thinner chassis, a slightly better GPU, but his frame refreshing rate is only half of mine when we play the same game scene under the same gaming setup (without me turning on turbo), possibly due to heating issues. I also like this laptop's keyboard, which feels pretty comfortable. The only deficit of the laptop I bought was that one of the keys' plastic coating was scratched at the corner when it came, but that didn't affect my contentment to the product and I am happy to give it a 5-star.","So I\u2019ve always been a competitive laptop gamer and always want the latest and greatest. I spend many many days researching trying to find that perfect computer and this was a great option. Let me go through the pros and cons... Pros: 144hz screen - never actually had anything over 60hz because it\u2019s hard to get anything higher for cheap so this was a great treat and is buttery smooth. 1660 Ti - probably the main reason a lot of people get this laptop, the graphics card is great, it\u2019s relatively new, has 6gb memory. This card will run circles around the 1050ti and gives desktop GPUs a run for there money. CPU - has a great cpu which is very easily over clockabke via the settings, you can set the speed, fan speed and more. Small bezels - compared to some the bezels on this are quite good, the sides and top are narrow, bottom isn\u2019t too bad at all. Overall a nice size screen for viewing. Keyboard - mine only had a blue black light which is okay because I love blue. The keyboard feels good, nice quality and not too loud. Cons: Battery life is poor - can\u2019t get much use out of it but how often are you not near an outlet Light up logo on lid - really wish you could turn it off makes it look kinda cheesy and gamey, not super professional. All in all this is a great laptop for the money. So should you get this? Well if you want a laptop that is pretty sleek, fast, and can run almost any game on the market at high 60fps or higher. People do mention bad screen bleed, either I got a lucky unit or they are over exaggerating because I have very little if any. I do recommend a ssd addition the 256gb stock is small. There is an option for both a m.2 ssd and or a 2.5\u201d drive. Plenty of room to add storage. Best of luck on your decision!","Alright, so let me clarify a few things for those of you who have extreme OCD like myself: * Despite review models and seemingly even some customer models having this feature, the two lines on the back of the laptop nor the Turbo button light up. They look like they should, but they don\u2019t. Myself and some friends all have this laptop and none of ours light up, but I\u2019ve seen it in review videos and even the amazon reviews. It must just be a review model feature. Now that that\u2019s out of the way... this thing is a BEAST. Performs at or above most laptop models with RTX 2060\u2019s and 2070\u2019s. If you want anything less than an RTX 2080 this laptop is the ONLY one that makes sense unless you\u2019re really set on getting a laptop with a ray tracing card in it. You cannot beat the performance of this monster for the small price. 256GB SSD is small for games, so I went ahead and ordered a 2TB external HDD so I can run my games off of it, easy fix and I recommend you do the same so you\u2019re not frolicking around your drive all day trying to find where you can cut a gigabyte or two. Since it appeared that a LOT of people got a lemon with this laptop (see the 1 star reviews) I was determined to test mine heavily the first day to ensure mine wasn\u2019t. Charging port seemed weird but ended up just being me, it\u2019s a little tight and I\u2019m a little bit of an OCD freak. Ran prime95 for 10+ minutes finding no issues or errors and not reaching anything too high in regards to temps, very impressive. Also ran Heaven afterward and jacked the resolution up, ran very smoothly with an occasional hitch which was likely due to the Intel power saving settings that I later on changed, but it ran perfectly. Loaded up Borderlands 3, Overwatch, and CS:GO, all ran perfectly without a hitch. Overall I almost didn\u2019t order this laptop due to the one star reviews but I\u2019m glad I did, I encourage you to try it if you too are holding off due to the apparent high volume of lemons. Running 1.08 BIOS and it\u2019s smooth as butter, couldn\u2019t be happier with it so far. Temps also haven\u2019t hit over 83, and went as low as 20\u2019s idle when I left it running while I was at work. 0 regrets and I\u2019ll likely be buying next generation of the Helios as well.","Look I see some peoples reviews having issues with their laptops, but those are far few in between. This thing is honestly a monster for the money. I use an external monitor personally but I can edit 4k footage and export no problem, and I can stream and game with absolutely no problem either. This thing has a ton of ports but if you need more just pick up a type-c hub for its type-c port. Even better amazon has credit if the money is too much. Thats what I did, and it has made my work, and my life a lot easier and more enjoyable. Plus and this is the biggest plus, the specs are good enough to where you probably wont have to upgrade for quite a while. All in all I'd say this is a stupidly good deal.","It's known that these Acer models have backlight bleeding but some are much worse than others. Mine is pretty bad compared to what I've seen to youtube, so I will be exchanging my laptop. Make sure to do a backlight bleed check (by making the background all black or go to youtube and use one of their backlight bleeding vids. The specs and the build quality itself are amazing for the Helios - but the screen seems to have some quality issues.","This is hands down the best gaming laptop for the money at this time. The 1660TI performs incredibly well at 1080p, taking full advantage of the 144hz display. The i7 CPU boost and maintains 4ghz regularly without hitting thermal throttle. It can handle VR (I tested with a rift s), and every modern title that I've thrown at it well over 100fps. Almost every other laptop at this price includes the MAX-Q version of the 1660TI, which is about 40% slower, or the significantly worse 1650. The full 1660 TI in this laptop can nearly match the performance of 2070 MAX-Q and 2060 GPU's in more expensive laptops. I reduced one star for a couple minor complains: - The screen, while bright and vivid, does have some backlight bleed in the corners. Some have it worse than others, but its acceptable on my device. It doesn't show in games, even in dark areas, and is only really noticeable when booting up. There is also some IPS glow, but that is just a part of using that tech for the screen. - Battery life is pretty bad, even in a low power non-gaming use case. If you need to use this portably without a reliable power source for more than a couple of hours, look elsewhere. - Its loud. If you use 'turbo' to get the max clock speed on the GPU\/CPU, it ramps the fans up to 100% and is audible even through headphones. Luckily, I haven't found a need to use turbo mode yet. Even more demanding VR games run very well on the 'fast' GPU setting. Overall, if you're looking for a mid-range gaming laptop, the helios 300 is by far the best available in the ~$1000 price range.","Pros: Better overall performance for the price Compact design compared with the previous model New dedicated predator sense button, overclocking ready to use 144 fps Nice predator blue lighted icon For sure my next gaming laptop is going to be a predator but with a decent SSD Cons Mine didn't come with the kit to install an additional internal ssd, wrote to acer, no international delivery for that stuff, call local Acer: sorry we can't get the kit... so no internal ssd, but I got an external ssd usb-c, works fine, but acer costumer service... not so good. Of course internal drive 256 GB for gaming... Killernetworking worked good until one day stops, never works again and reinstall it was impossible but I guess I'm a normal guy with this tech things Conclusion: For serious gaming in a budget, get a predator!!","I purchased this to replace my 3 year old gaming laptop that was due for an upgrade. The specs on this unit were an obvious improvement and the price made sense for the performance. I consistently get 50-100% higher FPS playing my standard games. However, I immediately noticed that the monitor had heavy light bleed around the edges when there is a darker image on screen. This is much more distracting than my previous laptops\/monitors have been. Reading online and there appear to be a number of users with similar issues. I'm trying to determine if it's worth a refund at this point.","(UPDATE 11\/4\/2019) - So apparently, the BIOS is rather locked down and limited.  This poses a problem, because you can not change the boot priority.  I took the M.2 out of my old Acer E 15 and planned on formatting it to use in the Predator.  Upon installation and boot up, it actually booted into Windows from the E 15 M.2 drive...NOT the drive that the Predator originally shipped with.  I switched sides, moving the Predator M.2 to the right side M.2 drive and the E 15 M.2 to the left, where the Predator's M.2 was previously located.  Received a BSOD.  Once I removed the 2nd M.2 and put the Predator's M.2 back where it was...it was all good.  So it appears that you can not actually USE that 2nd M.2 drive despite it being empty and ready.  I hooked up a regular 2.5\" SSD in the empty 3.5\" bay and it worked fine, but not being able to install a 2nd M.2 SSD is points OFF for this laptop.  It's not a huge deal, and I will probably just install a 1TB SSD in the 3.5\" bay, but why make it look like you can install a 2nd M.2 if you really can't??  Also, WHY is the BIOS locked down?? I purchased this laptop as a replacement for my Acer E 15.  A serious upgrade indeed, and it was worth every penny (after the 4 year warranty and taxes, it was slightly north of $1300). BUILD QUALITY - Extremely solid.  Aluminum lid, plastic bezel that's thin around screen, but still very sturdy, aluminum keyboard frame, and then a plastic bottom.  Weighs in at around 5lbs.  Despite being a gaming laptop, the aesthetics are much more reserved than its 2018 predecessor.  A simple mat dark grey body with blue accents, light blue backlit keyboard (no RGB on this version), and a blue Predator logo on the lid that lights up. SCREEN - 1920x1080 screen, at 144hz.  If you have never seen games played at 144Hz, it is truly a thing of beauty.  Everything is just so buttery and smooth, it changes the entire dynamic of the games.  Now they could've combined this refresh rate with a higher resolution screen (such as 1440p), but there's no point when the screen you're looking at is on a 15\" laptop.  1080p is more than sufficient, and it really shines here. WEBCAM - 720p...not great..not terrible...better than nothing, but if you truly need something, use an external Logitech webcam. KEYBOARD - Standard chiclet style keys.  They feel good, especially if you like to type and you're used to smaller keys.  The num pad on the right forces things to be a bit condensed, but I'd rather have it than not.  The light blue backlight is nice; far easier on the eyes than red or green.  Again, no RGB on this model, but honestly..I don't miss it.  The keyboard has very little give when pressed down on, thanks to that aluminum body. Keys have a pretty good travel distance.  I bottom out my keys, and I still enjoy typing on this. TRACKPAD - Not sure what others are talking about; this trackpad isn't bad at all.  It's not super sensitive like the on my E 15, and it's pretty smooth.  It's not made of glass, but honestly it's fine. SPECS - Here's the rundown: - i7 9750H Intel chip (2.6Ghz, Turbo takes it up to 4.5Ghz).  It's a workhorse. - GTX 1660TI.  Yeah, the other model has a 2060 in it, but this card's performance isn't very far behind the 2060 at all, and it is far less power hungry, which equates to better temps and thus a prolonged life for the laptop overall.  Fair trade, if you ask me. - 16GB of DDR4 RAM.  This laptop supports up to 64GB, so if you plan on doing some 3D work or editing 4K video, you can upgrade the RAM yourself easily. - 256GB M.2 SSD for your OS.  There's an empty slot for another M.2 and even an empty 3.5\" bay for a 2.5\" SSD, and they include a bracket for installing it.  My Acer E 15 didn't come with one of those, so it's a nice touch here. - Also important to point out...the laptop comes undervolted out of the box at -.125, which definitely helps prevent heat throttling. PORTS - (Left side)  Kensington lock notch, fan exhaust, power adapter port, Ethernet port, and two USB 3.1 ports.  (Right side) Fan exhaust, HDMI port, Mini Display port,  another USB 3.1 port and a USB 3.1 type C port. BATTERY - 3720 mAh battery.  Normal web surfing will get you about 3-4 hours, but gaming is gonna be MUCH less...MAYBE an hour, especially if you're playing at max settings.  The power brick is a slim, so get used to carrying it around if you're on the go. SPEAKERS - Positioned on the bottom.  Nothing special.  I'd suggest headphones....and speaking of which... TURBO - Ups the ante on your device for more performance.  When pressed, the CPU and GPU both get a swift overclock, and the fans SCREAM to handle the extra heat.  No really..they're seriously LOUD..probably the loudest fans I've ever heard on a laptop.  This is good because it keeps the laptop cool, but I'd invest in some good noise-cancelling headphones. GAMES - It'll handle the latest modern titles without breaking a sweat on the highest graphical settings.  That's all you need to know.  I used Unigine to run a benchmark on it, and after pushing the unvolt to -.17, using the Turbo setting, and a cooling pad, the temps were below 60 degrees.  This will change depending on the title you play, how long you play, and whether you have a cooling pad or not. OVERALL - You will NOT find another gaming laptop at this price that performs this well and doesn't suffer heat throttling.  Acer has set the bar pretty high, and for only about $1200.  I'll continue testing and update this review with any new findings, but for now..I'd say buy with confidence for sure.","I purchased this as a replacement for my Alienware 15R3 gaming laptop.  I was expecting a less premium package due to the specs that were being sold at such a low price point, but I was shocked by the quality of this laptop. In almost every measurable way, it is better than my Alienware was.  The screen is brighter (albeit with some noticeable screen bleed at the top), the keyboard feels better, the trackpad is very usable although I use a mouse 99% of the time, and the performance is amazing. As soon as it arrived I opened it up to add a 1TB M.2 SSD, as well as a 2TB 2.5\" SATA drive, both of which were simple to do.  So far, everything has been good to go.  The fan's are a little loud, but no worse than most gaming laptops, and they do their job well. My only complaint would be towards Amazon who shipped it terribly; putting it in a box without packing paper so it was free to bounce around for the whole trip.","Have already had the blue screen of death come up about 4 times in 5 days since using the computer. I installed a Evo 860 1tb internal drive and the first day it was recognized bit soon disappeared and I cannot even see it in the bios. I have checked connections, downloaded new drivers but nothing works. Acer support ran through some troubleshooting but in the end told me to call Samsung and that the Evo 860 is not compatible with this PC which I dont think is correct. Probably why I will not purchase high dollar items from Amazon anymore.","It was a great decision to buy this laptop! It loads Windows in less than 5 seconds. I installed a Western Digital 2TB hard drive which was very easy to install and a great compliment to the 258GB SSD pre-installed. I recommend having Acer install it for you if you don't feel comfortable doing it. I installed Steam on the SSD and everything else on the 2TB HDD. I have been able to run the following games on max settings without any lag: 1. Skyrim Special Edition 2. Microsoft Flight Simulator X 3. Watchdogs 1 4. Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 Those are the ones I have tried so far. I also have the 144Hz enabled. The detail in the graphics is amazing. The only problem I have is the temperature. Expected with gaming laptops, but right after loading Windows and the CPU temperature reached 127 F. After a minute or two it is at 118 F. Not sure why as I am currently only running one google chrome tab which was as I wrote this review. When running games, the temperature reaches around 158 F. This worries me as I do not want to risk causing damage from excessive heat. I have ordered a cooling pad. Hopefully it helps keep the temperature lower. The laptop came by default under-volted, which can be checked with the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility (I recommend backing up settings before using it just in case).","Pros -Great FPS in all games -Great predator sense software (loved adjustable fans and temp monitoring) -Good temps (on max fans; 77-83c average heavy gaming) -144hz screen is nice (although max setting on most AAA titles only get around 75-85 FPS) -color gamut is accurate -Good build quality -thin, light and not super gamey look -Damn Good price per performance ratio -Storage is easily upgradable(YouTube video) -No problems setting up on my device -Good WiFi card -Fast boot up and read speeds (factory nvme) Cons -Some backlight bleed on pitch black screens (not even noticeable for me anymore) -Not the best battery life (only 4-5 hrs of light work; 70% brightness) -Pretty loud fans on max (but does get the job done and I use headphones so not a problem) -Speakers are below average for gaming laptop (again I use headphones so not a problem) The only reason I give the Acer Predator Helios 300 4-stars is that not everyone finds the cons acceptable, personally I would rate this laptop 5-stars. After 3 full months of ownership I can easily say that no problems presented and the laptop has been just the same as out-of-box.","I purchased this laptop in late August. It performs great for the price. However, the customer service is awful. The plastic around the left hinge came loose where the seam is, which caused damage to the plastic when I closed the laptop, and now it can\u2019t be closed without the screen bending. I contacted customer support, they told me it was covered under the warranty, and to send it back for repair. A week later, I get an email telling me that it will cost $699 to fix. That\u2019s almost 70% of the original cost to fix the hinge. I called, and my only two options were pay the fee, or they would send it back to me. They indicated that the hinge was damaged in a fall. The laptop hasn\u2019t left my desk since purchase, so I know this isn\u2019t possible. Incredibly disappointed, but I guess you get what you pay for. I certainly won\u2019t purchase from Acer again.","No doubt this is one of the best ' value for money' product. BUT this thing can't be called a laptop. The battery life in this thing is nonsense. I got 2 hour and 46 minutes not playing games with one google chrome tab open. Performance of the laptop is wonderful. They could have done better with that battery. Acer needs to work on that.","I take back every good thing I said about those laptop it is absolutely horrible I have received two models and both of them had terrible backlight bleed. even when you check one of the number one reviews of the laptop on Amazon one of the pictures that they uploaded is a black image and you can see three white spots on the image is self showing how bad this can be mine were far worse than the pictures shown if you like horror games or anything in black images do not buy this laptop I guarantee you you will receive one with backlight bleed.","After week 1: I'm very happy with this laptop. As a gamer, the performance of speaks to be - the GTX 1660 Ti was well worth the jump from an $800 dollar tier laptop to the $1100 price point. I do not upgrade my laptop often and I plan to buy my next one in 2025. If this laptop conks out before 2022 I'll be revising this review. The performance interface features displaying temperatures etc. is really cool - yeah i'm new to gaming laptops - but it's darn cool. Being my first SSD laptop, it's amazing how quick it is. This laptop multi-tasks really well. It's to be expected with 16GB of RAM and Gen 9 processor. I'll be adding the second hard drive via technician to preserve my warranty. Battery life - the battery life is adequate for general use. If you're gaming it drinks the charge though which is to be expected. Gaming should be done plugged in if you want to witness this beast's power. Well that's my corny review.","Really solid gaming laptop my guys. I got it on prime day. I'm pretty illiterate when it comes to this kind of stuff, but this was for sure a really good bang for your buck. Fan doesn't get too loud, when playing intensive games (modded highest settings Witcher 3), and runs things very smoothly. Turbo mode is also available on this, which adds like an extra 10-15 fps on whatever you're running, downside is it'll sound like a jet engine (kinda expected though). I'm using a cooling pad as well, as it does get pretty hot, so keep that in mind. ALl in all good deal.","Pros- awesome design Better than regular cooling Nice graphics card (works for 2k at 144hz) Light up keyboard Great price 16gb ram so you won\u2019t have to upgrade right away Cons- you will have to buy and add day 1 extra memory( so to me you have to add at least $100 ssd to the price) Cooling system works great but system gets hot fast.(recommend cooling pad) Plastic feels cheaply made on some parts **Has Proprietary software for cooling and over clocking. I would recommend not using anything else but what comes with it. Has boost mode but crashes every time I use it after about 2 mins Overall- great entry laptop for gaming","Absolutely fantastic little rig. Has the horsepower for high frames and good graphics, a monster processor, and a very pleasing form factor. I would say the only downside is the lack of larger storage space, but it's super simple to order another SSD or two. The redesign from the 2018 model is fantastic. Gone is the dated red and black edgy color scheme replaced with a more subdued teal and black. The cooling system was also revamped. I haven't peaked above 72* on my CPU since some mild undervolting. Sitting with a cooling pad in a cool room, I'm at low to mid 60s playing Skyfactory 4 for a few hours. The screen is absolutely stunning as well. The 144hz makes me despise my work screens when I get in for the day. Would absolutely recommend this laptop if you are looking for something easily portable, attratctive, with the horsepower to run whatever you'd like, all at a price no competitor can match.","Best laptop I have ever owned for 999.99 on amazon prime day. Cant complain and it runs like a champ. A little hot at times but that's to be expected form a machine like this. Wish the fans where a little less audible but again its gotta cool off alot.","I have 2 Helios 300: 2017 and 2019. 2019 has better graphics (1660ti vs. 1060) and cpu ( 9750h vs. 7700hq). Also it is physically thinner, lighter, has twice smaller external power  supply. Nice sign on back side of cover. Very reliable - 2 year of using by teen for 2017 model has no any damages\/problems. Really good investment.","I doubt any laptop is going to perform like this beast does, at the same price. Doom (2016) - 120 fps\/Ultra CS:GO - 280 fps\/Ultra the list goes on and on with games that will reach 100+ fps. At those specs you cant expect ANY battery to last long but still manages about an hour and a half of decent gaming. This monster really shines when you plug it in. M.2 NVMe SSD is LOW on capacity but very fast, has an empty bay for another M.2 SSD and an empty bay for a SATA hard drive, i opted for the second SSD. 1TB M.2 NVMe drives are sold cheap on Amazon, avoid Best Buy's prices. I saved and scraped up money hoping to buy the 2017 version of this same laptop, but the responsibility of fatherhood kept me out one till now, i almost caved and bought a used gaming laptop from Craigslist, i am so glad i stayed the course and reached the goal. After seeing what this can do over other laptops, i would have been disappointed indeed if i caved and bought a used one.","En general muy buen productor, pero debo criticar que cuando me llego el paquete venia con una caja grande y dentro la caja de laptop pero no traia ningun tipo de amortiguador y es malo porque a pesar que la caja de la laptop viene protejida de igual forma puede recibir da\u00f1o es mejor que no este bailando la caja de la laptop dentro de la caja, por todo lo demas la maquina tiene un excelente rendimiento."],"33":["I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways. So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed. It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you. This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!","A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..). Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone\/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery. 2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is. The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough. The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive. Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted. A couple of things that annoy me: -The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting... -The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse\/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off. -The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?","A few months after the purchase.... It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money. _____________________ This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain. I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly. What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there. On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything. Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it. After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.","This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop. Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks. The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor. The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop. This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop. Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect. Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1\/3 the money people are spending on nothing. Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem. The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price. I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need. The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured. This boots in about 15 seconds. It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with. This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING. I can't sing the praises of this enough. Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine. Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode. This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.","The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB\/s range. The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy. I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness. Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2. Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666. Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%. Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%. I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though. Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices. I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium. This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .","I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable. I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back. Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up. I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect. I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus! So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.","It runs amazing","This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped. The screen is a solid IPS screen and when you consider the price tag is amazing and beats a lot of the more expensive laptop screens I have seen.","Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too. Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments\/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection\/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board). The rear\/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly\/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places. UPGRADES: I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow. I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with. Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and\/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode. Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer. Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop. For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.","BUYER BE AWARE: This computer has Microsoft 10S. This is scam software by Microsoft to force you to use only Microsoft apps from their deserted island wasteland of an app store. The computer will not allow you to do anything else. You can upgrade to a full version of Microsoft 10... for another $134. Hard pass. STAY AWAY from ALL computers with Microsoft 10S!! Absolute garbage software.","Good entry level laptop. Latest gen ryzen picasso at the time of this review. Good for basic functions at this price point. Comes with m.2 128 gb drive with room for another SSD. Win 10 is a giant pain in the rear, particularly \"S\" mode, which can be opted out of.","It came today and I plugged it in, charged, powered on and did the setup. Walked away for a bit and came back to it with a black screen. I assumed it went to sleep or the screen turned off. The power button does nothing. Blue light is on saying it is charged. Held down power for 45 seconds- nothing. Unplugged from charger and did the same. Waited a bit and called amazon tech who had me repeat the same steps. I\u2019ve now been on hold for 25 minutes while they reach out to acer to see if there is something else they can do. 7\/20 Update: I waited on hold for nearly 40 minutes while the Amazon tech stated she was on hold with acer. She came back after and said that she couldn\u2019t reach them despite their call center being 24 hours but would call me at 5pm on Friday.  Friday and I did not receive a call.  I checked hours later to see she had sent an email and told me to call Acer directly. By this time it\u2019s late and I have plans. I therefore called Acer this morning. Anytime the computer is left on without using for 30 minutes it freezes - resetting the battery doesn\u2019t help- the power button just doesn\u2019t work and it has to sit for 24 to reset itself. They suspect a display, charger or battery issue and offered to send me a shipping label as I can\u2019t print anything without a working computer. As I\u2019ve had this computer for less than two days and it had issues within hours I advise that I will be returning to amazon for a replacement. Amazon tells me it\u2019ll be days before I get my replacement. Hopefully it works! Now I do remember why I bought my last computer at a store - is there\u2019s ever an issue they can replace it the same day and have techs on staff that don\u2019t just try to pass the issue along.","I bought this laptop for its weight and that's about the only thing positive I can say about it. The processing power is not very strong, so performance-wise, I was not impressed. But with the pricetag considered, I'm all right with this. However, the biggest thing for me is the OS- WINDOWS 10-IN S MODE. I had never heard of S Mode, and I didn't notice this when I bought the laptop. Apparently, S Mode is Microsoft's way of ensuring that you only use their apps and products by blocking you from downloading any outside apps. You have to get them all through their store. So, for example, were I to try to download Norton's anti-virus from Norton's official site, Microsoft's S Mode would tell me that I am unable. Any and all files outside of their store are blocked from being downloaded. In order to leave S Mode, you have to change it in the settings, but then you have to use a registration key for Windows 10 Home or Pro. So I shelled out another $130 just to get a fully functioning OS. Factor that price into this laptop price. THEN- after purchasing Windows 10 Home, I had to keep trying over the course of 4 days for the laptop to accept me switching out of S Mode because Microsoft was conveniently having server errors on their side and so my request could not be processed at this time. This is a common issue, at least from what I read among those discussing S Mode on Reddit forums. Multiple people report that Microsoft has server issues when you try to opt out of S Mode. Very very unhappy with this laptop for the sole reason that the OS is Windows 10 in S Mode. It was inconvenient and one of the most useless things I have ever seen pre-installed on a computer. Created a major and unnecessary headache for me.","Pros: - Price-performance ratio: Good. Smooth and fast enough for web surfing, streaming video watching, normal office software working, etc. - IPS LCD panel: Viewing angles (up\/down and left\/right) are pretty wide (a lot wider than TN panel). Screen brightness is very good. - Keyboard: Backlit is very convenient. Typing feel is very good. Separated numeric keypad is good. However, separated\/dedicated 'Home\/End\/Pg Up\/Pg Dn' keys next to numeric keypad are needed though. - Expandability: Memory(RAM) is expandable to 32GB (2 x 16GB DDR4 SODIMM, PC4-21300, 2666Mhz, 260 pins). There is an empty 2.5\" SATA slot for additional storage device. - Aluminum top cover: Premium looks and durable. - Weight (3.97 lbs): Considerably light for 15.6\" screen. Cons: - Product finishing\/cosmetic condition\/build quality: The aluminum top cover does not fit snug with the LCD bezel especially edges. Edges have gaps. One of the bottom edges has scratches\/silver paint was peeled off. Quality control should pay more attention. - Touch pad: Cheap loosen plastic feel. Every touch makes noise. - No 'CAPS Lock' and 'Numeric Key Lock' indicator lights: Very inconvenient. - No Memory Card slot. - No USB-C port. - Sound: Not loud enough. Right side speaker is weaker than left even though Windows volume levels of both channels are exactly same. - Battery life: 7.5 hours in the advertisement is a joke. Lasts about 5.5 hours top with Battery Saver On and lowest Screen Brightness level. 3.5-4.5 hours only for normal web surfing with 2 or 3 tabs. - Charging plug and port: Quite hard to connect. - CPU fan noise: Somewhat annoying.","I'm really loving this computer so far!  It's slim, lightweight, and folds flat -- which is needed for me for work since I carry my laptop around a lot.  The battery life is really long, I love how bright the screen is, and my favorite thing so far is the keyboard.  Ever sit down at a new computer\/keyboard, and it takes you some adjustment to learn how to type on it without hitting the wrong keys?  Not with this laptop -- there was zero learning curve, and I'm typing 100wpm as always with zero adjustment period. I panicked at first and thought I was going to return it because Chrome wouldn't download, but false alarm!  I turned off Microsoft's S Mode, and I was good to go.  I work from this machine, and all of my applications are Chrome-based or in MS Office.  Works perfectly and fast.  Loving it so far! ONLY complaint is it came with a lot of extra software.  But I spent about 10mins in the add\/remove programs, deleted it all, restarted, and I'm good to go.","For my usage, this laptop fits the bill. I got it on Prime Day for $290 after tax. Here are my first impressions: Pros: \u2010VERY LIGHTWEIGHT for a 15.6 inch laptop - Colors are very saturated - Sleek exterior (pictures above) - Decent battery life (about 6.5 hours) - Great performance overall Cons: -Only 4gb ram out of the box ( I took the bottom panel off and installed Crucial 8GB 260-Pin DDR4 SO-DIMM DDR4 2666 (PC4 21300) Memory Model CT8G4SFS8266. -Keypad makes loud noises when clicked on -128 GB ssd's, with about 98gb after set up. There is an empty slot for an internal hard drive when you take off the bottom panel. - Sound isn't very loud when turned up all the way I mainly use this laptop for school work (I'm in college) and is within my budget. It's very portable and can take abuse if it's coming in and out of a backpack.","We purchased this product for my son\u2019s birthday.  As he starts playing with it, we realize it\u2019s in safe mode and he\u2019s not able to download or open the products he wants to use.  Microsoft says it\u2019s a glitch in their system and we need to wait for them to work it out.  Amazon says they will replace with another unit, but they can\u2019t guarantee that unit won\u2019t have the same issue.  So, here we are with a brand new computer, unused.  Huge let down.  Disappointing product with disappointing options to make it right.","Thin and light. Aluminum case looks good. The system run smoothly with ssd. The original ram is samsung 2666 4gb. I upgraded ram with other brand and still ok. sata is empty.","Can't imagine a better laptop out there. I was looking for something under 400 for years but never made a purchase because I have my own requirements: good speed, full HD (1080p), IPS screen, backlit keyboard, and light weight. Now eventually I can get rid of my 2011 Macbook (which I run it on windows so Mac system is not what I want), because this one is so good and so cheap especially on Amazon Prime day. As a former veteran engineer worked for the biggest electronics company, I wanted to remind people DRAM is commodity. Don't worry about brand. Just go buy from one of the reputable makers including Samsung, Hynix, and Micron, and I strongly recommend 2400 instead of 2666. I know the OEM RAM is 2666 but it REALLY does't matter. 2666 is the highest clock the OEM will support, but this CPU can only run up to 2400 MHz. When clock is 2400 both RAM have zero difference, but the current prices for both speed are different. In terms of SSD slot upgrade, I would recommend Samsung's EVO which is definitely the best out there. Most reliable and fastest in its class. If you have budget concern, WD blue or Crucial MX500 are good alternatives. Definitely stay away from Samsung QVO and WD green, and of course you don't want to buy from any small brands and risk losing data.","Computer works well, no complain. It only has like three weeks with me, but since the very first day I have used it almost 15 hrs a day in project. The only thing it just surprised me, its I bought this on prime day offers as my old computer died the week before. I was actually recommending it to a colleague and opened my order to tell him how much I paid. It was 438.26 minus the discounts (Deals of the day!) plus 20 us of taxes I ended paying 372.25. Today the computer on regular price is 309.99 US!!! yes three weeks after, not on super amazon prime day of the year bla bla bla\u2026. I have learned a leason, I wont trust this offers again.....computer is good though","The things that set this laptop apart from others in the price range are latest generation Ryzen mobile processor, IPS screen, Nvme M.2 SSD, These are features found in much more expensive laptops. The one weak point is the amount of RAM at only 4GB, however that is easily remedied by adding another stick of ram to the laptop after buying it. Adding Ram to the system is fairly easy. There are 10 screws on the bottom panel you need to remove, then gently pry out the back cover with a guitar pick or other thin and rigid plastic device. I used an old credit card. This will open the bottom of the laptop, and then you can access the RAM socket to install additional memory. You can also add a secondary hard drive , or replace the m.2 SSD drive with one of a larger capacity. When you first unbox the laptop, Be prepared to run windows update, as the new feature update to windows takes quite a while to download and install. Initial available space on the SSD drive out of the box was around 90gb free. After running windows update that dropped down to around 67gb free space. I was able to get the free space back up to 87gb by running the disk cleanup wizard and removing old windows setup files from the feature update. Also, be sure to go to the AMD website, and download the Ryzen \/ Radeon driver package, as they are updated regularly, and work better than what was on it from the factory. cold boot time to desktop on this device is extremely fast. You will love the responsive nature of this laptop. Considering the prime day price I picked this up at, the value was top notch.","I genuinely have no complaints about this laptop, but I'll try to list some \"negatives\" for those who want to hear whatever bad news is available before deciding on their purchase. -The trackpad is a little \"wobbly\", this doesn't impact functionality in any way, but I've noticed it doesn't sit firmly in place during usage. -I maxed out the 4gb RAM pretty quickly, but that's after a few dozen tabs on Chrome while having some other programs opened in the background. If you're a \"power user\", you're gonna wanna add another stick of RAM. I bought another 4gb RAM stick off an auction site for $15 shipped. -110gb of the 128gb is free to use out the box, that remaining 18gb is presumably a recovery partition for Windows. Like every other Windows machine ever. -The integrated GPU is good for 30fps, 720p, low\/medium settings gaming. It's good if you want to game in a pinch, I guess. -The speakers suck. Ok, this might be my only real complaint. I wasn't expecting the Trans-Siberian Orchestra to be embedded in this laptop, and I guess the provided speakers are better than reading lips, but you're better off using headphones 9.9\/10 times. Everyone else already listed the pros ad nauseum, and they're not wrong. 1080p IPS display looks fantastic for a laptop, 128gb NVMe SSD is wicked fast, and there's a spot for a SATA 2.5\" drive if you want to add extra storage to the laptop. The integrated graphics chip is extremely impressive for the amount of power it draws, I would put its graphical prowess on par with the Xbox 360. For basic computing, this laptop is going to be more than enough. I tried to stress the laptop by playing some genuine 4k content off my hard drive (1:1 4k BDs), while having some Chrome tabs opened, and this laptop handled that like a champ. To sum it up, unless you're attempting to render Pixar's next film or trying to break military-grade encryption by brute force, this laptop will be just fine.","I received it today. It has manufacture date of June this year. First and most important: Windows S mode. Can it be switched out to Windows Home Edition? YES. I've read some guy's review that says Acer and Amazon told him to pay $100 to upgrade. So I was very hesitant to order this unit. But once you go to windows upgrade page, it will tell you this copy of windows cannot be activated. So I freaked out. But do this: patiently update software. A few times. If you getting the unit now, it will update entire windows system 64x twice. But just update and restart few times. THEN GO TO THE SAME PAGE (WINDOW ACTIVATION). Then you will see the link and warning to switch to WINDOWS HOME. Go to Windows App store. Then just FREE (switch) button. It won't take long but it will basically switch instantly. So I'm attaching that paper came in the box assuring it can be switched out. And it did. This is 8\/9\/2019. Second thing: I immediately went to YOUTUBE to play 1080p. It WORKS FINE. I didn't even try 1440P or 4K. This AMD Thing being similar to i3 version, it will have hiccup. Didn't even try. Screen: Crisp. Matte Crisp. No blurry fonts. Just great. I love it. Keyboard: great. Page down and Enter at the numeric pad is just awesome. Tactile feel real solid. SO CONCLUSION: JUST BUY IT!","This is a decent laptop for the price, good battery life, nice and quick to do what you want to do. I will say, I have a few gripes about this machine, though. 1. Windows 10 S Mode. This is supposed to be more secure, but limits you to only downloading Microsoft sponsored apps from their store. You can turn this off and switch to the Home Edition, and it was the first thing I did. 2. They lied on the RAM. It is advertised as 4GB of DDR4, and it's only 3GB, as shown by the program Speccy, which pulls up detailed info about your device. 3. I have reason to believe this isn't an IPS display, as I had issues with side-angle viewing, and Speccy has detected a generic plug-n-play monitor. All in all, you get what you pay for, but I really didn't expect such blatant false advertising from a well-known company.","The laptop I received for this review was opened prior to me actually opening it. I do not know if this was a return or something but I tested it out anyways. Based on normal use I say this is OK with the exception of some weird glitching in which the laptop screen momentarily turns all black. It has happened around three times already. I was just using it for browsing and video watching. It has only been a couple of days of use and this is already happening. Something is wrong with this but I am no techie so I don't know what. I did the usual troubleshooting...turn it off and on again. It didn't fix the problem. Beside this, the screen is really nice to look at. The bezels are thin which makes the viewing of shows wonderful. The screen is more matte than glassy which I find that I prefer compared to the glossy screen on my Asus (which performs way better than the Acer one without a question since mine is super expensive). The keyboard is easy to type and the layout of it is useful in that they had enough space to put a full number pad to the right. The power button threw me off because it wasn't at the side of the laptop it was found on the keyboard itself (upper right). Lasting capabilities is around 5-6 hours of continuous usage for me. But battery life is really dependent on the individual.","I ordered this Acer Aspire 5 Slim laptop on prime day. The AMD Ryzen 3 3200U CPU packs a good amount of processing in its two cores and two threads per core. When I received my unit, I went through the Windows 10 mini setup.  The system ran fine in the provided Windows 10. I decided to install my operating system of choice which is Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS Desktop 64 bit edition.  In my experience, I found that the Acer Aspire 5 FLIES in Ubuntu or any Linux for that matter in comparison with Windows. Interestingly, I installed VirtualBox so that I could see how the Ryzen 3 3200U would handle virtualization. As it turns out, my Windows 10 virtual machine somehow ran even better than the shipped Windows 10. I also created virtual machines for Elementary OS and the new Linux Mint 19.2 beta. Both those VMs booted in seconds and performed well. If you plan on using virtual machines much with this laptop, I would add memory. The system comes with a single memory stick that is 4GB. There are two memory slots and if you have two matched memory sticks, they would takes advantage of dual channel memory access which might speed the system even more. In my tests, Libre Office writer and calc both launched from scratch in under 4 seconds. I installed both Firefox and Chrome on my Ubuntu and they are both very snappy. I used both the wired Ethernet and also the wireless card which I connected via 802.11ac and it performed very well. The only downside that I found with this system is the touch pad. The touch pad is very large and is impossible to avoid while typing on the keyboard and so I had a lot of typing corrupted by false hits on the touch pad. I finally turned the touch pad off via the Ubuntu mouse control panel and used an external mouse and the problem was solved. This is NOT a gaming machine by any means. It is an excellent machine for web surfing, document editing and email though. I found that the battery is good for almost 3 hours and charges very quickly. This system was well worth the price and is a welcome addition to my home computing environment.","Just abominable, at the absolute worst time in my life possible... Things kept not working, I kept calling customer service, barely intelligible robotic people kept telling me I needed to reset the hard drive and wipe out everything I'd put on it (again). Final straw was the touchpad suddenly stopped working - after an agonizing 2 hours on the phone, conclusion was a hardware problem, no choice but to return it. Also, the sound is WAY too soft - I tried all these \"fixes\" I found online, nothing helped. Why would you need \"fixes\" for something so basic as acceptable sound in 2019?? Went to Best Buy, the dude just winced when I told him I had bought an Acer. DO NOT BUY. I hardly ever bother to review products one way or the other, but I owe this one to you.","this machine kept telling me that i am underage. could not find the windows product code. 4 amazon people just made it worse. i don't know what is wrong but it is driving me out of my mind.","Even at the non-Prime Day price, this laptop is still a solid contender in the \"budget\" arena of laptops.  My family purchased 3 and we are all quite happy with them.  It's lightweight, thin and comes packed with the essential features most non-gamers need to work and play.  Plus, it looks great! For the low price, you do give up a few premium features, such as a better CPU, USB-C ports, a large battery and lots of memory and storage.  However, the beautiful 1080p IPS screen, full keyboard layout, spaciousa and responsive touchpad, USB 3.1 ports and stereo speakers easily cover the basics and then some. Plus, memory and hard drive space can be easily upgraded for very little cost, making it possible to match the features of more expensive models without the price tag. The Ryzen 3 processor is plenty fast for most users and the onboard graphics are better than the graphics on Intel's competing i3 and i5 processors.  That said, this laptop does benefit greatly from a small memory upgrade for both speed and graphics performance.  Simply adding a second 4GB stick of DDR4 2400 or 2666 RAM to the free slot inside is all most users will need to get the most out of this laptop. If you plan on gaming heavily, you may want to look elsewhere, as that's not the strength of this particular model.  But, for basic photo\/video editing and daily tasks like web browsing, spreadsheets and word processing, the Ryzen cpu with a low-cost 4GB memory upgrade is more than adequate. For users who need more internal storage, Acer has left a slot open inside the laptop which allows a 7mm thick 2.5\" SSD to be added at any time.  With prices falling on SSDs in the 256GB-512GB range, this is a welcome feature and a simple plug-n-play upgrade. Battery life is less than advertised.  Expect around 4 hours of continuous use, compared to the 7+ the manufacturer claims.  I'm assuming the battery can be upgraded to a better one at a later time, since it's easily accessible when the back cover is removed.  However, don't be put off when you find yourself plugging in for a recharge a little sooner than expected.  It's still \"average\" compared to most other laptops. Sound is decent, but not stellar.  Similarly, the trackpad feels a bit \"cheap\" when pressing at the edges, but it works very well and the response is really good overall. All in all, this is a great basic laptop out of the box and just a few dollars put into a couple small upgrades can really go a long way toward maximizing its performance and functionality. Highly recommended!","I rarely review products but figured this may be helpful to some. For starters, some background context: I am in my mid-20s and have long since finished uni. I am not a gamer. I primarily use my laptop(s)\/tablets for streaming shows\/movies; occasionally working from home; and crafting\/design editing. I used to go through every iteration of a MacBook but, while nice, soon found myself not really utilizing all of its features & could no longer justify its price-point (especially since I do still have an iPhone). This laptop is a STEAL for ~$300. I did my research and honestly, like a majority of the other reviews here said, the Acer Aspire 5 blows every other product in its price bracket out of the water. That said, I went into this fully knowing I wanted an inexpensive laptop and that, because of that constraint, whatever I ended up purchasing would most likely have some limitations. If you purchased this and are disappointed about the specs in correlation to it being ~$300.... I really don't know what to tell you other than that you definitely were looking in the wrong place. I solely bought this computer because I recently got a CRICUT Explore Air 2 and needed something compatible with it (Chromebooks won't work and my MacBook is so old it can barely handle the newest OS); however, I already know now that this is going to become my main laptop and I will get a lot of use from it outside of just crafting. THE IMPORTANT STUFF: 1.) This is a solidly-built laptop. Very sturdy, very lightweight. Perfect for on-the-go. It IS aluminum though the whole way around, so I recommend buying a case or sleeve to avoid scratching. 2.) The screen resolution and sound quality is surprising very good, crisp, and clean - while I think perhaps it could be a tad bit brighter, that's just me being nit-picky. I would still recommend using external speakers if you want to retain the quality of sound at its loudest setting, especially if what you listen to is bass-heavy. 3.) Turning off Windows S-Mode was absolutely painless - it's literally just going to the website that's taped on the outside of the box and clicking one or two buttons. 4.) Like other reviewers recommended, I did purchase another 8GB of RAM and installed it myself (I googled YouTube videos on how to do this for this specific laptop model; there are plenty of them, just take it slow and you'll be fine). I opted to leave IN the 4GB stick that was already there, thus giving myself a total of 12GB RAM. The difference in speed is HUGE and, like I said, I'm not using this for *too* much other than everyday use. Spend that little bit of extra money if you can, I promise it's worth it! I can't speak to anything as to whether it would hold-up with gaming, but definitely for a solid several hours of streaming content, crafting, and\/or having multiple tabs & apps open simultaneously. 5.) The track-pad is VERY sensitive. Not so much so that I would take off a star, but enough to notice. I recommend purchasing a wireless mouse if you plan on doing more intricate work to eliminate any annoyance or mistakes. I bought one (a Logitech one, $10) and so far it's definitely made designing and editing much easier. It's been awhile since I've had a PC but it's nice to know that a lot of its shortcomings (such as memory space & speed) can easily be fixed and modified to your preference. Again, at the end of the day, this is NOT a heavyweight laptop, both literally and figuratively speaking, but that's okay because it's not meant to be! Overall, I would highly recommend this computer to anyone who is looking for an everyday laptop that is both budget-friendly without sacrificing too much of its quality.","We are average users, not hard core gamers. For someone that runs a few light to medium programs, photo\/video editing, streaming, school work, etc., this computer has what it takes. Tried Macbooks, which are great, but 2 to 3 times the price of this Acer. Our criteria was we wanted LED backlit HD screen, backlit keyboard, aluminum shell\/case, attractive, full Qwerty keyboard with numeric keypad, good battery life, fingerprint reader, ample ports with HDMI, light weight, slim bezel,  and fast. Lastly, it had to be within a budget of under $600. This Acer meets all we wanted. There's nothing wrong with conventional HDD if you know how to take care of your machine. By that I mean, KEEP IT CLEANED! Acer, in its infinite wisdom, pre-installed a utility called ACER CARE CENTER. In this single utility you can defrag, clean out the junk, clean the disk, check health of battery, hard drive, etc. Use it! Some have complained their Acer is slow. Have you cleaned it? Expect to spend the first 3 or 4 hours just getting all the Windows 10 updates installed. After just that, I ran the Acer Care utility to find the hard drive was 28% fragmented, and disk needed to be cleaned. So, defragged and cleaned, then went on to add our many programs. When all done with everything, defragged and cleaned again. It boots up in 15 seconds. Battery life on any laptop is dependent upon the programs and use. Don't expect 10 hours. 5 to 7 hours of word processing, surfing, video\/photo editing, and some streaming. Even at current sale price of $349 it's still worth it. Guess time will tell if it holds up, but initially it is a superb laptop with great specs for the money!","This laptop was purchased as a \u201ctoy\u201d for my husband who has over 40 years experience building and tweaking computer systems, mainframe, slave units, desktops and \u201cother stuff\u201d, military and civilian applications. Before first boot, he removed the 4 GB memory stick and replaced it with one Crucial 16GB Single DDR4 2666 MT\/s (PC4-21300) DR x8 SODIMM 260-Pin Memory - CT16G4SFD8266. Get that one only he said, I no longer bother to ask why because I know what he elects to use will \"save time\". I grabbed a 2.5-inch SSD on Prime Day for only $16.75, after 3 minutes of hubby attempting install, \u201csomethings wrong with the fit\u201d. We elected to install later. Comments on properly installing the SSD are welcome. The first boot went quick and smooth. First mission; remove that Windows S. Clicked on the Microsoft store icon then searched for \u201cSwitch Windows S\u201d, a few seconds later Windows S was removed from the computer. After several hours of installing and running applications, this laptop performed better than our others purchased at double the cost just two years ago. Despite the difficulties attempting to install the SSD, my expert says; It's A Solid Amazon Five Star\u201d, \"The best bang for the buck this planet\". My opinion; If while wearing your fancy sunglasses indoors the laptop screen malfunctions, take your fancy glasses off and all will work OK.  :-)","It freezes while you are using it.  It does not support games","Beware of Windows 10s. I\u2019ve been on live chat with Microsoft for 4 hours trying to install Windows 10 home! I have no idea about the computer yet, but the safe mode is a huge problem!","So I bought this laptop during prime day at a great price. Looking to low end game. Pros: Got it at a great price on Prime Day. Great looking screen for the price. Very thin and lightweight no noticeable difference from my chromebook. Decent computer that upgrades well. Add some ram and it does some decent low end gaming. The NVMe SSD is very quick many of the low end laptops don't have this yet. 2 ram slots for dual channel many low ends only have 1. Cons: Ram runs at 2400 not 2666 don't believe the Acer reps here I have tested it myself with multiple sticks including the one that came with the laptop. Needs more ram for what I needed. If you just want to browse the internet and watch streams its ok. Keyboard back lighting looks bad some keys are much brighter then others I bothers me. No easy way to get to the ram battery or drives. Small SSD but I get what I pay for My goals are to be able to play some Classic World of Warcraft. Not raiding but auction house professions and a easy quest or two during down time at work. I must also be able to tab out quickly to my work spreadsheets and pricing sites. I know for sure the amount of ram would not do for what I wanted and would need to be upgraded and I had included this into my pricing thoughts. I went with 16gb ddr4 2666 cl15 for about $73. A little overkill but 8gb would be pushing it with all my work stuff needing to be open and ready at anytime and 2gb being reserved for graphics.  Being a Ryzen and integrated graphics it gets good use of the higher quality ram 2666 (15cl vs 18 or 19cl) so I splurged a extra $10 for. stock ram included was listed at 19cl for anyone that cares. I know classic wow is not a intense game but its really hard to find out how bad a laptop you can get and have it run bare minimum settings. I was looking at the E5-576G-5762 for about $599 and I would still want to up the ram in that but looking to save some money on a laptop I would only use twice a week really I decided to give this a try after much research. So for Team Fight Tactics I am getting 60 to 100 fps late game full teams can bring it down but its stays over 90 for the most part. Classic WoW I am currently playing with 1080p settings 3 (the classic like setting) getting from 60 to 120 fps while I can't test a raid yet I have only been able to use this for the stress test. moving up to settings 4 lowers the fps to 40 to 70 range. I am currently at 80% used of the SSD with only wow, classic wow, league of legends and a benchmark app installed. I would probably install a few more games just to test out but no space for now. Guess that will need upgraded at some point but honestly other then discord I don't plan to have anything else on here. Having a NVMe SSD even if it is small is still amazing for booting and main use stuff.","Expect to find this PC packed with useless bloatware from Microsoft and its partners; and a processors that's slow even for simple web browsing (slow page loads; difficulty doing 2 things at once).  The screen and keyboard are decent enough, but even for a relatively low price I am disappointed and may return this PC.","Get that Samsung 4GB RAM stick you see in the recommended section - it'll LITERALLY double this laptop's performance due to how dual channel memory SIGNIFICANTLY improves BOTH Ryzen AND APU (Vega) performance. Just do it. Next off, this laptop is the bees knees in every possible way except for the trackpad BUT I have a solution to that as well! USE A MOUSE! :P Just kidding but not really. Double tap and drag = drag a window, make a selection. Single Tap = Left Click Two fingers single tap = right click 3 or 4 finger swipe motion = completely customizable actions (minimize, volume, mute, snap window, ect. ) Forget about clicking entirely - that's where this trackpad SUUUUCKS. It has the Microsoft Precision driver so it's not the driver (probably) but it DOES sometimes just think you're using one more finger than you are. >-> Probably my fault somehow. Thus far this change has made this trackpad more than usable - I'm a developer with a beefy workstation, 4K display, S i C K G a M i N G logitech wireless mouse and keyboard... buzzwords ? And thus far this laptop has been more than enough for \"when I don't want to be at my desk\" work. It's actually been so nice that now I Just use this laptop instead of my workstation when I'm not working (: AND OH MY GOD THE DISPLAY! DUDE!!!! I have a Spyder 5 and I didn't even bother. This blows everything I've ever owned out of the water - including my \"professional grade IPS display\" that I calibrated via said Spyder. If you're looking for a laptop, this is it. It can play any \"last gen\" game - so Rocket League, Skyrim, Minecraft - at high settings 60fps nbd and generally anything that's been ported to mobile (Fortnite) will run at 60fps at low settings. I will say this again: Your performance will be LITERALLY cut in half without that $14 stick of RAM. Just get the stupid thing. Don't be a dipstick. Don't believe me? Look up the benchmarks for this laptop. The CPU cores communicate over the RAM and so do the APU cores. Slowing down traffic by half also slows down *EVERYTHING* by half because it's going to be the bottleneck once performance otherwise maxes out - and with 2 cores it will max out quickly with games. That said, the desktop isn't dead. If you're looking to run games primarily - or you at least know that that's something you want to do - and those games aren't last gen - I'd strongly recommend building a PC. Using PCPartPicker or just posting a thread on Reddit you can have your PC parts purchased pretty quickly and building - even if you're illiterate - will take about 2 hours tops. The real time WITH EXPLANATIONS videos on YouTube take 20 minutes. It's easier than legos. You'll be fine. Hope this all helps!","Pros of this machine:  It is indeed much faster than my old laptop.  The screen quality is very good.  The backlit keyboard is nice.  It is also VERY light, and that is great. Cons so far (3 days):  There is no light on the keyboard to tell you when cap lock or num lock are on.  I found this to be a problem straight out of the box setting it up when I couldn't tell what were the capital letters in the password I was putting in!  Secondly, a good bit of the set up involved telling Microsoft exactly how I want them to spy on me, but not giving me any options of not being spied on.  My millenial daughter says people don't care about this any more, but I find it offensive that MS thinks they have the right to know everything I do on my computer and to put ads on it at their whim.  I only get to choose whether I want them personalized or not.  My word. It's none of their business! Thirdly, when I tried to install the program from my job that I bought this computer to use, of course it wouldn't install because of S mode.  When I told it I wanted out of S mode it told me I had to go to the MS Store and buy MS Home for $139!!  My thanks to all the other reviewers who said I could get out of S mode for free.  I finally googled it and MS's own website had the directions I needed.  Note that when I went into settings it was telling me the computer couldn't activate Windows in big red letters.  I had to respond to that first before the \"Switch out of S Mode\" prompts appeared, but I finally did manage to get out of it. So, good basic computer, but be prepared to give up your privacy and go through some minor hassle in setting it up.","As someone who typically builds their own desktop PCs, i am pleasantly surprised with this laptop. I got this aspire 5 during the prime day sale where it was 260$, and even at its normal price of 306$ its really solid. Acer has videos on youtube that show you how to add an additional hard drive, so that was helpful. I put in a 1TB SSD and another 8GB of ddr4 sodimm ram. There were 2 slots for ddr4 sodimm ram, so I think you could potentially get 16GB total ram in this laptop if you had two 8GB sticks. When i had the laptop open, it APPEARED AS IF you could take out the 128GB PCIE NVME SSD that ships with the laptop and put in a larger one, so that's an idea. I mainly got this laptop to use to play everquest (a very old computer game), and do some light web browsing etc,  and have as a laptop that i can carry around without worrying about dropping a 4000$ laptop on the ground. It has an ethernet port, usb 3.1 ports, hdmi port, etc, so thats convenient compared to my macbook (which only has thunderbolt 3 ports and requires dongles or adapters for everything). The backlit keys are great and the keyboard feels good. If you dont like how the function key operates and you use the F1-F12 keys a lot, you can spam F2 while the computer is restarting and go into the BIOS and change the function key behavior. I am still getting a feel for the battery life so i cant comment too much on that, but the battery lasts a while and it seems to take about 2-3 hours to charge it empty to full. It ships with windows 10 S mode which sucks, you can go to the windows store and \"switch out\" of S mode for the regular windows 10 home operating system. Overall i am really loving this laptop, it was very affordable, easily upgradeable hard drive and memory, and it is working great.","First of all, the screen is gorgeous!!  Nice color and great resolution.  Not many low to medium end laptops have 1920x1080 displays, it's REALLY hard to find. For some people the memory and SSD drive might be an issue since they are both a little skimpy, but I purchased a M.2 NVMe 500gig SSD to replace it here on Amazon for 59.99, and upgraded the memory to 8gig  for another $19.99 For stuff like word processing, spreadsheets and web browsing, this is plenty fast.  I ran Photoshop CS6 on it and it's plenty speedy enough for that task even. At work, I have access to Dell laptops that are over 4 times the price of this, and I prefer this laptop to any of them. ** Update **  I've been using this for just a month now, and I can't say enough about how much I love this laptop!! Everything I do on it is plenty fast. The only thing I wish it had was a built in SD card reader.","Out of the box, this is a beautiful laptop. I felt how light it was and I thought to myself, there's no way I can get performance out of this thing. Turned it on and set up and the first thing I did was download World of Warcraft. It downloaded fast. It runs at about medium settings out of the box. I upgraded the SSD to a 900gb and put another stick of ram in and I can run *WoW* on high settings! Load screens zip by. I also tested on call of duty and fortnite and everything ran smoothly. This is the best bang for your buck, in my opinion. Put $100 into it and it's a beast! The screen is very clear as well and is very hd. The keys light up like a gaming computer and makes it easy to see the keys. The only downside to this laptop is the keyboard. I took some pictures of it. It's the number pad and the enter key. It's not a full number pad or enter key. Sometimes I hit the wrong keys due to this. It's minor, I'll be gaming on a different keyboard anyways! Enjoy!!! Buy it and don't look back!","I wanted to love this laptop. It's an outstanding bargain, by far the best in its price range. It's elegant, well equipped for the price with a good display, and expandable with room for more memory and an additional SSD (both are very cheap now). I had trouble with the touchpad, which required a tap vs a click. But I had to RETURN it because of the horrible Windows 10s, which only uses software from the Microsoft store. I spent hours trying to switch it to real Windows home, supposedly \"easy\" to do. I'm pretty technically qualified. But although I did switch it, the first Windows update switched it BACK to 10s irrevocably. 10s is just not usable for much more than web browsing.","I started searching for a new laptop to replace my Dell turd. I only knew I wanted a SSD, and a lighted keyboard for sure. I came across this model and went back and forth for days on whether to purchase or not. I really didn't think I could buy a good laptop for $314. I was prepared to spend $600 or better to get what I wanted when I started searching. After reading multiple reviews on Amazon and other sites. I pulled the trigger. I absolutely could not be happier with it. I ordered 8gb of extra Ram when I bought it, but I am considering sending it back. This little thing is super snappy. I may add a second SSD down the road for more storage, but it is good to go for now. I am using for email, web surfing, and streaming and it is flawless. As for Windows 10 S mode, I disabled that in about 20 seconds after getting it set up. It boots from off, in about 15 seconds. If you are still reading this, just buy it and be amazed like I am.","This is a nice laptop for the price, and it's very easy to upgrade the ram and add a second hard drive. Converting from Windows S mode to Home is also very easy. If you decide to order a second hard drive to upgrade it, be aware that you MUST order a drive that is 7mm thick. I originally ordered a 1 TB mechanical drive to install, based on an Amazon recommendation, and it was a 9.5mm drive. On the Acer website it clearly indicates that this laptop only supports 7mm secondary drives. I ended up installing a 7mm SSD and an additional 4GB of ram, and now it's blazing fast. I highly recommend this laptop. Update: Not as enthused as I was originally about this machine for these reasons: 1. Although it has a keypad on the keyboard, the system HOME, END, Page Up\/down keys are tied to the keypad which means if you use the keypad on spreadsheets a lot, you can't jump around using Home and End keys - a real bummer if your job involves lots of spreadsheets like mine. IF I had known that I would have passed on this laptop. 2. I installed an extra 4 GB ram, but the system kept reporting only 5.9 GB Ram is usable. Defective Ram - I thought. Went ahead and slapped 16 GB Ram into it, but now using Speccy and Windows reopt only 13.9 GB is usable. Apparently, this is a known issue on Acer laptops with Ryzen and AMD graphics. The system seems to reserve 3 GB (give or take) for graphics and other stuff. To me, that's unacceptable and if I had known that I would have passed on it. IT is a nice machine. I like the build quality, the graphics are very good, etc. but this Ram issue is a bummer. If you are considering buying this machine, paste this into your Google machine: Aspire A515-43 usable ram less than installed - and see for yourself. It's a known issue and there isn't a real fix for it. Now I have extra memory I don't need adding another $30 to the price of this machine. Caveat Emptor leads to a 2 star deduction. See images for Windows system Ram report.","The battery life seems like it could be better, but it isn't horrible. I'm still messing with screen brightness settings to see if that makes a difference. I'll update this if it becomes a five star product. So, you want to install Linux? You probably won't be able to enable Legacy Boot, so discard that option if youtube and google told you to try that, unless your BIOS is somehow different from mine. You will need to: 1) Google how to make a bootable USB compatible with UEFI, then get your Linux ISO burned onto the USB. 2) Turn on your Acer and hit F2 right after the first splash screen to access the BIOS options 3) Setup a Supervisor Password (If you want it blank, I think it can be blank. Or make it something easy to remember and go back and change it to an empty field.) 4) Step 3 allows you to turn off Secure Boot. Look for it in the menus and do it. 5) Enable F12 boot menu (this allows you to select a USB to boot from). This is also in the menus. 6) Save changes and restart 7) Insert USB with bootable ISO 8) Restart, 9) hit F12 right after first splash screen, and you will have an option to select your USB to boot from. 10) Enjoy Linux. You can install, partition, or do whatever. I got Solus Linux running on it. Had some problems getting the latest Manjaro ISOs to fully boot. What you do from there is all up to you. I completely wiped Windows without ever booting into it once. If you are writing a review and you tried Linux, please put something about which Distro and steps you took and any problems you encountered, this helps all folks who want a better OS. Edit: I used the latest Budgie ISO of Solus, and my BIOS is V1.02 as of writing this, but it looks like a BIOS update might be available from Acer's site.","hey there - i got this on prime day for 270 dollars to use as a music streamer - i have 27941 songs that are in digital format using wifi to network it through my relatively new Yamaha R-N803 receiver.  Also i have hooked this up to my Sony TV set for netflix and youtube via HDMI cable.  i had experienced sound dropping from the TV - that is i can see the video but no sound was coming out from my TV set.  I pulled the HDMI and rebooted and it seemed to do the trick. Sometimes there's appears to be a lag or it stutters watching netflix and sometimes there is none.. i think that is because the cable company is prob throttling the download\/upload speeds. they tell you a big number on the speed but they don't guarantee that speed 24\/7. I'm usually not a fan of AMD processors - but it's pretty good but i'm not gaming or doing any heavy processing at all. The screen is not touch screen but not a big deal - the screen's colors look great.  The battery i think i got about 6 hours on a full charge. This computer comes with an empty hard drive bay and there's another expansion slot for RAM.  In the near future i will put in a either a 1TB or 2TB SSD harddrive and prob upgrade the RAM on this thing. I have had this laptop for a week so far no real cons to it. I just wanted to add that this is my 3rd Acer and I don\u2019t have any complaints about any of it. 9\/9\/19 edit - for whatever reason this laptop drops it's connection to the wifi - not sure why - all my other laptops stay connected. 10\/23\/19 - i put JRiver Media Center on this instead using the glitchy Windows Media Player that seemed to turn my music network off whenever it suit it- fidgety and tempermental - not the fault of the hardware.  Also i am not able to access music files from another PC through WMP due to its unstable connection.  JRiver works well - was able to access this dedicated laptop as audio source wirelessly","Got this for under $200 (a steal). I already had a 500GB SSD laying around and added it in. Bought a 16 GB Ram chip and put it in. It can take up to 32 GB (2) 16 GB chips. Now I have a very capable laptop that is much lighter than my old HP Elite Book and at a very reasonable price. I rarely use an optical drive, so the lack of one was no issue for me. I have a portable external that i bought a few years back for under $20 that works just fine. The display is awesome. I have a touch screen laptop for work an I think in two years I  touched the screen less than ten times. So this not having a touch screen was no big deal. the laptop boots fast thanks to the on-board 128 GB SSD where the only thing I have installed there is the OS. Everything else goes to the SD I added.  I am comparing this to a HP elite book from about 5 years ago with that had 500 GB SSD, Intel i5 processor and 16 GB RAM. This Laptop is much snappier that that elite book and about a ton lighter. Plus I no longer need to deal with the issue of carrying a display port to HDMI adapter around. A few things to remember... take it out of Windows S mode if you want to do anything more than simple tasks using Windows Store Apps and be sure to provision the second hard drive if you put it in. It is not automatically identified. Need to go into computer management to mount and format it.","Well, I\u2019m a college student. I ordered this right before class. It worked pretty well. The screen would often stall while browsing Imgur, and I\u2019d have to refresh it so it would respond, but hey, it handled my school stuff pretty well. Also... you\u2019re going to want a speaker. The volume is barely a whisper. Well, during one of it\u2019s freezing episodes, the touchpad stopped working. Talked to Acer support, and we couldn\u2019t get the problem solved. This was 10 days after purchase. I sent it back through amazon for a new version of the same device. I would have went through acer, but I don\u2019t trust them as much as I trust Amazon, and amazon was able to get a new one out to me ASAP\u2014which was a lifesaver because I have a big project coming up.","Got this deal of the day for my son as he goes away to college in the Fall. It has a good display and backlit keyboard but memory resources are lacking which would be expected at this price point. It also comes with Windows 10 S mode so I quickly uninstalled S mode after doing all necessary Windows updates. As it only comes with 4GB of RAM I bought a stick of Crucial 8GB RAM to replace the 4GB stick with. Unfortunately access to the RAM requires removing the back of the laptop. There is no other access panel to do this. While I had the back of the laptop off I also expanded the hard disk space with a Kingston 240 GB HDD since after Windows 10 updates there was only about 95GB of hard drive space left on the 128GB SSD. This laptop comes with 4 screws to attach the HDD to the bracket included on the motherboard. It also has the cable taped to the bottom of the back panel. So for about $60 more I added 8GB of RAM and 240GB more of hard disk space. It does have some bloat ware which I would recommend removing especially if you don't add a HDD. I would recommend this laptop for students or anybody that just wants a solid entry level computer that is expandable.","I bought this for my wife who doesn't have particularly demanding uses for it. Mostly Facebook and email. I immediately upgraded the RAM from 4GB to 16GB with memory I had on-hand, so my review is based on this initial upgrade. We've owned it for about 2 months now. Lets start off with what I like about this laptop. Keep in mind this is weighted by the low price point: - The display is solid, especially at this price point. Every other laptop in this range has a crappy old TN display. This is the real party piece of this laptop. - The aluminum top shell looks nice. - Processor seems adequate, or dare I say it, almost speedy - The SSD also performs well, even if it is on the small side. My wife doesn't store much on her laptop, so this is a non-issue for me. - Battery life is solid. 4 hours of continuous, medium duty use with no issues and 6-8 hours with lighter workloads. - Easy to upgrade. The RAM upgrade was a breeze, and there's even space inside for a 2.5\" SATA drive should you want to go that route instead of NVMe to upgrade storage. If you own an #1 Philips screwdriver and can remember righty-tighty lefty-loosey you should be good to go. This laptop isn't perfect (non of them are), so here's what I'm not crazy about: - The main body of the laptop isn't aluminum, it's plastic. This wouldn't be a big deal except for the fact that the plastic feels cheap. Really cheap. I'd go so far as to say flimsy. This doesn't inspire confidence that it will hold up for the long run, but so far so good. - Ditto on the track pad. It's worse than the track pad from the Chromebook this laptop replaced. - It's very hard to get the connector from the power adapter seated into the charging port. It almost feels like you are going to break something. It's gotten a little better with time though. Well, there it is. A decent performing laptop with questionable build quality. At this price point, that's kind of what I expected. Time will tell how it holds up, but so far, so good. If you have any illusions that this is going to be a budget gaming laptop, let me stop you right there. The processor and on-board video card are fine for normal, day to day tasks, but don't have any illusions about playing the latest video games at acceptable frame rates. Even Minecraft would be a stretch unless you upgrade the RAM like I did.","If you're a student, this is the laptop for you. If you're a bored housewife that needs something basic to surf the web and watch videos, this laptop is for you. If you're a gamer or someone that intends to do some work on this laptop that demands serious CPU or GPU power then you better look elsewhere. For what it is, it works really well. The screen is fairly bright and the colors are vivid. The black is actually black on this screen which is not something you find often with a budget laptop and especially at this price point. The keyboard doesnt bend and the key presses feel pleasantly firm and are a pleasure to type with. The CPU and the integrated GPU are fairly basic but should be more than enough to surf the web, watch videos or play Farmville on Facebook. It won't allow you to do much more, but again it's not supposed to. The speakers are basic and not overly loud but the sound doesn't come off distorted even when it's on maximum volume. Build quality is excellent.","I literally was able to set the computer up, use it a total of three times and now it won't work. I turn it on but the screen is completely black. I have tried all of the different suggestions but nothing has helped. I've chatted with Acer twice and am having to send it back for repairs. I will have to pay for the shipping, go through all the hassle and have no idea when I will receive it back. This has been a complete waste of money and a pain.","I see most people buying Ryzen version. However, unless you have bought Ryzen version at discount during the prime day i3 version cost extra $40 (13%) but offers much better value: 1. If you ever upgrade RAM to 8 GB, the graphics will lock out dedicated 2 GB and you will have 6 GB system, not adjustable. Not the case with i3 which only grabs whats needed (under half gig most of the time) 2. Battery lasts shorter with bigger capacity supplied. Ryzen has longer battery -7h, and i3 - 11h. 3. i3 is faster in benchmarks. 4. Extra ports. Please note laptopd does not take standard m.2 SATA or MNVE drives. It does support HW encryption on the 2.5\" SATA but due to the bug in Bios you cant set au the password (use hdparm on Linux and set both, user and admin passwords) Overall laptop is a good value. Vibrant matte screen, LG panel. Nice keyboard. Perfect for a student, day to day tasks, can have extra drive installed, up to 32 GB RAM for Ryzen (20 GB for i3). Loved the fact sata cable and screws were included. Should last through college.","This laptop, once unlocked out of S mode, is fantastic for the price. It doesn't feel slow, it feels high quality: it is one of the best laptops I've ever owned. The screen quality is fantastic. Love the way the keyboard feels. The aluminum cover on it makes it feel like a high end laptop. The touchpad isn't the best- I hate the 1 button touchpad. I also don't like that the wifi disconnects all the time. Still, for the price, this laptop deserves 5 stars in my opinion because I was expecting way less. If you're getting this, I would suggest you add an SSD drive for greater storage, and upgrade the ram for better performance while using hungry applications.","It is a pretty good computer even though storage is low.but for 350 you can't expect everything. It runs good with very little hiccups. A good basic computer but better than most in this price range. Not disappointed.","Ad stated that I would receive 1 year free subscription to Microsoft Office.  When delivered, it changed to 1 month. Now, when I view my order the ad doesn't say anything about Microsoft Office being included. This was the main reason I purchased this lap top.","So I just grabbed this lap top on an prime day special. I feel I got a great deal. It was very easy to set up and looks very snazzy. I am not sure how great the battery life is yet as this is my first day with it. I did however deduct 1 star for the sound quality. I have a white full HD Acer chromebook I got last year on Amazon that has outstanding sound. This has a backlit keyboard which my chromebook does not. I consider that a plus for sure. I have 4 kids that are all enrolled in virtual schooling so having laptops\/chromebooks for everyone is a definite must for us. I will update once they are back in school and start to really use this laptop. Thus far I am pleased. There has been no lag or glitches yet. I am far from and expert but for basic computer needs I think this fits the bill nicely! OOooh I am greatly disappointed that there is not a hard shell case available for this model! Those cases are life savers so pleaseeeeee somebody make one!","I'm sorry, I'm going to have to demerit the ratings a bit.  I purchased three of these PC Laptops for my clinic (external use; not for patient data).  It took me TWO HOURS to set them up.  I put all three on the countertop and just went from one to the other. This is what I always do.  There's always irritation to work around with setting up computers but these were the worst ones yet.  You have to ensure you don't connect them to the internet during setup because if you do ... YOU MUST ABSOLUTELY sign in with your Microsoft account (or create another one).  They have completely removed the \"create local account\" (the traditional way to log in).  If you entered your wireless network info, you have to (a) unplug your modem and (b) restart the computer and start the set-up all over again because there is no way to \"back up\" to the network entry section.  So terrible.  Because they removed the option to choose a local account, their reasoning for this is simply to control you and your computing experience.  For personal use, this may be okay.  For corporate use, not a chance!  The security problems are incredible with this setup.  You're going to get sued!  So -- after this ordeal, windows is set up.  First thing I ALWAYS do is install Google Chrome and then make it default.  Well, MS made that practically impossible too!  There's now a standard \"Windows S Mode Edition.\"  This is purportedly to prevent you from installing unauthorized content to save your computer.  This is nonsense.  It's a way to ensure everyone uses their crappy MS Edge browser.  Their browser always sucked.  Their browser currently sucks.  Their browser will always suck.  That's why people get rid of it.  But they force you to use it.  You have to now download some app that turns MS S Mode off (that MS makes and publishes).  That would be fine, but now Windows uses a digital copy instead of a key and the digital license ... you guessed it ... could not be verified.  Yep, several restarts, updates, and other bologna and finally I was able to install the S Mode bypass so that I could download Chrome.  Then there's the bloatware.  There is so much packaged into windows that bloats it!  I don't want my employees to play any number of games or waste time on unproductive processes. I have yet to really dive in to the computer but superficially, it looks fine.","I normally do not make much of an effort to review a product unless I am either A: Completely unhappy and dissatisfied or B: So satisfied that I feel I've an obligation to write about it. Design: 10\/10 For starters, this is very similar (if not better) to the appearance of a macbook and seems really light and durable. You can easily fit it in your bag and everything about it screams quality despite how low of a price you're paying for this. I can't for the life of me understand why someone would spend an extra 700 dollars for a mac, but that's just me personally. Performance\/Battery life: 10\/10 The specs aren't the best obviously, but it gets the job done and you get more than what you've even envisioned this machine doing. It's lighting fast with little to no problems this far, if you're using it for everyday use such as writing assignments, watching the occasional (frequent) youtube\/netflix videos, you'll be pleasantly surprised at how smoothly it handles these basic tasks. In terms of gaming, I doubt I'm gonna use it for that as i already got a gaming setup. Battery life averages between 5-7 hours depending on how you're utilizing the machine. Audio: 8\/10 It isn't the loudest, the audio is fine but if there is an AC blasting or a fan, you're gonna have a hard time listening to this. It does get the job done however, and using headphones never hurt anyone. Keyboard and lighting and display: 10\/10 The keyboard is very ez on the fingers and the lighting also ez on the eyes. It'll take you mere minutes to adjust to how easy it is to type on this keyboard and it is extremely quiet, unlike some other laptop keyboards. The display here is the true winner, I thought to myself there is absolutely no way you're getting true HD at this price point, man o man am I glad I was wrong. Conclusion: I reiterate what i said in my title, DO NOT BUY A MACBOOK, BUY THIS! Don't be stupid stupid, save yourself the money and buy something nice instead. This gets the job done and more so. You're welcome. I'm trying to think of 1 flaw that will discourage you the potential buyer of this laptop, I really can't think of none. T","I just recently purchased this computer. A couple of issues I have had so far is that it did not come installed with the video drivers and I had to manually install them. In addition, the computer randomly shuts off without warning, This happens on both battery and plugged in. Finally, right next to the ESC key is the sleep button. I have accidentally hit the sleep button several times and it actually shuts down the computer and closes all of the programs. I am not sure if the problems I am having is by design, or if I just got a wonky computer. Edit* After having this for several months I am changing my review from 3 to 1 star. The random shutoff issue continues. Anytime I try any kind of game and maybe open Chrome to go browse websites, the computer will shutoff, once again not shut down, just shutoff. It then closes ALL programs. At this point, I honestly wish I would have bought a different computer.","This has Windows 10-S & I hate it. So I registered this laptop thru MS and then turned off the \"S\" mode feature on this laptop. I prefer Firefox or Chrome for my browsers....not Edge. 15.6\" monitor....good picture quality. Horrible sound quality. NO SD card reader or DVD\/CD burner. I had to buy external units on both for this laptop. Why Acer deleted the DVD\/CD burner unit on this device is beyond me since they are rather thin in nature on laptops anyways. Lit keyboard...stays lit for maybe 15 seconds.....interesting feature and wished it stayed lit all the time. Needs at least 1 more USB 2.0 or 3.0 port. 128gb Solid State HD.....makes it speedy to power up. Only 4 gbs of memory.....which I order 8 gbs more memory for this device. What is most disgusting with this so-called \"new\" laptop from Acer is the 2nd hard drive slot is too small\/too shallow to fit a laptop mechanical or Solid State hard drive in it at all and the contacts from the laptop to the 2nd hard drive do NOT meet up and thus.....you can NOT install the 2nd hard drive in this device. I had to use an external hard drive via one of few USB ports to put my music and some videos on since the built-in hard drive on this thing is 128 gbs. Also, I had to use another USB port for the external digital camera card reader I had to order as well. And of course, I use an external mouse meaning I used the third and final USB port on this laptop. Not sure why Acer, HP and other brands don't add 1 more USB port on lower priced laptops.....should not cost more just to add 1 more USB port....even if it's the slower USB 2.0 port. Lucky I gave this unit a 2 star....nearly gave it a 1 star. It will do okay for a laptop while traveling or for home use....if you don't view photos from any digital camera via the SD card reader...which this laptop does not have or loading software or Microsoft programs like MS Office....which mine came on CD disks and which this laptop lacks....a DVD\/CD burner. I wonder if this was actually a refurbished laptop instead a new laptop.","Got this as a prime day deal at a great price, but it's a nice deal even at the retail price. At minimum the memory should be upgraded to really make this a great machine, the cheapest upgrade is a single 4GB DDR4-2400 memory stick that would double the memory and enable dial channel operation for a nice performance boost. It works great with Linux as long as you stick with the latest kernels, the stock Debian\/buster 4.19 kernel had some issues, but it works perfectly with the 5.2 kernel. Despite being a slim lightweight laptop with a large and bright screen, it is very easy to replace the memory and hard drive, unlike many recent premium laptops that are glued shut with non-removable components. The back cover can be easily removed to gain access to the memory and ssd. It comes with a 128GB NVMe x2 M.2 2280 WD SN520 SSD, that can be replaced with any 2280 NVMe ssd. Be aware though that only 2 PCIe lanes are connected, so any x4 ssd will run in x2 mode, limiting the bandwidth, but it's still much faster than SATA based SSDs. There are 2 DDR4 SODIMM slots, one occupied by the 4GB stick that comes with the machine, but can be removed to install a bigger stick. The processor supports DDR4-2400 speeds. I have installed 2x8GB memory, and based on the measured memory bandwidth I can confirm that it operates in dual-channel mode. The machine also has an empty slot for a 2.5\" drive, which is useful for those that need lots of cheap storage on board, but using that would reduce battery life. The processor is pretty fast, on par with Intel Core i3 netbooks, and the integrated  Radeon graphics easily beats the integrated graphics in Intel chips, especially with the upgraded dual channel memory, but obviously this is not a gaming laptop. Pros: Great price, upgradable memory (32GB should work), upgradable 2280 NVMe SSD, empty 2.5\" HDD slot, beautiful screen, gigabit RJ45 port, lightweight Cons: not so great battery life, no SD card reader, no USB-C port, cheap speakers, air intake at the bottom","I joined the masses and ordered this laptop for it's \"potential\". The detailed reviews about the ease of upgrading the RAM and adding another SSD was the tipping point and proved to be true. I added a second 4gb stick and a 512mb 7mm SSD drive. From start to finish, including updates, was less than 30 minutes.  Super quick boot time <10 sec to log in screen. You will want to update the graphics driver via device manager. The rest of the drivers were up to date. Sound quality was a concern. I went into the Realtek manager and switched from music mode to game mode and it made a big difference in the volume for me. Your mileage may vary. If you prop the front of the laptop up slightly, not covering the speakers, the quality improves also. All in for me, including the RAM and second SSD was under $300 with all discounts. Happy to replace my workhorse, but slowly dying HP I have had for 8 years. Hoping this ACER will fill it's shoes.","I initially loved this laptop and would give it a 4 star, maybe 5 at this price. It starts up immediately with no wait time. Super fast response and web browsing. My ONLY gripe is the sound is AWFUL. I mean so bad you can barely hear anything at times. What's worse is that after searching myself for enhancement or equalization controls and finding none, I wasted 45 minutes waiting for Acer tech support to find out this updated version of Windows 10 no longer offers the enhancement or equalization feature! And the techie tells me at first my speakers are only 3 watts... then he corrected himself and said THESE speakers are only TWO watts! So, if you want to purchase external speakers, keep it hooked up to your tv, or use ear plugs all the time, maybe this computer is for you. Otherwise, this computer is only good for the totally deaf! My cheap phone has better speakers than this thing. I'm not even talking sound QUALITY, I mean just hearing in general! Come on, ACER, why did you totally blow it on speakers that barely speak!","So I bought this laptop on prime-day for school and so far it has been good. I upgraded the ram from 4 GB to 16 GB but only 13.9 GB was usable (weird). I have not played any games on it. The laptop turns on fast and the overall speed is good. The picture quality is very excellent. Now the keyboard was a little turn off. The keys feel like they will brake and they are small. Most of the time the laptop fans are fine and quite. But once in a while it starts working hard and it gets loud. The USB slots are a little tight. It doesn't go in smoothly and go out smoothly. I wouldn't recommend putting the computer on a blanked or something of sort. Only on something hard. Otherwise for my intended purpose it was worth the price. As for the Windows S mode if you go into the windows store there is a free app that let's you switch out of it. You need a windows account to download and install it. Edit: I tried turning off the maximum memory option which limits the memory but it didn't work. I tried putting in only 1 stick of memory in one of the slots and vise versa but it didn't work. So no problem with the memory cards. I guess the problem would be with the laptop itself.","I bought this laptop to use to learn how to code on the go, but the quality of the mouse pad is very, very poor and so I am going to return it. When coding, you frequently have to move the mouse to highlight specific pieces of text to do some sort of edit in your code. Unfortunately, the mousepad on this laptop is not accurate or precise, and when trying to make fine movements with the mousepad, the mouse moves in very, very small skips instead of a smooth, consistent glide. This makes it impossible to move the mouse quickly and precisely, because when trying to execute precise movements, you have to slow down and course correct several times when you get the mouse close to where you want it to go (instead of being able to quickly move the mouse to the precise location you intend). This lack of precision is very frustrating, and makes the user experience so slow that I am going to return it. I purchase laptops for at least 2 years of consistent use, and I just don't want to endure that kind of frustration every single day as I'm trying to give all of my attention towards building a technical skill. For those who appreciate speed and accuracy with the mousepad (just like with a mac laptop if you've ever used one - nothing too crazy, just very smooth and controllable motion that follows your input perfectly), I would advise you not to get this laptop, because I think you could be very frustrated with the user experience. As a final note, this laptop also had issues running Ubuntu 18.04 - whenever I closed the lid, the laptop would suspend (this is totally expected; \"suspend\" is just means \"sleep\" for linux), but whenever I reopened the lid, the laptop would not resume (turn back on) and I would have to force shut down and restart it (every single time). I could not find a solution to this issue after scouring the internet and trying a bunch of different fixes for about 4 or 5 hours. Some linux distributions have small issues with certain laptops, so for whatever reason Ubuntu 18.04 and this laptop just did not work well together. This issue was also frustrating and made for a very diminished user experience, although I may have been able to find another distribution that would have worked with this laptop. But for both of these reasons (very much mainly the first reason, the mousepad), I am returning this laptop. Don't want to deal with an issue like that for 2 years, rather just spend a little more money. Hope this is helpful.","Great laptop for the price.  Add 4-8GB more of RAM and a 1TB hard drive (easy enough to do) and this laptop will give you just about all you need short of medium-hard gaming.  The keyboard is nice, screen is great, mouse pad OK, decent battery life, and it has most inputs\/outputs you might need.  If you are looking to save some sheckles, this is the laptop for you. If you are undecided between the i3 or Ryzen chip, the extra $40ish dollars would be better spent on RAM or an internal hard drive.  The i3 might be a little better, but it won't be noticable.  The Ryzen with extra RAM will probably perform better than the i3 anyway. As far as Win 10 in S mode, I am happy that it is set up this way.  There was little to no bloatware on the laptop, and the apps you do not want\/need are much easier to delete than removing programs.  Switching to normal Win 10 was simple, and I have about 95GB left on the M.2 NVME drive.  For those having problems switching out of S mode, the most common mistake is not validating your version of Win 10.  Validate first while in S mode, then switch out (most how-to websites are showing you how to switch out after Win 10 has been validated).","When I got this laptop, the F keys were automatically preset to their functions instead of simply being F keys. Normally, you have to hold \"Fn\" and hit an F key to use the function, but it was reversed on this machine. Also, the keyboard backlight turned itself off after 20 seconds of inactivity whether or not it was plugged in. It kind of defeats the purpose of a backlit keyboard, in my opinion, when you can't see the keys before you start typing. At any rate, both the F key and backlight issues were mostly fixed when I updated the BIOS directly from the Acer support site. I was then able to find settings for both in BIOS and disable automatic function key and backlight timeout. My only gripe is that there doesn't seem to be any way to keep the backlight on for more than 20 seconds when unplugged, no matter the power settings or BIOS configuration. Lots of Googling and worthless Acer chat support sessions later, I'm convinced there's no workaround. That issue aside, I can't really say anything else negative about this machine. At this price point, this is about as good as it gets. If you plan on doing anything other than browsing the internet and using Office, I do recommend purchasing an additional 4GB RAM stick and installing it yourself. It took me maybe 5 minutes with a YouTube tutorial video. Between that extra RAM and the stock SSD, I can run low-end games with Chrome and Skype running in the background all at once with no slowdown whatsoever. It's lightweight, the screen is decently bright, and it'll go for hours without needing a charge. If you're in the market for a light-to-medium spec laptop for everyday use, this should be your go-to.","After spending some time looking for the perfect budget laptop, I saw the specs listed and was very interested. 128gb ssd, amd ryzen 3200u, decent graphics card, backlit keyboard. Great value for money. If you're willing to deal with regular problems and that cheap pricepoint is all you're looking for, this is a good option. Pros: Backlit keys regularly turn off to save battery. Haven't found a setting to adjust this, but there's that. All keys have good travel, with a quiet clickiness. Quick activation, but they're thin enough that you won't notice it. Numpad is kinda small but it's also backlit and the layout isn't bad. Dysfunctional touchapad is big. 1080p. It's cheap, got this for $320. Cons: I'll list the cons from design flaws to potential model defects. First and most noticable is the misaligned trackpad, with it starting at the middle of the left alt key and ending at the spacebar. Not a major problem but it's left me often checking my thumbs. Right alt key is much smaller than the left. Webcam is pretty bad, so if you want to use it, you would be better off facetime or google hangouts. ok here's the glitches I've noticed as of opening up the laptop less than 6 hours ago. All keys are sticky and don't always activate. G and B have given me the most problems. I have to press hard to make them activate. The trackpad only works on the right side of the trackpad. There is no left clicking. Chrome is slow and glitchy, reminding me of pixel slate, not crashing but taking several seconds to scroll down or anything basic. The \"brightness down\" and \"brightness up\" buttons are reversed. Volume isn't though. Back to the touchpad because it's causing more problems! It will randomly activate a double tap, causing entire sections of text to be selected. This money you'll save by buying this device is not worth the anger from repeately hitting the G key to et it to activate.","Ac\u00e1 en Argentina por este valor es imposible conseguir algo similar, por este valor se consiguen notebooks de hace a\u00f1os con procesador atom y disco mecanico. Sobresale la calidad de su pantalla FULL HD IPS. El teclado retroiluminado es muy prolijo y delicado el cual es de gran utilidad de noche o con poca luz. Su cuerpo de aluminio es elegante y liviano. Un punto medio flojo es el pad, es bastante ruidoso al ser pl\u00e1stico. La bateria aun no la prob\u00e9 tanto como para poder opinar.

A futuro le instalar\u00e9 un disco para datos sata y 4gb m\u00e1s de memoria ram m\u00ednimo pero por el momento muy contento con la compra","As a non gamer, the Acer A515-43 is a great all around value.  The top is made of brushed aluminum and looks and feels great.  The weight is more than I care for but as a home\/family computer, it serves us well.  The unit only has 4GB of ram, but for the average user it works great.  It is glitch free and the processor is  beast.  Even though streaming Prime, Netflix Hulu plus others is not an issue, I am upgrading to 16GB of RAM to improve speed on some applications.  The keyboard is very quiet with a high end look and feel.  The touchpad is nice and quite and works flawlessly.  On a full charge, I can get just about 7 hours before warning to plug in notification kicks in.  For the price, I am very pleased with this purchase and recommend it to those in the market for a quality notebook with great value.","The laptop is running great and I think it is an exceptional value. This may not be a powerhouse but if you want it for light gaming or Internet surfing then you can't go wrong with this one. All in all this is a great Laptop and I could not be happier with my purchase.If you want a budget laptop you won't go wrong with this one. I recieved the laptop yesterday and got busy setting it up this morning. First thing I let windows update run. I then went through settings and turned off and uninstalled all of the stuff I did not want. I then turned off S mode.I was not offered 1903 until I went to Acer and updated the BIOS. Installing 1903 went without a hitch..I have also ordered extra ram for it to bring it up to 16 GB dual channel. I have a additionl ssd I will be adding to it","Received this on November 20, 2019 to gift to my daughter for Christmas.  I ended up finding a gaming laptop for a decent price through Black Friday and decided to keep this for myself.  Unboxed and booted up and as soon as the blue screen turned on, I noticed a few small white vertical lines (dead pixels?)n the left side of screen.  Now I know from the moment it was in my possession it was safely cared for hidden in a closet.  Immediately contacted Amazon and set up a refund and shipping label for me to send back.  The box it arrived in wasn't damaged in any way so it has to be hardware related.  I even went into BIOS and the lines still appeared.  Higher standards should be set on these laptops.  Hopefully my new one doesn't have the same issue.  Get a protection plan!!!","Had great success with Acer in the past. This was my first subpar experience. Laptop screen had shortage out of the box. This should justify a new replacement but they made me send it back for repair. Haven\u2019t received it back yet so the jury is out.","This laptop has al you need. SSD - fast boot times. Able to increase RAM? Yes. I added another 8gb ddr4 ram to make it 12gb. Installation done easily from youtube for someone who never opened a laptop before in my life. Able to add more HDD\/SSD? Yes. Added another SSD on the SATA\/HDD slot. Now my laptop has more RAM and disk space. It was already fast from the start but adding more disk space is necessary i feel, 128gb just doesnt cut it. SLEEK design, 15.6\u201d screen but able to fit into 14\u201d laptop case. Small power brick. Backlight keyboard. Long battery life (in-built).Has all you need. For gaming, the graphics card is not the best so i dont recommend it for serious gaming but for normal gaming with lesser loads it works like a charm. Great value laptop for the price, still cant believe the price!","For the price point, this is a basic laptop that is NOT touch screen. I'm not sure why this laptop appears as part of a search for touch screen, and why it's listed as an option to be rated. Things I like: - Start up is fast. Turns on and off with ease. Cheap. - Fairly light, big screen. Keyboard is great. Backlit keyboard. - Battery life seems ok. About 3-4 hours so far without needing to charge. Things I don't like: - The volume is horrendous. My phone plays music and shows louder than this computer. Use headphones\/earphones or plug-in speakers. Has a bit of a muffled quality with the speakers being on the bottom of the laptop (at the two corners of the laptop). - Backlit keyboard doesn't stay on likely to save energy, but I prefer the keyboard to stay on. I haven't been able to find an option to change this setting. - Camera quality is terrible. It's so pixelized it reminds me of a computer I had in the early 2000's. Don't get this laptop if you plan on having video calls or anything to do with video. - The touchpad is doing something odd where it'll minimize my browser and I'll have to re-open the browser when I'm scrolling or using the touchpad. I've looked at every possible setting. - Tried to edit some docs and it started highlighting things on its own. - Hinged laptop: Every computer I've had in the past where the screen is hinged has over time broken off, became loose, or doesn't work properly. There is no fingerprint reader. There was a review that mentioned this, but I don't have this option. This computer is touted as lightning fast, but it lags if I have more than 2 tabs open. The microphone occasionally fails, oddly where if you test the microphone it works, but if you use anything requiring the microphone you get an error message. I've had to reboot this thing twice now. I needed a computer in a pinch for general browsing, but I would honestly pay a bit more for better quality. I bought this for the screen size so I can watch shows while traveling, but defeats the purpose if the sound is muffled.","I got this laptop on prime day for roughly 250ish after using rewards points and deal of the day. i put a second ssd into i had lying around and a second stick of ram for a total of 8 gigs this display is easily the best part of this machine. i put world of warcraft on it and with every thing turned down pretty low it runs at an average of 40 fps at 1080p in lfr raid situation. for this price you cannot come close to something like this anywhere else it's simply beautiful.","Bought this to run some radio receiver programs. In truth this laptop is less than half the price of my main laptop that I purchased about three years ago and which I thought at the time was great value for money. The screen on this laptop is stunning for this price point, bright, with great contrast, a real eyepopper and the laptop itself is smaller and significantly lighter than my main laptop of identical size screen size. Basically the screen fills the upper part with almost no margins, it's just all screen.  I've been using it as my main lap top the past couple days to surf the net and run some programs and it's fast and responsive so I don't think I'll need to purchase any additional memory.  Forgot to mention the keyboard, it's illuminated which is really great and something my \"twice as expensive laptop from three years back doesn't even have\". In summary, this laptop is incredible value for money and really stands out from the competition as a bargain.","Absolutely love this laptop so far. It starts up super quick, probably 5 or 10 seconds from when you push the power key. The screen has good graphics. I\u2019m not a gamer but i am a photographer and graphic designer, so the graphics are very important. The setup was very easy. It was no problem at all to switch from S mode to regular Windows 10. The screen is nice and large. And I love the number pad at the right. Most laptops don\u2019t have that. The keyboard only lights up for a little bit unless you are actively typing. I know it bothers some but i understand the point of it, if you are watching a movie it\u2019s nice to not have anything else lit up. If you want it to light up again, just hit any key. We got this on Prime Day so it was an even better price than it\u2019s normal price, but even the normal price is great for this computers features. It comes with Cortana which helps you set it up, but you can always turn her off.","This laptop is light and sleek with an elegant, appealing design. I find its performance impressive because of the speed with which it accesses information on the web, email, and documents. For a device with specifications that seem basic, it does a superb job. Pictures and videos are full and rich and do justice to its advertised \u201cFull HD (1920 x 1080) Widescreen LED-backlit IPS Display\u201d The computer does not have a touchscreen and that works perfectly for me.  I found that its battery runs for nearly ten hours on full charge during routine use. Of course, intense applications can decrease this. It runs quietly and its keyboard is silent, no matter the typing speed. Keys light up on its backlit keyboard as soon as typing begins. This factor can influence a buying decision for those looking for similar items. The description is accurate for this laptop, and I mention this because it is such a hassle to have to repack and ship off an item because of inaccurate description. Overall, this computer is an excellent buy when compared to its more expensive competitors.","After a few days of use that message was all that appeared on the screen after the Acer logo. Sent back to Amazon; they've had it back since the 25th. So Far NO refund. No comment as to whether they had removed ALL the personal data including BOTH our banking and order placing links of both my wife and myself.","I just wanted a basic, inexpensive laptop for going back to school part-time. I just really need something that I can use to write papers, use Microsoft Office on, and take notes. I definitely use it also for YouTube streaming and some internet stuff. It's really good! I switched to Windows 10 Home edition immediately.  The laptop is really light for being 15\" honestly, I can carry it around in my backpack and can't tell the difference if I don't have it in my bag.  Really like the backlit keyboard as well. The system is fast enough, and can handle a few tasks at once without slowing down, and that's really all I need! I am keeping in mind that I can upgrade my hard drive and RAM someday when things start to slow down, and if I start to require heavier usage out of this laptop. But, I'm very happy with the price point and quality, and glad I have the choice to upgrade features in the future.","I'll make this review quick I bought this laptop for my 78 year old father who is an avid computer user. My Dad loves the laptop, its extremely stylish and light. I can lift the laptop with just my fingers. The battery life is excellent. My father uses the laptop for Email, Browsing, YouTube and those applications load instantly. The screen is bright and high quality compared to other laptops in this same price range. This laptop has a full HD IPS display which you won't find on most other laptops under $400. My Dad also finds the text clear and easy to read. I did buy an extra 8GB of ram but I didn't install it! I've had the laptop around 6 months with zero problems. The only issue with the laptop and with every laptop I've ever used is the mouse pad is not great! I had already planned for this and ordered a wireless USB mouse. On that note even on my expensive Alienware laptop my mouse pad is difficult to use and not used! I strongly suggest ordering a mouse with this laptop and on Amazon you'll find inexpensive mouses designed for laptops made on the smaller side making them easier for travel. Thumbs Up - 5 Star product","I bought this laptop as a replacement for my old Toshiba laptop from 2012. The Toshiba one was starting to show its age by failing to pass POST and thus failing to boot. I had used it almost every single day since 2012 after all, as it was my college laptop and even helped me launch my career as an engineer, so it has served me well. But the OS failures were getting troublesome. They were happening increasingly often, so I decided before all my data was lost (which wasn't really that much, since I keep all my actually important data on a home file server), I decided to shop around for a nice, reliable, not-too-cheap laptop I could use to replace it, and this is the one I chose to buy. For the non-Linux enthusiasts, feel free to skip this paragraph, but a kernel panic is basically the Windows blue screen of death equivalent on Linux. My old Toshiba was having kernel panics all the time starting with Kernel 5, so I thought maybe it was my old hardware which has having trouble with the brand new kernel. I tried an LTS version of Kernel 4.19, thinking it was going to solve my kernel panic issue, but nope. I still had kernel panics all the time, and it was starting to get worrying how often it was happening (multiple times a day near the time I got this new Acer laptop). So I feel like I got the new Acer laptop just in time before the Toshiba hardware became unbootable. Now, I'm an electrical engineer, but I'm a lazy engineer. I didn't feel like dissecting the Toshiba to try and pinpoint what the problem might have been. I use Arch btw (best meme 2k19) So back to regular English. I'm thoroughly impressed with the hardware that AMD has developed with their Ryzen lineup and their Vega graphics. Sadly, with all the cryptocurrency mining happening nowadays, it's actually hard to find any AMD graphics card for use with actual graphics workloads like gaming. But that's beside the point. This Acer laptop, with its Ryzen 3 processor and built-in Vega Picasso graphics is almost overkill for what I use it for. I haven't tested any games on it, but I imagine it would run Minecraft well enough. Maybe not 60fps, but still enough to play. I use this laptop mainly for just web browsing, and occasional coding when I'm feeling ambitious with some sort of personal software project I want to work on. In the time that I used Windows 10 S Mode... it was just plain dumb. Not being able to install software from non-Microsoft sources? Really, Microsoft? What are you doing? You can easily opt out of the S Mode crap, but it warns you that you'll never be able to go back to S Mode in the future if you ever change your mind. Like that'll scare me into keeping S Mode! I'll show you how much I care about S Mode. I only spent about a half hour tinkering with it before I just blasted the whole NVMe M.2 drive clean and installed good old Arch Linux on it with a fully encrypted filesystem, so ain't nobody getting into my data. And I can say, this NVMe M.2 drive is freaking lightning quick. Compared to the old HDD on my Toshiba, this new laptop boots in like 15 seconds, if even that. My main PC with Godly specs (Intel i9-9900K + RTX2080Super + 1TB Samsung NVMe M.2) boots in around 10 seconds, so this little laptop is definitely keeping up with the speed. Overall, this Acer laptop is a fantastic computer; probably the best laptop I've ever owned at this price point. It's perfect for basic usage, and I recommend it to be used for light workloads like checking email, browsing social media, editing office documents, coding, and other basic tasks of the sort. The Ryzen + Vega chip will definitely last several years, and I'm happy to finally support a quality AMD product. Ultimately, it's up to you as the customer to decide if this is the right computer for your needs. Evaluate why you need this computer and determine whether or not the price of this laptop would best suit your needs. I needed something I could rely on with streaming, decoding, and rendering video data from YouTube, Twitch, and\/or Netflix which is actually a bigger task than people give it credit for. If you don't intend to watch many videos or do anything more resource-intensive than that, then this laptop might be a touch too powerful for your needs. With all that in mind, it's safe for me to say that this Acer laptop is perfect for the moderately light workloads I intend to use it for.","I love the screen on this laptop. Everything looks very sharp and has good colors. The keyboard feels great, and the laptop is very light weight. I have been getting about 6 hours from each charge of the battery. I added an extra 4GB of RAM the same day that I received the laptop, and this was very simple. There are plenty of how to videos on YouTube. Regarding the Windows 10S version, as indicated in other reviews this is easy to remove. Don't let the one-star reviews for Windows 10S sway your decision. The computer comes with a trial version of MS Office. I use Office almost exclusively at work, but I am trying something different with this laptop so I will be using LibreOffice. I can't say anything that the hundreds of other 5 star reviews haven't already said. Personally, I would buy this same laptop again (with the 4GB of extra RAM), and I would recommended it to a friend or a family member. I found one interesting change in the CMOS setup. I reversed the functionality of the Function\/Media keys. By default pressing the Fn keys performs the alternate task, e.g. brightness, volume, disabling touchpad, wi-fi off, etc.","Why Acer install this version of Windows 10 with forced S-mode??  Shame on you Microsoft & Acer!  Forcing people to sign-up with an email or phone number to even log into this laptop....  Then you cannot install any apps that are not in Microsoft store, and you have to use Edge that uses Bing only.  You can turn this off, but only after you have provided your person information.  No command prompt either while in S mode.  Wow just wow.","I am a student...I write papers, watch movies, check email, play a random game or two. This computer meets or exceeds all of my needs. I love the way the keyboard feels and having the number pad is a plus. If you are prone to getting frustrated easily, are computer illiterate, and feel you can't pick up very basic computer tasks with the help of youtube and other tutorials then this might not be the lap top for you. I just got hacked on my previous computer, and so I'm actually appreciating the S mode for a few months, but I can tell it's very easy to remove - again, if you're willing to take five minutes to figure it out. Supposedly memory can be added easily - using YouTube university and a screwdriver. I find it very fast, the screen is crystal clear, and it has so far been able to handle any task I've thrown at it. I do not consider myself very computer literate, so another plus to this machine is that it's helped to push me out of my comfort zone and into understanding laptops better while I streamline startup and other functions, and understand workings through the limitations of the 'S' setup. Sleek, sturdy, straightforward...feels like I should have paid a lot more. Only reason I can't give it five start is because I'm still getting used to the mouse pad placement and I can't help but compare it to higher end, much more expensive machines.","I will use it for travel and in the kitchen and as I am a photographer the display is good enough to process images on.  I did not upgrade the drive since I use them as temp storage only but took it off the stupid windows S mode and loaded the open office software, photo software and chrome and hooked it up to a spare 500 gb external hard drive and logged on and went to work.  I turned the touchpad off as it just makes me touch it inadverntently as I use a wireless mouse.  Excellent value and is quite fast with the $24 extra 4 gb of ram I added to it as well.  Installed myself.  Way better than dell machines and HP I have had before and especially for the price.  nice and slim.","As I write this I am on the phone with Microsoft attempting to get multiple issues resolved.  I have now spent mores than 6  SIX hours in 5 different times.  First they tool it out of the S mode but issues still hang on like having to sign into EVERYTHING MULTIPLE TIMES, over and over and over again.  It is enough that you want to  throw something.  I am about to hang up now because I have been on hold for 9 minutes THIS  time.","This Acer Aspire S laptop is a mixed bag, but useful and priced right for the right user. The pros are the Microsoft 10 S, the safe operating mode used in schools. It restricts your flexibility and internet use, which is a good thing for those with limited understanding of the dangers of the internet. Not having to worry as much as malware or viruses is a good thing. More on this below. The 4 GB of memory is low, but again - the price. Speaking of - the price, currently in the mid 300s, is fair for a laptop. The set-up is easy with the assistance of the onboard Cortana helper. Backlit keyboard is nice, too, although more about that, too. The sound is fair, the monitor is good, and the size, weight, and portability are solid. The cons are the memory, the restrictions inherent in S mode (which you can take off, but once gone, it's gone, which seems odd to me), the backlit keyboard which goes off after a few seconds...why?), the six hour battery, and the sound which is rarely good on a laptop no matter the price. On the whole, for the right user, this is an ideal laptop with a solid price. For simple computer basics (e-mail, basic internet searching), it will work well enough. How long it lasts and slows down over time remain to be seen, but so far, so good.","Installed with S-Mode.  You can apparently switch out of it (that's yet to be determined) but don't hit the wrong link!  Then it will mess it all up.  Oops!  I'm so beyond frustrated with this computer that I'm ready to throw it out the window.  I'm resetting the computer.  It better not be all messed up and I better be able to return this thing if I can't get it fixed. I got this PC because I had to run some windows only external apps.  This is why I hate Windows.  Stupid games. I've never experienced games like this with a MAC.  If I could give zero stars I would. Now i have to (hopefully) go through the whole setup process again.  FURIOUS.","I got it on sale on Prime Day, so to go with it I bought a 16GB ram kit and a 240GB SSD hard drive.  Without those upgrades it would probably be ok for office tasks and minimal web browsing.  For the price and even after upgrading the ram and hard drive I think it's well worth it for the money.  You can step up in price for the laptop but will not have that much ram.  The NVMe drive seems quick and now that I have the additional hard drive I don't have to worry about space.  The install of parts wasn't to bad.  Take out all the screws on the bottom, peal apart and install parts.  Separating the bottom was a little difficult, very well fit, so if you're hesitant in computer work, ask for help.  It took some finesse.  It almost feels like you'll break something so just go slow.  Back to the laptop. The screen is very good.  No problems with brightness and angles.  The speakers are ok, but then again this is a cheap laptop.  They're definitely better than some others I had but just keep a set of earbuds with it and you'll be fine.  Plus no one wants to listen to what you want, so just plug in for everyone's sake.  The battery life is ok.  I might be able to get about 6 hours out of it.  Haven't done a full test yet, only have used it for about 2 hours at a time.  Just over 2 hours of online use is dropping it to about 60%. The keyboard is pretty good.  Types pretty well.  The numpad is a little small but for the size of the laptop it's to be expected.  I would rather have it than not.  I do like the backlight.  Yes it times out after a couple of seconds.  But it does not turn off while you are using it.  It times out to conserve the battery.  I saw complaints about that but why would you want the backlight to stay on even when you're not tying?  Just doesn't make any sense.  I think it's fine.  Touchpad seems fine, but at this price point I didn't expect greatness.  I usually use a mouse anyway.  All in all I think this is a great deal especially is you upgrade the parts.  Lightweight, looks good, works good, and all my friends ask how it's so good at a good price.","I don't game on my laptop and only need it for writing and general internet use. It's perfect in that capacity. I had another Acer before and the screen quality on this model is a huge improvement. I can't speak to the longevity yet, although this is a concern because my other Acer only lasted a couple years, and I am not particularly hard on my electronics. (I still use the iPod I bought in 2007 and I've never broken a phone.) This model is also much slimmer and lighter, which I love. I wish I had this version before I graduated so I didn't have to lug my other huge one to class--especially once it ended up taped together for an entire semester and the bar exam! I also love the backlit keyboard. I use it a lot at night and it makes that a lot easier. My only two complaints are that the bottom left corner of the mousepad is a bit soft when left clicking on it and I pretty much always have to have the sound at full volume. If anything I'm listening to is quiet, I often struggle to hear it. The quality of sound itself is good, though.","I am so pleased with this laptop. I have an higher end hp touchscreen, but it's slow as molasses. I wanted something faster. This Acer is way faster and has great battery life. I am using the window 10 s version for now because it's supposed to be more secure. The Microsoft store has a large array of apps available. I am a heavy Microsoft office and photoshop user. Currently  I am using a free office alternative. Not as easy to use as Word...yes, I just called Word easy to use! I may need to upgrade to Office. I cannot do without Adobe Photoshop. But I found it in the store for a good discount. I haven't had any difficulty with video streaming, which also use quite a bit. I don't use my laptop for gaming, so I cant speak on its ability.  The Windows 10 S wont let me add Minecraft full PC version for my daughter to use, which is disappointing. I may choose the option to upgrade to Windiws 10 pro at a later date. For now, I haven't hit many obstacles with the S version and I am reassured by its safety. Overall, it seems to be a very solid, speedy laptop for my needs as a teacher.","I was expecting a delay but gladly they made it on time. The product is super smooth and well packed. The specifications of the product has meet my expectation and it was a fantastic brand. I would highly recommend this laptop as it an example of best buy. As far as the functionality is concerned, it has provided a fast and high quality of services and it really fit the budget even if I'm from Philippines but the product really exceeds the price. I can say that when you buy this laptop, you will surely love to buy again of the same kind. Thanks Amazon for my first experience buying in your platform. You've done a great job!","So far so good!  Acer thanks for making the laptop easy to upgrade ram and to add a second SSD. Laptop will be used for my mom's basic computing needs.  I usually build computers but for the price of $310.00 it was hard to pass on this deal.  Added in a stick of Crucial DDR4 8gb, 2666 ram and a 240gb Crucial SSD, total cost $388.00. Windows 10 S was disabled.  At first MS had a server issue but after reading some blogs, it was resolved by doing the windows updates first before disabling Windows 10 S. Since Microsoft is ending it's support for Windows 7 in January 2020 I may just order another one for myself. If you have a computer that's 5 years old or older time to upgrade.  This ACER won't disappoint, it's a great laptop.  Add in another 8 gb of ram & 2nd SSD & you're good to go.  ACER does provide the 4 screws for the 2nd SSD. ***Updated & added review for those of you having issues with disabling Windows 10 S.  After I disabled it I did a factory reset from Acer care.  I was surprised that after the factory reset there was no Windows 10 S.  I had Windows 10 Home.  Hope this tip can help others.","So I got the Acer Aspire because I already had an Acer for 4 years and then it started giving trouble. I saw the reviews for this and decided to get one because it is 1080 HD display. But just WOW. The Design is sleek and the user interface  set up with Cortana was both humorous and intuitive. I don't really write like reviews.... like ever. But I only had the labtop a day now and i'm writing a review. It is so silent . Like reaaaaaaaaaaaaally quiet. You will wonder if it is on, and it doesn't get warm\/hot. The display is the best HD screen I have ever had in a labtop. The colors pop right at you. sharp images that pull you in. NO glare. and no matter what angle you look at it ...it still so good. The sound is amazing. I want to watch videos all the time because of how great the sound is on this labtop. Better quality than I was expecting. Its also lightning fast and has some cool features where you incorporate your phone if you would like. The labtop will be in S- mode, trun it off if you need to (it should give you instructions how, the first time you try to download a third party product) ...once you do there is no going back. The touch pad has a nice tactile feel to it. And is somewhat comforting. Battery power is amaaazing. just like  my old acer labtop I can use it a long time uncharged, and I can even modify the settings to make it last longer too. I could go on and on. I am very please with this labtop. Worth the money. Specs I thinks its 4 GB Ram, and 128 GB hard drive but I don't plan to download much on this labtop. lightweight... and key are lit which mega plus for typing in dark places ok im done you get it","I loved the overall look and response of this laptop.  Then the problems started.  I'd be typing and the screen would go to black.  For  no apparent reason, no picture, no sound, just a black screen.  The first time it happened I didn't quite believe it.  Then it happened a second time.  I believed I'd touched something.  Then it started to happen multiple times during a session.  I'm not a gamer and was taxing any of the design elements.  Still black screen, back on, black screen, repeatedly.  I returned the computer for another brand and model.  We'll have to see how it works out.","my likes....  cheap... decent picture... my unlikes\u2026. only dual core.. only 4 gig of ram..making it pretty slow...\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...this isnt for gaming...\u2026 if u just wanta browsing laptopcheck email you tube this is for u..","If you're studying and need a Windows devices for a Chromebook price I believe there is no competition to this laptop. Pros: 1. Slim and light, 2. Aluminum top cover that makes a premium, elegant look, 3. OMG it's a 1080p 15.6\" screen (not those 1366x768), it gets better. 4. Backlit keyboard... So far it's soundless, exhaust speaking (this one lies in the rear, not on the sides which is great) the power brick is very small and something that I really love is the RYZEN 3 3200u 2.6Ghz base clock with VEGA graphics and 4Gb of ram expandable with an empty internal space for a 2.5\" HDD or SSD CONS: I don't believe are that of a CON but is good for buyers to know. 1. Is not touch screen for those interested in this feature and 2. It comes with WINDOWS IN \"S\" MODE? for who does not know it's basically windows in smartphone mode (meaning ONLY ABLE TO INSTALL APPS FROM THE STORE) Note: to unlock hassle free, just donwload a .EXE then run as administrator accept the emerging window and it will transfer you to the store straight to the SWITCH OUT OF S MODE page and just click the GET button. Besides that I couldn't be happier...","I'm really impressed with this laptop. First off, the build quality is really solid and premium feeling. They keyboard is just right. The backlights are a nice bonus.  I wish the keyboard layout was a bit different with larger arrow keys but that is just a minor thing. The screen is really gorgeous, with large viewing angles and really black blacks. Battery life seems pretty good. One thing that surprised me on this laptop was the graphics. I wasn't expecting much but I installed Counterstrike Source and did a quick test and it gets over 100fps in 1080p. I did not try any new games but just the fact it can play even older 3d games alone is a nice bonus to me. I've ordered the 4gb extra ddr to get a performance boost, that should be the first thing done to this laptop, after turning off windows S mode and uninstalling bloatware.","I ordered two of these and the first one was defective. The second one works properly. I bought this Windows 10 laptop to replace my two Acer Chromebooks (which are think, light, portable, and boot up fast). Overall, this is a steal. Everything runs smooth, and the computer works great for basic tasks like work processing, browsing the web, and watching YouTube videos. The lighted keyboard is awesome, and I love the fact that all the jacks are on the left (there is nothing worse than a bunch of cables running out of the side where you might run an external mouse). The only glitch I've ran into is multitasking. While running Amazon Prime video on an external monitor and then writing this review, I saw the frame-rate of the video drop a little and some minor hiccups. Still, I'm happy with the performance of the laptop. Especially for three Benjamin.","This PC is a great buy. The only upgrade I made was adding 8 GB of memory to bring it up to 12 GB, which is perfect for my needs. I will be using it for the usual document editing, spread sheets, internet browsing, etc. I also opted to download the full version of Windows 10, which is a free conversion. If you just want an inexpensive, light, large-screened, quick, and reliable laptop, buy this one.","I bought this to use as a low power draw desktop replacement, since I already have a 13 inch Dell 2in1 for travel and portability. The Dell is an i3-6100u processor and this ryzen 3 is noticeably faster. Nice screen, pairs with a 27 inch Acer monitor with no hassles whatsoever.  I use a bluetooth speaker, so I'm not too concerned about speaker quality; it's nothing to brag about on this laptop.  i wouldn't mind 5gHz wireless, but this will be hardwired into a gigabit router most of the time anyway. It's a budget machine, after all. I upgraded to 8gb Ram and don't plan to add another SSD. I'm using a compact USB flash drive for expansion, as that allows me to easily share files with my other machines. Fired it up right out of the box and immediately dumped Windows S.  Removed all the Microsoft bloatware that I don't use, and this is a solid machine. This is my first Acer computer, as I've avoided them in the past due to the bad rap they had a few years ago. Time will tell how it holds up.","The build quality is pretty good, doesn't feel cheap, is is quite light. However, the speakers are somewhat lacking. The laptop boots up quite fast, and the number pad is quite useful.  As others have mentioned, the computer has some room for upgrades, for example an extra 2.5 inch HDD or SSD. However, one must unscrew the little connector for the hdd, and take off the little ribbon cable that is under the plastic. This little piece connects to the hdd\/or ssd and the motherboard. I think someone showed a video of that connector here. Furthermore it has an extra ram slot, and another 4gb of ram is available on amazon for about 21 dollars, which I believe is worth it. The bios however, does not have many options. I could not find any to create a xmp for the ram. The battery life is strange, as my laptop says it only has about 3 hour on full charge, but I recall it saying at one point it had 5? so I don't know whats going on there. Changing performance settings doesnt really make a difference. It runs games like left 4 dead 2 quite well after the ram upgrade,( but before the upgraded dont know I didnt try). Furthermore it seems to always be running around 70 degrees celsius, though ocassionally drops to around 56 degrees. I assume this might be normal, as it is quite thin for its size, and this doesn't seem to cause any issues in performance.","Nice laptop however when typing the touchpad gets in the way. Came with hard drive screws so the hard drive can be upgraded also the memory can be upgraded to 32 gigs which would help out the computer tremendously","When my wife's expensive HP laptop died after 1 1\/2 years I had to find a replacement quickly.  Came across this little gem with budget pricing and good reviews. I figured that I would buy it with an eye toward upgrading the ram and adding more storage. Upon receiving it and firing it up I was immediately wowed by the IPS screen (unheard of at this price range). It's bright and actually color corrected straight out of the box. As I was setting it up I was impressed by its speedy performance. So much so that I've decided to forgo the ram upgrade. It works well for my wife who uses it for browsing, Microsoft Office and light photo retouching. After loading up all of her documents and photos she still has 70 GB left on the ssd. To sum it up, we are quite happy with this laptop. It's perfect for people who don't game or edit videos and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg.","I absolutely am in love with this great-looking, lightweight (literally) Acer laptop!  I've had it for less than a week, and have upgraded the memory from 4GB to 16, and put in a 500GB Samsung SSD drive to compliment the one that's already in there.  The upgrades were very easy to do myself, just take your time with it and do it right - there are videos on youtube from Acer and others that show you just how to do it.  With the updates installed, and Windows \"S\" mode turned off, this laptop kicks ass!  Yes it's not the most powerful out there, but for this price you get a LOT of what you need without all the unnecessary bells and whistles.  The responsive backlit keyboard is really a joy to type on, and the trackpad accepts mulitouch gestures.  Really nice.  Would buy this again and recommend it to average users in a heartbeat.","This computer is very speedy for everyday tasks like web surfing, word\/spreadsheet processing and regular video streaming. I upgraded the Samsung internal RAM memory to 8gb for about $25, I highly recommend doing this. Not crazy about the track pad being right of center instead of dead center, but I use it with a wireless mouse, so this is not an issue for me. Keyboard is well layed out and very responsive.  Screen quality is OK, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for high octane gaming.","The laptop is an extremely good value.  The screen is fantastic.  After adding more RAM & 2nd drive, the laptop performs super well.  Initially the screen occasionally blinks when viewing video in Chrome.  But installing the generic AMD Radeon driver fixes the issue.  So what's left is very minor nitpicks. 1.  No dedicated 'Pg Dn' & 'End' buttons.  They are part of the number pad, and needs to switch mode w\/ 'Num Lock'.  I really miss the extra buttons when using Excel. 2.  No SD card reader 3.  The 128GB M2 drive is divided into 4 partitions.  With Windows being in 3rd one.  So cloning things to a larger drive is a bit more difficult."],"34":["A friend of mine has the Acer Chromebook R11 and suggested I get it because it's cheap and he really likes it. I originally was considering more expensive options, but I had tried his Chromebook for a couple hours (writing a paper using it) and I liked it too. I ordered a new one, and upon receiving it I plugged it into the charger for its first charge. The laptop seemed to work great in general when I started changing my settings and searching for websites.  However, the charger fit into the charging port very loosely, and when I moved the laptop on my lap it fell out easily. I figured I might have gotten a laptop with a faulty charging port and I returned it for a replacement. The second new Acer Chromebook R11 that Amazon sent me had a normal charging port. The charger fit well and did not fall out. But, the touchpad did not work. I tried to troubleshoot it and change touchpad settings, however every time I moved my fingers on the touch pad the cursor jumped around the screen. I ended up returning this one as well and choosing a more expensive laptop from a different company as I planned originally. My friend's Acer Chromebook R11 works fine and he has had it about 6 months. He was surprised that I had these troubles. I'm not sure what the quality control process is. It seems the experience with this laptop depends on whether one receives a fully functional one.","My previous tablet was a nice inexpensive Win 10 with an attachable keyboard so I could use it like a mini PC. It was very nice, however quickly the battery became so weak it wouldn't last more than an hour. I needed something that would last all day, be lightweight, and still be used like a PC when I'm not at home. This is exactly what I was wanting! Even though it's a Chrome OS, all of the apps you get makes it feel like a PC. Use this as a laptop, then fold the keyboard backwards and use it as a tablet. The touch screen can also be used in laptop mode. It's all very responsive. The battery lasts ALL day! Depending on what you're doing with it and how you use it and for how long, you can make it last a few days before you have to recharge it. I usually am able to use it and charge it every third day or so. This is also able to load most all Google Play apps, just like your Android phone! Sync this up with your Google account and you can have all of your bookmarks and information from your Chrome internet browser that you use on your phone and your PC. Even has Microsoft apps you can get to keep up to date on your windows PC.","We purchased this computer for my 2nd, 4th and 6th grader to share because so much homework now HAS to be done on a computer.  For the ~$200 we spent, I couldn't be happier.  Except for making phone calls, it can do everything my expensive smart phone can do.  Plus it can do most of what an expensive laptop can do.  It is an amazing compromise. On a practical note: It MUST have WiFi to get to a function point.  Once loaded it operates well without it.  I would HIGHLY suggest ensuring your Google Docs is set of Offline availability (it is found in the app under settings).  That way schoolwork can continue when not on WiFi.","This is my first review after being an Amazon prime customer for years. I am a PC\/Windows user so moving to Chrome required a lot of learning\/relearning.  Googling my questions and watching You Tube helped with the learning. I can do spreadsheets and word documents with some adjustments and downloading EXTENSIONS from the Chrome Webstore. I love the sturdiness of the laptop,  I love the long-lasting battery. The touchscreen is not perfect but functional. What I didn't know was that the Acer Chromebook cannot open password protected spreadsheets. This may be a deal breaker for some potential buyers.  I was not pleased but overcame it by  unprotecting my document. The second caveat is the PDF function. I was not able to edit PDF documents without downloading an extension which is not ideal. I also cannot apply a digitall signature on the PDF.  Have not found a solution yet. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase. It's a great laptop for travel.","We bought this laptop for our daughter as she entered her first year of college this fall and really wanted and needed something lightweight, easily transported and high functioning for all of those papers she will have to write and online classes\/quizzes\/tests she will be taking! She has had it for nearly two months now and is still absolutely loving it! It seems to run fantastically. Battery life is good. Touch screen is very responsive. And so far she has done everything from write papers and take tests, to surf Instagram and watch Netflix on it with no trouble at all! We are very pleased with our purchase! Super affordable and great quality!","I like everything about this laptop, the touch screen, lightweight, foldable, but the \"star killer\" for me is the lack of ability to print even if it is on the same wireless network as your printer!  And so far, I have been unsuccessful in getting product support.  ONLY CERTAIN LISTED PRINTERS will work with it!  Really?  I bought one of these for myself and one for my daughter.  For me, I finally bought a Brother laser printer, and it worked.  For her, why should she,..,,or anyone else...need to buy a new printer to make it compatible??  We both have a perfectly fine Brother inkjet printer.  There should be a warning label on the product about this.  I see others have had similar problems, lots of complaints on line with very complecated, multi step \"fixes\"....first of all, didn't work, second, sorry, I want to hit the \"Print\" button.  This unit does not detect my Brother printer on the network.","Chromebooks in general are not what they are hyped up to be.  Google has a long way to go with chrome OS.  At first screen looked like screen from pay as you go phones, you know, not as sharp and clear as flagship devices.  But watching some videos realized it may just be the home screen.  Works good....if you dont want to print or use alot of android apps you probly have on your phone.  Tried to print something wirelessly for over an hour and still cant get it to.  Very simple and limited on in depth control of device and OS.  As far as performance, its fast and responsive.  Touchscreen has a hiccup on rare occasion, like registering a light tap.  Big screen, 360 positioning.  It is light and a good size for any traveling.  Acer is not the problem, its the OS, takes some getting used to and needs alot of things fixed.","The keyboard  is difficult to use. I miss the [delete] key. The key to the left of the 'a' summons all the search engines. I hate that, the touch pad jumps the curser instead of smoothly moving it across the screen. I have not been able to set up my wireless printer to work with this Chromebook, and non-Google email doesn't work either. I had hoped to travel with this computer instead of a tablet, because sometimes a physical keyboard is preferable to the virtual keyboard on a tablet, but I was mistaken I'll continue to travel with my tablet. This was a Prime Day purchase, so it was cheap, but, well, it was cheap.","Bought this for school. However, I had a few problems with it. 1. Be aware, that I had some problems connecting it to my school's wifi network. I had to take it to IT, and they put Firefox, on the Google Play Store on it. Turns out that the browser always uses Google's DNS, regardless of settings. This is not a problem with the device itself, but is still something you should be aware of. I had to use an app called PDAnet as a \"bridge\" so I could use it on the wifi. I reported this issue to Google, and didn't hear anything back. 2. This specific Chromebook will have its updates ended in June 2021, which is just 2 years from now. 3. The battery is very good. The battery life is about 6 hours, which is enough for my needs 4. You have access to some games via Google Play, and you can play some Linux games on this device directly. You may be able to play some PC games via the Steam Link app, available on Google Play, if you have a beefy enough PC (not this Chromebook) as a host and a wired wifi connection for your gaming PC (not this Chromebook).","Great little device but always seems to have issues connecting to the Wi-Fi  when I open it up after putting to sleep\/closing up the laptop.  I have to reboot the device to clear up what ever appears to be causing the issue.  I verified that it is connected to the network but that doesn't seem to clear the issue.  It also has a problem using Smart Unlock when my phone is nearby and unlocked.  I have to put in my password to unlock.  That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.","This is a great inexpensive Chromebook with a lot of capability.  If your familiar with the functionality of Chromebooks and aren't hoping for a full-on laptop, (If you want a laptop, buy a laptop,) then you are going to be very happy with this purchase.  Unless for some reason this thing suddenly fails someday out of the blue.  It has been exactly as I expected if not better!","This is my first Chromebook and I was hesitant to switch from Wind*** OS because that is all I have known. I was wanting to replace my tablet. This was the perfect solution because now I have that and more.  The play store did not work right away. It needed 5 application updates and that took me a little while to figure out as I am not familiar with Chrome OS. But I had it up and working within an hour. I am not a computer wiz. It is amazing to have all my loved apps! Kindle, Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu etc. and have laptop capabilities too. Still learning OS. Love the speed. Have so much to learn. This model was a 2017 model. Price was great and Acer Products are amazing. You can never go wrong with Acer. Will update in a month or so.","My laptop is well, but the touch pad isn\u2019t working for me. I tired many things and nothing. It doesn\u2019t work for me and it\u2019s upsetting since I wasted  money on it.","I can't use any streaming services on it, ie Netflix, Hulu, Amazon video. I've had it for a month and a half and this is my third time trying to use it, the second time I just thought it was my internet connection, but there's obviously something wrong with it.","I bought this as a gift, but used it for a month to ensure that it worked well. It was my first Chromebook and I wasn't expecting much compared to my high end work laptop.  Yet, the Acer R11 paired with Chrome OS quickly won me over.  I especially liked that I could fold the keyboard away and use it like a tablet. Everything I tried worked well and I had no issues whatsoever. The only mildly negative thing I can say is that I found the keyboard a bit small compared to what I'm accustom to using.  Yet, I still liked it so much that I decided to buy myself one too.","I bought this for my husband who was playing games on his iphone.  Since we are seniors it was a little difficult for him to really enjoy the game because it was so small on the phone.  So I bought him this to use to play games, and to do email (larger print). It now sits by his recliner and he uses it everyday.  Earlier I had bought him a laptop but he found that too \"cumbersome\", it was a 17\" screen.  With the smaller screen and light weight he can hold it like a phone when playing games.  My grandson is happy too, he got the 17\" touch screen laptop.","I have had a problem with the touchpad being unresponsive on and off (and I hadn't even used it very much when it started). I was asked to send it in for repair, which I did. When I got it back I again didn't get around to using it until a month or so (after return window) and right away after about 5 minutes of using it the touch pad again was unresponsive on and off. I tried to fill out another repair request (really just want to return it at this point) & received an email back stating they couldn't fulfill that request & I needed to call them. After calling them they said I have to send it in again so that is what I will have to do which is very inconvenient. I would caution about buying such an inexpensive computer. It seemed like a good deal at the time but it's very inconvenient having a touchpad that doesn't always work.","I'd only had PC's or laptops, this was first chromebook. I love the size and the touch screen. I wanted this for traveling so I could watch movies and to carry with me easily. Very light weight. So far it has worked beautifully and I don't see myself ever going back to a lap top for my needs. Not good it you want to use for writing and storing documents is about the only negative.","During high school, I was provided a dell chromebook that was great besides having a huge bezel. After graduating, I needed my own laptop and chose to buy this one because of its great specs. This laptop is perfect for a college student on a budget since it is very affordable and has multiple features found on more expensive models. Some of the features\/main selling points for this laptop is the size (very portable and lightweight), touch screen ability, decent battery life, and decent touchpad\/keyboard. Additionally, the bezel of this computer is definitely doable, compared to the other chromebook I had used. Overall, this chromebook is a great model to buy, especially for basic college\/high school classes. For specific majors that require windows or downloading programs\/software like computer science or graphic design, this obviously won't work since it is a chromebook. But, it is great for google chrome and google docs use.","I was interested in getting this laptop because I needed something on the go and to switch into tablet mode when im relaxing from doing work. I own 3 laptops, one of them is my main high end gaming laptop and two others that are used for light computing. I would say that Acer has done a good job to make this chrome book really good and affordable for customers. I really like the use of this laptop, especially so I dont have to bring around my gaming laptop around in public and risk it getting damage. This laptop is very light weight, and YES it does last 9HR!!! I was really surprised that this laptop battery would last a long time while doing many work related tasks. So, I highly recommend this laptop if you need something on the go, or you're on a tight budget, but you want to take advantage of the features that Chrome OS has to offer. The only reason why I am giving this 4 stars is because the new laptop I received had only 1 tiny dead pixel in the bottom right corner of my screen, its no biggy but I wish I didnt receive this on my new laptop.","Please do not, I repeat do not buy this Chromebook ever. It is so extremely insufficient to use for any business purposes. The touchscreen is simply horribly and the speed not fast enough. The mouse pad is even worse. I regret ever having purchased this chrome book. Please, do yourself a big favor and buy another laptop. Anything but this one.","Would have loved this laptop if it actually worked. The keyboard lags or doesn\u2019t work.  The screen is often unresponsive and has stripes. Very disappointed. When I refunded the computer, Amazon put my money on a gift card and I am not able to transfer it to my bank account where I need it. Not sure if this is normal but there should be an option, I don\u2019t I don\u2019t want amazon gift card credit.","I now use this for my daughter in college and for my business in Las Vegas on the strip. By using the Square app and touchscreen for signature I can avoid a separate tablet or device for credit card payments. I cant use the bluetooth square chip reader yet, but hopefully soon they will have support for that. For now I swipe with no issues. I also use a Netvue video camera system for the lobby of one of my businesses which doesnt have a webversion. But guess what? I install the Netvue android app on my chromebook and i can see the camera feed from my \"laptop\" now. Same goes for Business Whatsapp application from android and so much more. All on the same device instead of my personal cell.","Unit works well, however the updating of the sofware is based on the last date of the manufacture of the firmware of the unit you have. Google gives you 6 years but I only had 1.8 years left on the updates. This applies to any chrome book so be sure to look up the EXACT model numerber of your unit on  the chromebook site to see what is left on the updates. It will continue to work after that but no updates for new app usage and no security updates","Awesome tablet\/convertible laptop. Fast, light weight, great battery, and compact. I use this mainly for responding to emails and write ups for school and work. I'm a Android fan, so it's nice to have Google Play Store on here.","I hate Chrome OS!!!  It came out late in the game and it is not fully compatible with MS Office!  Isn\u2019t Google big enough.  Their Chrome OS sucks.  So this laptop was junk!","Bought it for the wife. Kids were banned from using it as we've gone through 7 tablets between 3 kids. Wife held out for a week. Sigh. It's a rugged unit,  they haven't managed to break it,  yet.  I did install a tempered glass screen protector immediately on opening.","I just wanted a small laptop to pay bills easier than on a phone, search the internet, and look at Facebook a bit. This if perfect.  You can download any apps like you would on a phone, and it collapses so you scroll through and handle it like a tablet. Overall very happy.","Dead after just 1 month of using. Touch screen NEVER EVEN WORKED. I\u2019d recommend investing in a higher quality laptop become... well, you get what you paid for","This Chromebook has an outstanding battery life, I rarely charge it and its good for days. The touchscreen and flip mode combo are perfect for having clients sign documents on the go. The only downside is that the keyboard is not backlit but you shouldn't be working in the dark cuz that's weird fam, turn on a light. There is an initial lag upon bootup but just give it a minute and it's good to go. I have never been more content with a laptop purchase for under $250 in my life. Long live this Chromebook.","Size, weight, and functionality are PERFECT for me! I love that I can use the same Android Apps I have on my phone. Amazon Prime video is not working, but I hear its being worked on. LOOK INTO THAT! I am looking forward to starting my classes with this computer!","I use this for personal travel and to just keep around the TV room. Great for the Web, email and such. Folds back to a tablet, doesn't have a backlit keyboard. Screen colors and resolution look good and are comfortable. People don't believe it's only $200 (Prime Day price).","So far, I have no complaints with this device. Screen looks better than my big monitor, battery life is great, and it boots up fast.","I don't like the fact that I'm not able to access my play store apps not even one out of all","I really enjoy using this computer. It loads instantly, has very good resolution, and is fast.","Great price for what you are getting good performance and very slim easy to handle lightweight","Only have had less than a week, but I've gotten alot of use out of it! Love it!","My 1st experience with a Chromebook. It does what it does very well. But not a replacement for my Windows based computer","Solid.  Great touch screen and works as a tablet,  Long battery.  Happy buyer","I wish it would give me the option to flip the screen no matter what position I am in, but overall it is a great chrome book.","This has been a great add for our kids to do school work on.  IF you need a machine for just internet and email, this is a great tool for lightweight computing.","So glad that I decided to try a Chromebook. This is so much easier to use. I love the touch screen and everything about it. I also feel safer online than I did with my other OS.","I like the size of this Acer R11 and the touchscreen.  It great that it can convert to a tablet or laptop.  However the Chrome process has proven to be quite difficult for a Mac and Windows userlike myself.  The Drive app will not function in an offline mode.  Infact, nothing working off-line is working everything force's to Cloud.","very unhappy with the software and battery life. I\u2019ll be sticking to Apple and Mac from here on. Thought I\u2019d try something different and regret it","Love this laptop! It\u2019s lightweight, easy to use, and sturdy.  It runs all the same programs as a Samsung chromebook at a fraction of the price and is better made.","Ridiculously slow, must be the processor because there's plenty of RAM. Trackpad skips around and misses clicks. Whole thing feels cheap even for a Chromebook.","I bought it for me, but it wasn't to my liking so I gave it to my granddaughter was very happy to receive it and use it for her school work.","I totally love this laptop.  I use it for surfing the web.  My first time using a Chrome notebook and i am very satisfiedbwith its performance","I'm loving this little chromebook. I really needed something more tablet like, but with a keyboard ... but at the same time, I would have liked an actual windows 10, as there is JW library I wanted to d\/l & it's not taking it. Otherwise, I'm liking it!","Touch screen stopped working after a month! Bought this for a special needs child so it's useless without the touch screen. Don't buy!!!","Not great!","The best laptop i have ever bought!! It's perfect for me. The price was the second best part.","It does not work with all devices (iPhone, picture keepers). It is difficult to scroll thru photos and selecting is a little bit of a pain. It works great for Netflix and all other movie apps as well as games.","Excellent combo chromeboom \/ tablet. Bought for 8 year old and is still holding up 6 months later.","Worth it. Not a computer. But if you do a lot of business online or with Google doc's and email this works great.","Really nice laptop for the money. I really like the touch screen. So far so good","Good for everyday use. Not perfect compared with more expensive brands, but great value with the price.","Bought this for my son to use for school. Easy to set up and use. Versatile and great quality for the price.","I purchased this chrome book for my second grader, and we love it! He can use it as a touch screen tablet, propped up like a table tent, or in its full keyboard form. The battery has been lasting him for several days between charging.","This chromebook replaced my tablet for overseas travel.","Excellent for kids! My son does his homework on it.","Love the touch screen & mult-use functionality. Hold like a tablet, yse like a laptop or even stand it up like a tent on your table. It should be perfect for my 9th grader.","Great for school","So far the acer is as described.","good and fast shipment","very smooth, light and powerful.","So far so good","It's a good machine if you just need to do basic things on it","Bought this for my 10 year old son. He loves it. Speed on this is amazing. Highly recommend for the price.","My little sister complained that it was heavy but it did the job well for all of her school work.

I will probably order another for my other son.","Never got it too work.  Won't even turn on","Never had a Chromebook. Like it that I can download Google play apps perfect for what I need.","Was a piece of crap. Just 4 months old and the second row of the keyboard is dead. Basically it's useless.

Screen super sharp high contrast compared similar screen topoftheline Lenovo model Thinkpad T460s size resolution Text T460s visibly sharper size better blacks richer colors tested viewing websites pages Colors nearly angle except straighton another viewer mentioned It\u2019s pretty obvious white screen Night Mode enabled lower half blueish top half yellowish night mode Speed I\u2019m computer DAY LONG notice things like speed open site what\u2019s typical sure launching something like YouTube Gmail takes 5075 longer 2generation old laptop T460s It\u2019s also slower Macbook Air Mouse opinion inherits Linux\u2019s poor mouse support one issue scroll wheel speed It\u2019s better desktop Linux there\u2019s acceleration added scrolling wheel still slow comfortable Pros Nice grippy

screen excellent device like that\u2019s mainly used web access lot better options price range Id recommend absolutely love Chrome laptop price range opinion much better options example recently opportunity try Lenevos Flex 11 httpswwwamazoncomgpawdB07GM2J244 unit Windows pro much offer 4 gb ddr4 ram vs 4gb lpddr3 full 2 1 tablet tent laptop modes vs standard laptop touch screen vs non touch cpu clock 27gb vs 24 max quicker stronger versatileand dare say fun machine around similar price unless youre Chrome OS downloading apps Playstore everything hardwired Google ecosystem cant see best option Ranting aside unit isnt inherently bad snappy responsive enough mirrors Samsung phone android sense plently port connections usbc sd card usb hdmi functional budget friendly say screen bit con however generally dark dull Id try test drive store somewhere least comparable model choosing one works okay minor drawbacks really wanted love Lenovo Chromebook S330 want believe get good Chromebook budget Ive previous good experiences durability Lenovo laptops S330 feel durable theres lot small drawbacks add uncomfortable experience especially users accustomed higherend experience size 14inch display good size feels muted matte colors dont pop edges letters etc super sharp low resolution look angle head issues intensify build feels solid also little cumbersome heavy compared slimmer lighter competitors note keyboard side buttons feel durable also felt much rigid resistant side like use little much force type keyboard doesnt backlighting Like Chromebooks easy set Chrome OS naturally avoids bloatware boots superquickly browsing internet felt slower regular laptop running internet connection business black color acceptable though elegantlooking textured surface easy clean Battery life good trackpad works well like USB 30 port USBC port SD slot storage expansion HDMI port Overall S330 checks boxes Chromebook needs made itch luxurious features elegant design worth taking test drive see feel satisfied deliver Quick charge time battery life wifi drops constantly new Chromebooks needed something could hold surf Internet watch videos thought might fit bill really dont mind screen best perfectly fine Ive watched videos never thought twice video display quality dont really like keyboard requires lot use hotkeys use way use one instance constantly using pageUPpageDOWN buttonsEndHome doesnt Also often hard right click copy paste use Control C V lot didnt review order give time get used keyboard still prefer regular keyboard keys feels ok type though hardware works fine main problem wifi drops time fast Internet connection Im used opening least 56 pages time FORGET open 3 pages Internet ups disconnects 10 seconds open Thats fine reading forums social media good entering sweepstakes thats hobby also hard order groceries instance put 3 things cart wait 10 seconds put anything else tried disabling extensions syncing everything checking time restarting ENTIRE NETWORK changing Googles DNS servers changing power options nothing works dont many running apps dont think lack memory causing weird Fast responsive dies fast responsive dies wifi show good strength

bought laptop spent 2 hours HP customer service representative realize mechanical failure send repair disapponted Excelente computadora tenia 8 a\u00f1os de usar windows unicamnete tenia dispositos Mac quise darme un respiro de apple comprando esta computadora despues de unos dias de uso parece una computadora muy buena muy rapida ensciende en menos de 10 segundos con puntos que resaltan como los siguientes El teclado es muy comodo para escribir El touch de la pantalla lo uso con frecuencia pero supongo que habra momentos que pueda ser util pero funciona muy bien Lo peque\u00f1a ligera que es la computadora es excelente muy practica para llevar de un lugar otro La pantalla con los bordes tan delgados encanta El sonido sorprendio mucho es para hacer una fiesta pero si es un sonido muy bueno comparado con las mayorias de computadoras portatiles hablo por la calidad del sonido mas que por el volumen La calidad de la pantalla es muy buena sin lugar duda uno de los puntos mas fuertes Las cosas que quiza podrian mejorar El trackpad es un poco peque\u00f1o de alto un poco incomodo veces pero si usas mouse tendras problemas Para que fuera perfecta seria genial tener una memmoria de video de 4 gigas ya que la de 2 gigas se queda corta con muchos juegos aunque hay algunos que corren de manera descente Se que esta dise\u00f1ada para jugar pero nunca esta de mas saber que lo puedes hacer Tiene los puertos necesarios aunque un puerto hdmi nunca esta de mas aunque se que lo pusieron para mantener la delgadez del aparato En conclusion de momento esta encantando solo espero que windows sea tan estable como el sistema operativo de apple pero eso ya es problema del aparato Seguro recomiendo la compra de esta computadora Amazing laptop except battery life excited receive laptop

first impression really bad unless get replacement device contact support team Turkey see help Producto mal manufacturado falla de f\u00e1brica Estoy muy decepcionado con el producto Estuve meses buscando un notebook computador de escritorio que satisfaga mis necesidades que tenga un precio atractivo hasta que encontr\u00e9 con Acer Predator Helios 300 modelo 2019 8 La verdad que en el papel tiene unas grandiosas caracter\u00edsticas Un procesador de \u00faltima generaci\u00f3n i7 9na generaci\u00f3n una excelente tarjeta de video nivel de rendimiento nvidia 1660ti La verdad es que al parecer este computador tiene serios problemas de manufacturaci\u00f3n Invert\u00ed bastante en un notebook que fallo al segundo d\u00eda de uso corr\u00ed el riesgo ignorando los comentarios negativos esperando que solo sea un caso aislado hasta que lleg\u00f3 mi maquina fu\u00ed una v\u00edctima m\u00e1s de la mala manufactura del producto Env\u00ede el notebook al servicio internacional de Acer en mi pa\u00eds el resultado es una falla necesidad de reemplazo en la placa madre pesar de que est\u00e1 en proceso de arreglo se cual ser\u00e1 el resultado de esta historia si finalmente mi computador lograr\u00e1 estar como uno nuevo sera un arreglo que este la altura de la maquina que compre Todo esto mientras corre el tiempo de devoluci\u00f3n de mi dinero si quedo conforme se si lo arreglar\u00e1n tiempo Ped\u00ed el notebook un 5 de diciembre en un env\u00edo que pague para que llegara m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido tardo casi un mes en llegar luego falla al segundo d\u00eda de uso llevo m\u00e1s de 2 semanas esperando la reparaci\u00f3n han hecho pasar un gran estr\u00e9s sabiendo lo que pasar\u00e1 con una inversi\u00f3n grande para m\u00ed 1400 dolares el valor junto con impuestos env\u00edo yo solo quer\u00eda una maquina buena Realmente lamentable la experiencia que recibo tanto de Amazon como de Acer con un producto nuevo que debiese estar en perfectas condiciones sobre todo si es tu primera compra en el sitio Enviarlo de vuelta solo devuelven 20 d\u00f3lares del costo de casi 200 d\u00f3lares que cuesta volver mi producto fallado Espero que esta historia de terror pronto se solucione best gaming Laptop price know tons Research finally decided value metric 2019 Predator Helios 300 blue trimmed one 2019 best option esp sale 999 Comparable 13001700 gaming laptops opening playing games like RDR2 Witcher 3 Wild Hunt Rainbow Six Siege even Apex Legends highultra settings it\u2019s beautiful Smooth experience happy there\u2019s one downside make recommendation adjust 256gb Hard drive storage small That\u2019s big downside laptop that\u2019s enough room much games EX RDR2 took 140gb space alone Thus immediately buying purchase 1TB SSD 25 Samsung Evo roughly 150
