To be honest with you, that does not really pertain to me.  I have a basic understanding of what to expect with certain specs, that, like most people, slightly different computer's descriptions are indistinguishable to me.  So I won't go on and on and describe the internal specs too much in this review. Out of the box, this laptop is very light.  I was expecting a little more heft to it, but that was not the case.  Upon my initial charge, it booted up extremely quickly.  You have to go through the initial language and security setup, and then you are set to use the computer.  You have 3 options for logging in - Password, Pass-Key, and fingerprint identification (Found on the right hand side of the laptop).  I try to utilize the fingerprint, but it sometimes has issues identifying, so I divert to using another method, but that is not a big deal.  I think I probably just need to re-setup my fingerprint ID. There is a ton of storage on this laptop!  On top of the 256GB SSD drive installed, there is an additional 1 TB of internal storage to use!  This is great for my needs as I need a lot of storage for photos, documents and videos.  I had previously taken all of my documents and files from an old laptop, and transferred them to an external for backup.  When I went to transfer those files to this laptop, it went lightning fast!  I have never transferred such a large amount of data so quickly!  I was very impressed and encouraged that this was a very good quality device. The size of this laptop is slightly larger than a iPad Tablet, and is also then touch screen enabled.  You can fold it over and use it as a tablet if you desire (The screen will give you the option to use as \"Tablet Mode\".)  I can see this being good if I am travelling on either a train or plane, and space is limited.  Also good if you want to relax on the couch, and surf the internet.  A nice feature of the body of this laptop. Lastly, this has plenty of slots needed to attach external devices to it.  There are both two USB ports, and one USB-C port.  I find this perfect, as should you need more, you can always purchase an additional docking station, that you can connect and add other devices to, while not losing the USB C port.  This computer is also Bluetooth enabled.  I am not a fan of using track-pads, so I am able to connect a Bluetooth mouse to it, and save a port that way. In closing, this is a very solidly made laptop, that is both fast and practical.  The biggest pro for me has got to be the speed, both in utilizing programs or the internet, as well as transfer speeds, to and from external storage.  This laptop gets the job done, and it gets it done fast!"}, {"name": "Kate Mahoney", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "August 17, 2019", "title": "Fantastic performance for the price!  Perfect laptop for the average user", "review_text": "I went without a laptop for probably 10 years using just my iPad, but at the end of the day, there are just things a laptop can do that the iPad can't and I finally decided to buy a new one.  A couple years ago I did TONS of research and ended up buying a 15\" HP Spectre X360 2-in-1 and it has been the most incredible laptop I've ever seen, let alone used, so I am DEFINITELY convinced of HP's ability to make a great 2-in-1 machine.  My husband needed a new one so we got this for him and I compared it head to head with my Spectre and I was incredibly impressed at how well it performed in comparison when the Spectre cost twice as much as this laptop! Before I get into how they compare, I want to state that this laptop is PERFECT for almost everyone!  The only people who would probably need a beefier system like the Spectre would be those who intend to use it for: -Heavy video editing (I run a lot of Adobe Premiere Pro) -Serious gaming -3D animation -Running CAD software For everyone else, this Pavilion is going to perform like a rockstar! Here are some of the differences/comparisons between my $1,400 Spectre and this Pavilion: -Boot up times were pretty much identical (about 8 seconds), however the setup on this Pavilion was the fastest and easiest computer set up experience I've ever had! -Spectre's display resolution is higher (4K), but the Pavilion's display is still really crisp and beautiful! -Spectre has facial recognition unlock whereas Pavilion uses fingerprint unlock, which honestly works better, more reliably and faster than my Spectre's facial recognition. -The touch screen sensitivity and response to my active pen stylus is exactly the same. -Both have Bang Olusen speakers that sound fabulous for a laptop! -The backlit keyboards and touch pads are equally responsive and the keys have a great feel to the action. -The Pavilion is smaller and weighs less which is really nice for students or people who carry their laptops everywhere. In short, the Spectre is bigger (but heavier) has more storage, more RAM, an i7 chip vs Pavillion's i5, a 4k display and a beefier graphics card than the Pavilion, but honestly, unless you're doing a lot of heavy duty video editing like I am or intense gaming, you will truly not notice that the Pavilion is lacking in any way, and you'll save a LOT of money! In terms of how this system compares of other brands of laptop, I compared this with my colleagues MacBook and Dell laptops and I felt like this machine was superior to both in just about every way, especially because of the ability to go into tablet mode!  My husband is the director of manufacturing for a major company and has said that this laptop is the best he's ever used.  It's lightning fast, has ample storage and he loves the design, look and feel!  His last laptop had a shiny finish that was a fingerprint magnet and this mat finish is not at all! In summary, for the price, this is about as good of a laptop as you're going to find with such impressive specs, and I can personally vouch for HP's customer service and how well built and high performance their laptops are.  I can absolutely recommend this laptop with no reservations!"}, {"name": "Jen", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "August 5, 2019", "title": "Powerful little dude", "review_text": "After years of dealing with electronics that were absolute junk from HP, I swore I would never again allow an HP product into my house. In January I bought my mom and HP laptop, and now I have this little one. I am glad to see that HP has learned from their past mistakes and made some changes. This little laptop is fast. The touch screen is very responsive and makes it easier to use in a hurry. It easily converts into a tablet when you need it and back to laptop by just folding it backwards. I have a Toshiba that also does this, but it is much bigger and makes too big of a tablet. This HP is the perfect size. The processor and RAM can handle several tasks at once with ease. It can handle some PC games, but nothing too fancy. The keyboard is actually really nice: the keys are spaced appropriately and have a nice feel to them. The backlit keys make it much easier to type in dim light. The compact size makes it great for travel, making it an excellent laptop to tote to and from work. One thing I don't like is it does get a little hot when charging, and it charges really fast, which is probably why it gets so hot. With so many reports of batteries overheating and catching fire, I can't help but wonder about the safety of this one. I'm sure it has gone through vigorous testing to ensure it's safe, it just still concerns me. Overall,this is a powerful little laptop in a nice, compact size that isn't too thin you feel like it will break. It is perfect for work or college because of it's capabilities to handle tasks and it's easily-portable size."}, {"name": "Lisa Baker", "rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "August 6, 2019", "title": "Some Nice Bells & Whistles", "review_text": "I was looking to replace my chromebook and wanted to give this laptop a try.  Here are some specs: Dimensions: 12.73 in (W) x 8.82 in (D) x 0.80 in (H) Weight: 3.52 pounds Memory: 8 GB, not expandable Storage:  1.128 TB One of the best features is the fingerprint reader to unlock it versus typing in your password each time.  Also, the Intel processor is very quick  and the touch screen responds smoothly. I have a few issues with this laptop.  I'm having connectivity issues with the wifi adapter.  When it is connected, it works great.  However, it disconnects from wifi frequently, even when I am close by to the router. Another problem is the battery life is shorter than what I expected.  I am using it for internet research, not streaming at all, and the battery discharges after about 4.5 hours.  Finally, the fan is on almost always and concerns me that it is overheating. For the price, I don't think it is worth it."}, {"name": "Dora Explorer", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "July 29, 2019", "title": "Great laptop unless you are a serious gamer.", "review_text": "Quality laptop with solid performance specs, that's relatively compact, looks sharp, and is a great choice for everyday tasks or use. However, while it can play games, it\u2019s not the best laptop for serious gamers. Things I liked: * Compact size and thin profile. It's not tiny, but it's similar to a MacBook Air. In the pics I have it next to a Dell XPS 13\" (same size as a MacBook Air) and next to a MacBook Pro 15\".  You can see the size falls somewhere in the middle, and the width is about right. * The screen folds around like a tablet, which could be very useful for meetings or activities where a tablet would be easier to work with. (Granted, windows 10 in tablet mode isn\u2019t great, but that's not the laptop's fault.) Processing performance: *I included geekbench scores if you're into that sort of thing. Even though this is an I5 it blows previous generation I7's out of the water. I found this a little surprising. Graphics performance: * Geekbench graphics scores are included as well. This is not a dedicated GPU so it's no monster, but for integrated graphics, it fares pretty well. * Yes, it plays Fortnite just fine. Fortnite plays best on low graphics settings. The best we found though was low quality settings, resolution at 100% and full screen, not windowed full screen. This was significantly better than the default settings that Fortnite picks. * Also, the default graphics mode was for maximum battery life, even when the laptop is plugged in. I was able to get ~ 15% better graphics scores in benchmarks by opening the \"intel graphics control panel\", \"power\", selecting \"plugged in\" and changing it to \"max performance\". Storage: * The drives are about average as far as performance goes, see pics. * The fact that the laptop has two drives is a really nice feature. The SSD for the OS is a little small, but the 1TB spinning disk more than makes up for that and is fairly unique in this price range. To me this is a very good selling point. Fit and finish: * The laptop feels well built. Does not feel cheap at all. * The trackpad is better than most windows laptops. It's not as good as a mac, but as far as windows trackpads, it's the best in our house. It's on par with the XPS 13's trackpad. * The keys are nice and I can type well on the keyboard. (I'm a fast typist.) Misc. notes: * The icons are huge by default. Right click on desktop, go to display settings and scale. Default was 150%, it really should be lower. 100% is a little small; 125% is just right. When the icons were sized so large, it made the screen feel small, but it's not a small screen. * The fans are a little loud compared to the other laptops we have sitting around (which is too many dells, macs and lenovos.)"}, {"name": "diljs", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "September 21, 2019", "title": "Nice little laptop with some special features", "review_text": "I have been needing a new computer for a while, and thought it was time to graduate to a touch-screen unit. I like having a full keyboard and mouse pad capabilities, but it's also nice to be able to touch a point on a screen and go, rather than just scrolling down or using a mouse. When I first started the computer, Cortana came on and wanted to walk me through the set-up, installation, registration and whatnot on this machine. It had a nice, soothing voice that may be reassuring to newbies. However, I am not a fan of voice programs, so I deactivated this feature. There are three ways to log into this computer: 1) You can use the fingerprint reader on the side, but it does not always work for me. I suppose this will get better as I learn the precise placement over the strip. 2) You can enter a pin code of at least four digits. 3) You can enter a password. With its small size this laptop is quite portable. It will fit into just about any backpack, briefcase, satchel or even a large hand bag. The screen is a bit smaller than I would prefer, but you can adjust the font and display sizes to make it more comfortable. It is lightweight and considerably thinner than my other laptop. It has 2 USB ports, an HDMI port, a mini-USB port, a medium memory card port, and a headphone jack port on the sides. The power button is on the side, as well as a fingerprint reader for security. There is no data cable port, so you'll have to connect via USB or wirelessly to other devices or internet. Although small, this computer is mighty by way of storage and speed. It's got a 1TB SATA hard drive, plus a 128GB solid state drive. So there is plenty of storage for your photos, films, music and other files. I would prefer it if the device only had solid state drives, since they tend to last longer. 8GB of RAM provides you with plenty working memory. Unfortunately, it's not upgradable. The Intel Core i5 processor and graphics make it run nice and fast. The screen is HD, which makes for crisp, clear images when streaming movies, gaming or editing photos. This laptop comes with a standard QWERTY keyboard with numbers, soft keys, etc. Other buttons let you rewind, pause or play an audio or video clip, brighten or dim your screen, back light or turn off the illumination on your keys, etc. At the touch of a button, you can instantly place your computer on airplane mode. The keyboard, though compact, has very comfortably sized and spaced keys on it. I like that they are nearly silent when you press them, unlike some keyboards that tend to click when I type. This keyboard has an option to back light the keys and their characters, so you can type or do gaming in the dark. I like that the built-in touch pad has a lot of different gestures you can use to navigate on this computer. I don't use all of them, but it's nice to have choices. This computer is supposed to have enhanced graphics and sound system for gaming, video and other purposes. I did not notice a tremendous difference from what I had by way of image quality, but the sound was good. It's got some really good speakers on it. I was able to hear and clearly understand the dialogue of a movie from across a large room. You can mute, raise or lower the sound with the touch of a button across the top of the keyboard. The screen can be rotated all the way around to the back of the keyboard, so you can use it as a tent display or like a tablet. However, you cannot detach it. It will also auto-rotate like a tablet or cell phone, if you like. The touch screen is pretty accurate and responsive. It works great for selecting buttons, swiping, scrolling, hand-writing notes or signatures and drawing. I didn't find it works that great for highlighting and selecting large areas on the screen. Neither was the touch pad the best for this purpose. Again, that may become better with practice. The computer comes with Windows 10 Home Edition, which is designed to work with the touch screen. There really weren't any other programs installed on it. There are just links to take you to websites to access apps and programs. If you have a Microsoft account, you can log in and do stuff. Otherwise, you'll have to either pay for a subscription, work online or download what you need to do the work or activities you want to use the laptop for. Since there is no CD port on this device, you won't be able to load programs that way, nor can you play a music or video CD or DVD without an external device. The lithium ion battery in this computer will hold a charge for over 8 hours of continuous use. It recharges pretty quickly. I am concerned that the charging cable jack seems a bit loose. I worry that it may break off or the port may break in time. It is nice that the jack is at an angle, rather than straight like my other one. The charger itself is much smaller and lighter than others I have used. The price tag on this computer seems a bit steep for no bigger than it is. If you need something lightweight, compact and portable, then this may be the computer for you. Just try to get it on sale, and I think you will be happy with the investment."}, {"name": "Gagewyn", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "September 2, 2019", "title": "Good higher end basic laptop for school or office work", "review_text": "I was looking for a good basic computer, basically for email and writing.  I was possibly also looking to set up multiple accounts and let my (really young ages 1, 3, and 6) kids use the computer. For email, writing, and basic internet, this computer is fine.  I went through and installed the software I regularly use, like Open Office and that kind of thing. Pros: Suprisingly slim and lightweight.  It has a higher end feel when I'm carrying it than about any other laptop I have.  I've tended to get Dell computers, and I think HP is a bit more design oriented. Nice little details.  Like the keyboard has \"page up\" and \"page down\" buttons along the right hand side in a good place and layout for browsing the internet without looking at the keyboard and without holding the FN button. Has a touchscreen (a first for me). You can switch it to tablet mode, by folding the screen all the way back.  (And, it converts to tablet mode, pops up a message that it's in tablet mode, and locks the keyboard, so you can't accidentally bump the keyboard.) Screen does go all the way to the edge, with only about 1/4 inch to spare on each side.  So, you use the full width of the computer. Camera is pretty good quality. It also seems to do well adjusting to dimmer lighting situations.  With video conferencing such a big part of work and school and job interviewing, this probably matters more than most people tend to think looking at a checklist.  (I actually only went and checked it out, because HP makes a big deal of the camera in their promo stuff.) Camera has a light right next to the lens along the top of the screen. When the light is on, the camera is on. Camera is indeed wider angle.  If you have a group of people, and not just one, you can all fit in without too much positioning.  This could be good for family use or meetings between two remote groups. like where several people are in a conference office, and several people are off alone. Charger plugs in along the side, not the back. I find this is better for charging while using, because I don't bang the charger plug, and can tilt the laptop back while typing. SSD for harddrive makes random things fast.  Like, restart feels faster than other computers I use. Cons: It feels like this boots me off the wifi more frequently than other computers or devices.  It's very common to have to disconnect and reconnect. Fan seems to kick on quickly, so I'm not sure whether this is heating up.  It's not very loud, but I always worry about stress on the computer when the fan is running. This comes with Windows 10 home.  One huge bad thing that I don't like is it makes you register an account with Microsoft to even use the computer.  So, you have to have internet available when you first set up the computer.  Then, if you make any other accounts on the computer, you have to make a Microsoft account for each of them as well.  To register, you need either a phone number or email address, and if you don't have one, then it has you create an email address at @outlook.com .  Previous versions of Microsoft, you don't need to register any account, much less each account. I tend to register the admin account with a password, then make a non-admin account for day to day use.  That way, software installing prompts me for a password, and I feel it's harder to pick up viruses.  Also, like I'd said, I was thinking to maybe let my kids use this, and they definitely would get a less dominant account.  Having to register each user account on the computer with Microsoft is a huge negative.  This is a Windows 10 home thing, and is the future or present for now, so it will be a negative of any computer you get, but that's what you are stuck with here.  I feel the online account management is kind of awful, since my vibes are that eventually Microsoft will discontinue support for the older computers to be able to access the online centers at all, so the laptop won't be useful as a hand me down (or will be but you gotta install Linux). Couldn't get fingerprint login to work at all.  I can't on my phone either, and I feel I must have extra oily fingers or something. As far as using with kids, I had the nagging suspicion that the laptop wouldn't be a good way to go.  That's true.  For little, little kids, it really has to be a desktop to keep the computer safe from them.  Nevertheless, this has good parental controls on it.  To set up the child's account you need a phone number or email address and have to make a Microsoft account (which I hate).  Then, you really can't do much from Windows control panel.  You have to log into Microsoft's website and manage the child's account from there.  I was able to quickly block some websites, and make a list of allowed websites, which is about all I want to do (and which wasn't available in Windows XP home but has been available in every later home version of Windows).  It had some interesting things in there.  Like you can select an age level of content to allow, and I guess there's some automatic filter.  Then it had where you can add money to the child's Microsoft account and they can use it for online purchases, with an option to require parental approval at the time of purchase or not. Overall, this seems like a good basic laptop for school or business use."}, {"name": "Sleepy", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "August 18, 2019", "title": "Great for everday use", "review_text": "The laptop looks nice and sleek. It's a median sized screen, which is good on a laptop, but turns into a very large tablet. My favorite part, is the keyboard. The keys are perfectly sized and spaced for easy finger reach. Typing feels very natural on it, with few mistakes. The option to have the keyboard backlit is a really nice addition. The function keys are sensibly placed, giving options like screen brightness, toggling the backlight on the keyboard, airplane mode, volume, and video play options (fast forward, rewind, etc.) Con: the laptop overheats quickly and the fan is loud and annoying in the background. I like how easy it is to switch between computer and tablet mode. There's also an option to work as a desktop while in the tablet shape. The hinges feel sturdy enough to withstand a lot of switching. The touchscreen responds nice and quickly. It also responds to touchscreen pens, which I prefer to use over fingers, so I don't smudge the screen. The screen is nice and glossy and hasn't smudged yet despite usage. It was very easy to setup and use. The setup process barely took a few minutes. Battery life - not so great. It's down to about 25% after only about 2 hrs of constant high powered usage (gaming). It drains quickly even without high powered use. Speaking of gaming, this laptop won't work for hard gaming, but nicely runs median tiered games. If you don't have gaming peripherals, having a touchscreen helps out a bit. I love the fast bootup, but that's expected given the SSD. The speakers sound pretty good. The mic didn't pick up my voice right away, but I didn't try too hard, and simply disabled it asap since I noticed it was constantly recording all background sounds. (Hello, spies) Internet speed is great, and it's got 5G. Bottom line: I think this makes a great machine for the average home/student user. I plan to login to work occasionally, and use it for some simple gaming, home usage, and lots of internet browsing. This is perfect for students. Again, I really like how perfectly the keyboard keys are sized and spaced for speedy and accurate typing."}, {"name": "Eric K.", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "August 20, 2019", "title": "Seems Good from an Layman's Point of View", "review_text": "I only use my home computer/laptop for surfing the Internet, checking email, uploading photos to Internet storage sites, selling on eBay, and storing iTunes music (yes, I'm still one of those people who do that, thanks to my CD collection from years past).  None of this should require a lot from a computer.  So, to be honest, I don't know a lot about computer specifications, memory, processor speed, blah, blah, blah.  I only know whether a computer/laptop works well and performs the basic functions it should that allows me to do what I want to do at a good speed.  My laptop before this one was a Dell.  It worked great...until it didn't.  It is incredibly slow at only a couple of years old, even for the most mundane tasks now, and I hardly use it.  And when I do use it, it's just for the above.  I'm not doing any fancy gaming, etc. that should require a lot from a computer.  I've typically bounced back and forth between HP and Dell computers, being burned by both in the past.  So far, this little HP laptop hasn't failed me, but they're all great at first.  It's smaller than I'm used to (and my eyesight isn't as good as it used to be), but I can easily take the laptop from room to room.  I've gone from a 15.6\" display to this 14\" one.

After working with glitchy, draggy old computers for the last year or so, this is a huge revelation for me.  Not only is it fast on a task-to-task basis, but the startup and shutdown processes are incredibly fast. It's not wasting my time.  Nor does it waste my time with a lot of bloatware.  Yes there is some, but most is easy to remove should you not want it. I like a smaller screen and keyboard, so this is perfect for me, and it's lightweight and has a slim profile, so it's easy to take along when I'm out and about. I love the way it converts to a tablet when you fold the screen back. Even the fingerprint recognition is dramatically better than anything I've had before.  One thing I was skeptical about was the placement of the power button on the side. I was sure I'd be turning the laptop on or off accidentally, but I've discovered that it's not that simple, which is a load off my mind. I could wish for a couple more USB ports particularly as I use both a wireless mouse and because there's no disk drive, so I have to attach an external one when I want to access files on disk. Eh, I'll survive it. There are always work-arounds. Bottom line is that this laptop is a perfect match for me.  I'm a writer (not a gamer) and this runs all the software I need, runs it fast and efficiently, and has tremendous storage capacity for all my files. I really couldn't have asked for more.

As you rotate the screen backwards, a dialog box pops up and asks if you want to convert to the table mode.  Clicking the YES box converts to the tablet format.  Move the screen back toward the normal position and the dialog box pops up and ask if you wish to convert to the laptop mode. The convertible feature is neat, but I much prefer to work in the laptop mode. The HP X360 is a sleek looking, compact with all the features I want or need in a laptop.  It is lightweight and very thin.  The screen is very sharp and in the table mode is very responsive to the touch. The set up is fast and easy.  Setting up the computer, installing my preferred spyware, anti-virus and updating Windows took less than half an hour. The only thing I need to get used to was the touch screen.  It is very responsive but it did operate slightly different than the one I was used to. It has 8 GB of SDram (not upgradeable) but this is plenty fast for all my needs. The hard drive is 1 T solid state.  The fan does make a slight noticeable hum when the laptop is being used.

Really like the touchscreen and swivel capability to easily switch back and forth between a regular laptop and tablet.  Like setting it up in a tent fashion when I'm playing music so that the speakers are upright and facing front. This has a lot of storage space, is fast, and able to handle multiple windows at once.  I've mainly been using it to edit documents and spreadsheets, general web surfing, and streaming; and so far have been impressed.  Backlit keyboard is nice and convenient too.  Also think the size of this laptop is perfect.  I thought it would be bulkier, but it's actually got a very nice slim design, and has been really easy to just slip in and out of my bag.  So far the only thing I haven't been all that happy with is the fingerprint reader.  It's just a little slit and it had issues trying to read my fingerprint, so ended up giving up on that.

The 8gb of ram help the applications feel snappy and is sufficient for doing day to day work. This is not a gaming laptop by any means, but does feel quite powerful. It doesn't have a dedicated GPU and uses the 8th gen I5 to host the graphics. That being said the 8th gen I5 is no slouch. It turbos up to 3.9 ghz and has 4 cores, so you should be plowing through most tasks with ease. The additional 1tb hard drive helps a lot because the 128gb ssd just isn't enough in 2019.

It has a fingerprint reader on the side for easy login which is a great feature I wish they ditched the 1tb spinning drive and just put in a 1tb ssd. I also wish it had 16gb of ram or the option to add more later. For the price, this laptop is pretty great. I wouldn't nock off any stars for those two points.

I haven't spent much time with PC laptops in some years (although I do use a PC desktop), but I've been favorably impressed with the ease of setup (very simple, unless you count my frustration getting around Win 10's confusing and super-annoying requirement to download a button to get out of S mode so I could immediately download my preferred browser, Chrome--something that's no fault of Lenovo's) build quality, and responsiveness of the keyboard. The touchscreen works amazingly well, allowing you to use it as a tablet, and memory seems adequate for my rather pedestrian writerly uses (I'm not a gamer), though I believe there's one slot available to upgrade RAM if you're running greedier applications. Video ran well, and audio quality out of the onboard speakers was better than expected. A couple of USB ports and an SD card reader, along with the expected headphone jack. The solid state hard drive is a good choice for the on the go, so much more reliable than earlier styles. What didn't I love about it? The screen quality, I felt, was somewhat disappointed, the images not as sharp and clear as we're used to seeing on many desktops or laptops (and certainly in newer smartphones) these days. I'm not sure this is a sacrifice that was made due to the touchscreen functionality, or it's just a price point issue, but it was the very first thing I noticed--and I'm not comparing it to an Apple Retina display or anything special but a nearly six-year-old Macbook Air that I use daily. The more I used the Lenovo, the less it bothered, but it is not going to be the best and brightest screen. Also, the Lenovo's keyboard, while good enough, doesn't have the springy, solid feel I love, nor is it quite as responsive as I'm used to. Despite these caveats, this is a lot of computer for the money, one that would be a great choice for many students, budget users, and those without heavy graphic/gaming needs.

(Syncing passwords and bookmarks - that kind of thing.) The MacBook is hard to replace, however, because it's so insanely light - just 2 pounds. This is a challenge. My first attempt was to get a Microsoft Surface Go. Gorgeous screen, really light, full Windows, and a surprisingly good keyboard. But the performance really sucks: it has a \"Pentium Gold\" CPU, and it only clocks in at 604 on the Novabench benchmark. My work machine (Huawei MateBook X Pro Signature; core i7, 16GB) scores 1459 on the same test. And then Amazon offered me a Lenovo IdeaPad Flex14 to review. Although it's the lowest end of the (vast) IdeaPad range, with a core i3 and just 4GB of RAM, I decided to try it out. My verdict: middling. Not as bad as I'd feared from the specs, but not great. The best points: Performance is snappier than I expected (Novabench comes in at 988), and I never found the 4GB to be a serious limit. The battery life is perfectly good: I streamed a 6 hour YouTube video, and although it did pop up a battery warning at the end, the system was still good for another 45 minutes of moderate usage. The touch screen was responsive and accurate. The keyboard was adequate; there was a sense of \"bottoming out\" on the keystrokes which made it feel laggy, but (objectively) typing was just as fast and error-free. However, the screen and weight really let things down. Yes, I shouldn't expect a 1366x768 screen to compare to a 3000x2000 one, but even so, text looked fuzzy and the brightness was remarkably poor.  (Side by side, the IdeaPad at 100% brightness was about as bright at the MateBook X Pro at 40%.) And on the IdeaPad, a blank, white screen had a distinctly blue-grey cast to it. (My partner just looked over my shoulder at the screen, and described it as \"old school\" - the kind of screen we expected on a laptop 5+ years ago.) And the weight. It's 3.65 lbs., which is three-quarters of a pound heavier than the MateBook X Pro and nearly two and a half pounds heavier than the Surface Go. The idea of using the 360\u00b0 hinge to flip the machine around to become a tablet is quite impractical. All in all, it's moderately priced, and the performance is better than expected.

First, the size is ideal.  Those 15.6 computers do not give you that much more experience, and are simply much harder to tote around.  This laptop is the perfect size to retain a great typing experience, fits on a tray on an airplane easily, slides into all my backpacks, even the kinda small ones, and it's just easy to handle and balance on a leg or whatever.  The size is great. The touchscreen is responsible and looks fine.  It's not a brilliant display, but it looks good.  You can put the laptop in a tent shape for movies if you like.  Sound is average to poor, but honestly if I'm watching movies I use headphones, and if I'm at home I pair to my surround sound, so I only need the laptop's included audio for notifications. Typing is average at best.  If you need to type a lot, I highly recommend spending the same amount of money on a refurbished T440 or similar.  Same size computer, lacking the touchscreen and some of the whizbang, but with a more legitimate keyboard.  This one feels smooth and slick, and I can type pretty quickly on it, but the travel is pretty short, meaning my banging typing is not as comfortable.  the keyboard is not backlit, which is the only area I truly miss with this. Performance for webbrowsing and word processing is actually pretty good.  The included SSD helps.  It's obviously limited on RAM.  My phone has more.  This isn't for modern games.  I would caution against upgrading.  It's possible.  Lenovo solders in RAM an awful lot.  But in this case, I think the style of case really isn't one you should tear down.  Again, get the refurbished Thinkpad (something designed for more maintenance) if you plan to upgrade. I've used this Lenovo exclusively for university, browsing at home, watching movies, and Amazon reviews.  I use it with Word (not included of course) and I have really not been bothered at all my the memory being 4 gbs.  I also don't mind the small hard drive capacity, as if you're using this for web and Word, it is more than enough. Tablet mode is really cool.  The screen creates a deadzone to make it easy to hold, and the keys turn off, so it's easy to use.  I am amazed this didn't include the stylus.  it's still easy to use and I had a lot of fun doodling on this thing. I'll also add that battery life is at least 8 hours of use.  And the power brick is tiny... close to a phone's.  It's really easy to live with this. Finally, simple fit and finish.. this is metallic feeling laptop that is thin and solid.  It feels like one piece of material.  It looks classier than the price suggests.  Yeah, in a room of Macbooks it's clearly not the ritzy computer, but you can use this and not worry so much about it.  It's a terrific value.  I had to knock a star off for the typing, but it was hard to do that.  I really want to give this 5 stars just based on how it feels, but it isn't the most powerful laptop."}, {"name": "Johne3819", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "September 13, 2019", "title": "Great laptop like really great", "review_text": "I am not normally a fan of touch screen laptops, but this computer might have changed my mind.

Mentally, he is sharp and has use of one arm and hand.  Because he rarely ventures outside his care facility, his computer is his only source to connect to the \"outside world\" via the internet.  A few months ago, I discovered that my uncle's computer died.  When I learned of him being computerless, I ordered this laptop for him. Before visiting him and surprising him with this special gift, I went through the process of setting up the computer for him so it would be easy enough to \"plug and play\" when he received it.  It's incredible all of the hoops that you have to go through to set up a brand new computer nowadays.  I didn't see any way to bypass things like providing a Microsoft user account, creating a sign-in, etc.  I ended up putting in my own information because I thought it wouldn't really affect the outward appearance for another user.  Wrong.  It ended up creating more problems because it was now tied to me and my information.  I eventually was able to create my uncle as another user, then turn him into an administrator, and then remove myself.  This seemingly disconnected my information from the laptop so if anyone else logged on, they wouldn't have access to my information.  After the long 30-45 minute process, it seemed to be operating the way I wanted it to, with just a log in for him because, no, I don't know the name of his 3rd grade teacher, best friend as a child, or first favorite food.  I'm just trying to surprise him with a computer! Anyway, now that the computer was up and running, I decided to try to download the Google Chrome browser.  NOPE.  Not without having to deactivate something in the computer.  Nice new tactic, Microsoft, but not everyone loves Microsoft Edge.  I left Edge as his one and only web browser. Connecting to Wi-Fi was an easy task, as was searching and surfing the internet, which was to be the main task of the laptop.  The laptop also easily converts to a tablet by inverting the keyboard.  The keyboard then serves as a stand for the tablet portion.  A message pops up when you convert it to a tablet or back to a laptop.  It senses what you're doing and asks if you want to change the look/format of the screen to either resemble a tablet with apps or a laptop with a background.  The touch feature seems to be pretty sensitive and work well.  I separately purchased a mouse for my uncle, though, so he could have both options to operate the computer.  The laptop quickly and simply recognized the mouse when it was plugged in and immediately started working.  No need for any other further set-up. The laptop is serving its function for him, and he is enjoying being able to visit his favorite websites again, as well as communicating with people via email. By the way, the ON button is inconveniently placed on the right side of the laptop and barely sticks out and/or is visible.  I guess maybe it was put here in case you're using it in tablet mode, but I prefer when it's on/near the keyboard with an actual button that really stands out.  Because the ON button is so hard to find tactilely, I put a little sticker/note on the keyboard as to where it was on the side so my uncle could more easily find it and hopefully press it."}, {"name": "Amazon_Reviewer", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "October 2, 2019", "title": "Former iPad user", "review_text": "I have been an iPad user for many years now.

The screen is unbelievably vivid and has superb HD quality graphics.  The battery life is super long, I can use it for most of the day without any worries.  If I could change anything it would be the touchpad.  I wish it had left and right buttons instead of having to use both hands and/or double fingers to get steps accomplished.

Microsoft has done a lot of work on making Windows easier to set up and use over the years.  Most of the setup prompts allowed either voice or typing to answer the questions.  I typed everything.  Honestly I found little value in the voice setup, but maybe that is more comfortable for some people. After getting logged in, the first thing I went to do was download and install Chrome.  I'm sure Edge is great, but this computer is for my daughter and all of her passwords and bookmarks are stored in Chrome, so it makes more sense to keep it that way.  Of course, Chrome could not install in the default \"S mode\" configuration of Windows.  But it prompted me right away with the option to upgrade to \"home\" mode, so that was nice.  I didn't have to go digging for it. We also set up office, which came preinstalled.  All I had to do was enter a product key. I think it had to reboot a time or two because of some updates.  But overall the entire setup was painless. After it was all done, I handed the laptop to my daughter to use as a replacement for a very old one that she has been using for school.  We homeschool and all of her classes are online.  We both noticed that the laptop was VERY hot after this initial setup.  I was a little concerned that it would get hot often as she used it. But, so far it hasn't really gotten hot at all and it's been performing great for her very light internet and MS Office use.  At the MSRP of $450, this is a good value for what you get.  It's fast and not too heavy, has a nice screen, and the keyboard is very nice and well laid out (we both like the \"clicky\" nature of the keys). So as long as you go in knowing that this isn't intended for heavy use with high performance applications, I think you'll like this one.

Since its a Chromebook and not a full fledged laptop it can only have programs that install to the Chrome browser itself. Hard drive space is minimal so you can't download large files unless you store them on an external USB drive or portable drive. If you looking at this laptop, but aren't familiar with Chromebooks, it helps to try them out and do a little research first to see if they will work for what you need. I just needed an inexpensive computer for travel so I wouldn't have to bring my expensive Dell laptop. Its perfect for that.

Most will receive updates for approximately 6 years from the time the model was introduced, not the date that the customer acquired it.

The Lenovo 100e is a sturdy machine built to military specifications for the education market. The cover does not show fingerprints. The screen is not IPS, but is clear when not viewed from a sharp angle. There are a limited number of ports. There is only one USB port and one type C port which is used for charging. I would recommend that Lenovo add another USB port and another type C port to the right side of the computer in future iterations of the Lenovo 100e.

There, I said it.  Oh I tried to justify it. \"It's only 100 bucks, it ain't so bad\", I kept telling myself. But after a few hours of trying to get things done with the 100E, I just have to admit this to myself: it's just not a good Chromebook and a waste of a Benjamin. Let me preface this by saying that I've had probably 8 or 9 different Chromebooks in my life, of varying sizes and price points. This includes 4 different 11-inchers I've used for various purposes. I'm comparing my experience with the Lenovo with that of those other 11-inch Chromebooks. Apples to apples, and all that. It's such a tempting thing isn't it? For a hundred bucks you get a full fledged Chromebook, and it's even got 4GB of memory which is pretty much the minimum even for Chromebook.Should be at least \"good enough\", right? But jeez this thing has probably THE worst screen of all time. Everything is washed out. Blacks are barely gray. Text is slightly blurry. You can force to resize the resolution within Chrome itself but no matter what, the quality of the screen is just awful. Despite the aforementioned reasonable 4GB of memory, and a -in theory - acceptable processor (MediaTek MT8173C), it's a very sluggish machine. Even basic web browsing just feels slow, like it's fighting to pull up basic web pages. The WiFi radio appears to be a culprit as well, although I haven't run any real tests about that. Point is: even basics are slow with the 100E. They keyboard is black and the key markings (letters) are very dark, so unless you're using this in a well-lit room, you better be a good touch typist. Except of course due to the mini size of this, keys may not be where you think they are. Everything is super cramped so even if you're normally a good touch-typist, you'll be missing keys. It's frustrating but this latter issue is not confined to Lenovo, it's a size thing. What IS a Lenovo thing is the shoddy quality of the keys. Travel is weird (too high) and the keys FEEL like the cheapest plastic possible. Even for a machine that costs 100 bucks I expected more since it comes from Lenovo. But the keys on the 100E are the worst of all my 11-inch Chromebooks. Of course there is no backlighting at this price point. No surprise, and many folks don't feel like they usually need one - but you really need it with a terrible keyboard like this. The top lid is a fingerprint magnet. The body is surprisingly thick and clunky. I do love that it charges via USB-C and has 2 such ports. For this price point you can't expect miracles, but honestly, it's so slow and sluggish, I wouldn't even give this to my 4 year old. (He has a 100 dollar Teqnio Chromebook from Walmart which is astoundingly good for the money, with far better screen, better keys, and faster performance) It's too sluggish to even use as a security camera monitor. You can watch Youtube videos on it but with that awful screen, it won't be pretty. I'm keeping this as a backup to my backup computers, maybe throw it in the back of the car (without being logged in to Google account, for security reasons) or maybe I'll give it to a homeless person or something (hey, free Wifi at McD+ this 100E + free time = next great American novel),  but besides that I just can't recommend it.

The LCD is touchscreen, and below the keyboard, there is a standard touchpad and a fingerprint reader to the right side. To keep the laptop thin, some of the old ports are not build in. In most cases this will not be an issue. There are two 3.0 USB Type A ports (the end is the same shape as has been available on the computer for years) and a 3.1 USB Type C. In addition to these ports, there is an HDMI port and an audio line out. If you wish to connect, there is Bluetooth, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac WIFI. If you wish for a wired LAN connection, you will need to get a USB-to-LAN converter cable. There is not an audio line in, VGA port, or memory card reader, but those features/legacy items are worth sacrificing for the thin profile and light weight with various work-around cables available if you need to connect these ways.

It's very thin and light weight. The screen is really amazing. Its super sharp and the colors are rich and brings new life to your images. The keyboard is backlit which is nice. The touch screen is very quick and responsive. While the screen is glossy, there feels like there's a coating on it that helps keep your fingers from sliding too quickly and also to reduce prints. One thing  i was expecting is that the screen would fold back to make this a tablet but its not that kind of laptop. The speakers are located on the bottom underneath of the laptop so if its on your lap, they get muffled. The sound is on the weak side even though it has Dolby sound. I expected more from the audio and at maxed volume, it was still low. intel core i7 processor, 500gig ssd HD and 16gb ram is enough for most people but if you are looking to do heavy video editing its not made for that. There's also a fingerprint ID kind of like the Apple products have. The cam quality i felt was just ok. One thing to note is that this laptop gets super hot and i mean hot....both on the bottom and the top. My keyboard started heating up and my legs were getting toasted. There is an internal fan but i'm not sure its strong enough to tackle the heat it puts out. Comes with lots of software like games and other unnecessary stuff which is easily deleted but for the price of this laptop it should come with free Notron, not a 30 day trial and also free MS Office not a trial also. Or at least free versions that might not have every option. It was a little frustration when setting this up and finding out that its asking you to purchase/buy. Cortana talks you through the entire setup which was one of the easiest startups i've ever done. It only took about 15 minutes to complete. There were a few other features I needed to adjust like the trackpad. I like the old way that to scroll down you slide your finger down not the opposite. There are also a bunch of yes/no's that you should watch out for because windows wants to share a tone of data including what sites you go to. Be careful what you agree to when starting up. The speed of this computer is fantastic, wifi was strong and fast as well. Having the touch screen really makes windows 10 much more fun to use in my opinion. The trackpad (although i dislike them) is one of the best i've used on a laptop including a MacBook. It was very accurate and really just worked like it should. Two usb 3 ports and a usb port as well. HDMI and a headphone jack. This is definitely a laptop that you don't mind traveling with because of its light weight. Its still a full size 15.6\" so its still big but after you see the amazing screen and that its so light its not a problem. My biggest complaint is that the ac adapter is way too short.

I've bought Acer Chromebook(s) for family members since they came out and recently got a new Acer Spin for myself which I liked as much if not more than my older pro model Samsung so figured this would be a much needed update for family. I was so very wrong. First the good - this is light weight, thin and the overall display is quite nice. Set-up is a breeze. The touchpad mouse area and screen are both responsive, the fingerprint reader is weak...the one on the Spin is far better but this did the job albeit slower and more buggy. It comes loaded with some bloatware which can mostly be removed. Updates and getting everything up to speed was lightening fast. Where this fell apart was turning on the narration for use with disabled/elderly. Talk about a nightmare. Thankfully I always set up everything before handing it over because even with vision, it was confusing and ended up locking. The lag time when using touch was so bad that it would leave the user searching while giving a description several second later.....or not at all. Sometimes it would simply skip ahead.

Shockingly light, easy to hold with one hand.  This is VERY light for the size, heck, its light for any size! Its way lighter than my 13 inch lenovo yoga 730, which is 2.6 lbs....you can feel the difference! It still feels solid.  Screen is bright and punchy.  Keyboard is good, fingerprint reader is also very reliable for me so far (better than the yoga 730 for sure). It has a usb-c port, but no thunderbolt 3 which is a shame.  But at least you can CHARGE the laptop with a 45 watt usb-c charger, which is a huge bonus if you don't want to carry the small power brick with you everywhere. I do think it is a bit limited on the overall number of ports--everything is on the left side aside from the headphone jack...another usb-a or c port on the other side would have been very nice. This is a laptop that I believe has memory soldered on the board, so upgrades are more limited.  And the light nature of the build means....the speakers are pretty bad.  I have a few other laptops and everything is much louder...even if this is maxxed out.  So if you must listen with this--get headphones or external speakers. There is no active pen support....but for travel this should be a quite fine machine. I have not had a chance to test the battery life, but initial tests seem like it should last a full day under typical use. I don't know why they didn't include a num pad for a laptop of this side, but otherwise keyboard has nice travel and spacing. If you want a 15 inch in a nice travel package, this is a great deal.  I do believe the LG gram series is a bit better in terms of overall quality, but they tend to start at a much higher price point.  But the 15 inch model does have thunderbolt 3 and more internal upgrade options...so weigh in that once you make your decision."}, {"name": "Misfit", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "June 15, 2019", "title": "A.W.E.S.O.M.E.", "review_text": "I really have no words, this was a breeze to set up after I shut Cortana up (sorry, she drives me nuts).

I almost thought they forgot to put the laptop in the box when I went to open it, it was very deceiving. The sheer lightness of it makes me somewhat leery about potential damage, however I think most of that will can be mitigated with proper handling. Powering on and setting up was extremely easy. I think it took maybe 15 minutes from start to finish? The keys are responsive and have a nice back-lighting that isn't overpowered and isn't harsh on the eyes. The touch mouse pad is decent, although it tends to do something other than what I intended it to do. That may be just me, so I can't be to critical. I do prefer a physical mouse instead of track pads when it comes to computers and it's very easy to add one of your own; I highly recommend it. The touch screen is very nice, and as long as your hands are clean it doesn't retain too much in the way of fingerprints. The screen does feel 'bumpy' to me, I noticed it when playing a simple game of solitaire and i'm not sure if that is a byproduct of having a touch sensitive screen or not. The screen is responsive and fairly quick at registering my touches, and appears to be on point for where I point. Boot up speed is great, from power button press to log in feels like less than a minute. I am primarily using this computer for light duty work away from home, and for troubleshooting/ testing my 3d printers. It helps to be next to the printer monitoring whats going on and making changes as necessary. I don't think I would load this computer up with anything intensive like Adobe, I'm not sure its best suited to that. The battery life seems to last forever. I just recently had to plug it in to recharge, it feels like I haven't done that since its arrival. Sound is so so.

Everyone was raving about the Asus434, so I went for it. Since then I went through two more of the same laptop because of issues. The experience was so frustrating, and I was about to totally give up. Until out of nowhere Asus drops the C425. A lot of this review will compare the two since that was my experience. After handling the Asus434 and the aluminum build, it feels like the C425 doesn't have that. I could be wrong, but it feels somewhat plastic (and maybe it is). It still looks clean, but I noticed the difference. The screen on the C425 looks great. I don't know the specs on whether it is the same setup as the 434 (which looks amazing), but it's really nice. There's a thin black frame on the screen that I really appreciate. Having also tried out the HP x360 Chromebook, I appreciate the way Asus tries to maximize the screen without putting a thicker black frame with their logo on it. The biggest wins for me with this computer (after only a few days of having it) is that I haven't had the screen flicker randomly (which happened all the time with the 434). And probably the most important part for me is that the selling price is more reasonable (in my opinion) than what the 434 (8-gig) was/is. For a Chromebook that expensive it should handle a lot better than what it was. I will also say it's slightly lighter than the 434, which I'm a fan of. Lastly, I thought that losing the 2-in-1 feature and touchscreen would be a deal breaker, but so far it's been fine. Like anything, I guess you gotta know what you want the computer for and when you'll actually be using it. They may be deal breakers for you, but it also might be giving it a test drive to see if you can live without it. So far, after two months of frustration and research, I think I've landed on the Chromebook for me."}, {"name": "Francisco", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "September 6, 2019", "title": "Big difference with C434", "review_text": "I bought this computer because I believed that the only differences with the C434 were that this is a clamshell (no hinges), that it has more RAM and that it doesn't have touch screen. I could live with those differences. But there is another one that Asus does not advertise: the c434 is full aluminium and this is half plastic. The bottom half of the computer is made of cheap plastic instead of aluminium. I didn't want to buy a cheap plastic computer, not at least at this price point. P.S. After a couple of weeks I can add: 1. At 399 the half plastic design is more understandable (but It cost me a lot more so I am keeping my rating). 2. Everythings works fine save for the Wi-fi. Many times my computer can't connect to the internet while my phone does.

I see a lot of reviews comparing this to the Asus C434, but since I've never used one of those I can't make a comparison. I briefly used a cheaper Asus Chromebook (C423), but the display on that was so bad it prompted me to return it for this model. The C423 had washed out colors, a lower resolution, and terrible viewing angles. This display has none of those issues. Colors a good and viewing angles are comfortable regardless of the angle you have the hinge open to. The Core m3 and 8GB of RAM may be overkill since I'm mainly using this for the web browser and watching movies, but coming from a gaming laptop I'd rather have the extra power and not need it than vice versa. All that plus the baklit keyboard makes this everything that I was looking for in a Chromebook. My only criticism is that the bottom of the Chromebook gets somewhat warm while charging, and VERY warm whenever I'm watching videos. There are no fans on this thing to cool it, so if your intention is to set this on your lap and watch videos you'll want one of those laptop cooling pads to set it on or it will get uncomfortable."}, {"name": "awneaz", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "September 15, 2019", "title": "Good quality device for the $399 sale price", "review_text": "General impression is good for the price I bought this for ($399 on sale).

Construction: Very solid, despite it being a plastic body (not aluminum like C434). Good fit and finish. Design is very attractive. Keyboard: Sturdy keys with good amount of travel and feel. Track pad: Surface area is large. Material is plastic and not as smooth as glass versions so I would advise using a mouse for extended use (which I was planning to do anyway). Sound: Won't blow your mind, but volume is loud and satisfying. Speakers face down underneath device. Screen: Narrow bezels are great. Matte surface with minimal glare.

I had trouble viewing the keyboard, especially with the backlighting on as other reviewers have noted. The characters on the keys are cutouts, like a face carved in a Halloween pumpkin, so there is no contrast in a non-dark room when the backlight is on. You can't read the keyboard! If you turn the backlight off, every little ray of ambient light that reflects on the keyboard also kills the contrast and makes it unreadable. It's awful. Had I used the C425 for a minute in a store, that would have been a deal-buster. However, I tried to work past that by taking it with me to my usual locations where i work. The long and short of it is that the C425 does a poor job of pulling in WIFI connections. With my old HP chromebook, I had no such troubles at the exact same locations where the C425 can't find a connection. I *REALLY* wanted to love the C425 but that was a  deal-buster. I packed it up and sent it back.  I see from the comments above that others have experienced the poor WIFI reception, too, so I suspect it's a design/construction flaw, not a problem with my particular unit.

Switched from laptops to Chromebooks.", "review_text": "There are lots of great articles and videos online that give overviews about the technical differences between a PC and a Chromebook. I wanted to avoid technical jargon and break it down for the average joe. Keep in mind that this is a mid-range price point for a Chromebook, so there will be tradeoffs. Overall, the Asus Chromebook C425 is a unique find when it comes to the Chromebook market. Usually at this pricepoint, you see more aesthetic features (slim profile, touch screen, 360 flip) and less computing power. However, this is actually the opposite. With this model, you are getting better computing power  (needed for large applications like video editing, data computation, etc), with not as many aesthetic features. If you want a Chromebook with more computing power, this is a great option at a great price. If you are looking for something more stylish and flashy, there are alternative Chromebooks on the market around the same price point as well. Auto Update Expiration Date: With Chromebooks, you don\u2019t get updates forever (like a phone). Updates will stop being pushed out to your chromebook based on when it is released, not purchased. The Auto Update Expiration for this particular Chromebook is June 2024. Set-up: If setting up a new computer stresses you out, you will love this. It\u2019s as simple as unboxing, powering on, and creating or logging into an existing google account. After a few automatic updates, this was ready to go within 3-4 minutes. A few demo videos pop up to walk you through the different features, so you can just sit back and relax. Start Up/Opening apps: Starting up the laptop from sleep or powering on only took a few seconds. It keeps up with a lot of modern tech. From startup it took about 3 seconds. From sleep it only took 1.5 seconds. Opening apps took just over 1 second. Look/Feel: This Chromebook has a very generic aesthetic. The top is aluminum, while the bottom is plastic. It is comparable to many department store laptops. This has a slim profile, but it\u2019s on the thicker end of Chromebooks with slim profiles.  Overall, it looks modern and new but it isn\u2019t going to impress anyone with its appearance. Screen: The screen resolution is typical for the price point. This has a matte finish over the screen, which is great for reducing glare. The screen has the typical 1920 x 1080 resolution. I would describe the resolution as clear, but not crisp. The thin bezel (border) makes the screen look large and impressive. It is comparable to most screens out today. Sound: This has a nice sound quality and clarity. At maximum volume, this can fill a small room but sounds quiet in a mid-sized room. The speakers are on the bottom sides of the Chromebook. Sounds even better when using headphones. Keyboard: The keyboard layout is slightly different than laptops, which to me is the biggest day to day difference in owning a Chromebook. Most of the top row keys (\u201cF\u201d keys) have been replaced with quick function keys that turn up the brightness, volume, etc. The CAPS lock has been replaced with a key that launches a search menu. If you prefer the CAPS lock key, you can go to the settings and change the function of the keys. It\u2019s simple to do. The backlit keyboard looks very sharp. It has a beautiful luminosity in the dark. However, I find the letters on each key difficult to read during the day when they are lit up via the backlight since they are clear. You can change the backlighting by holding alt + screen brightness button up or down. It is a bit annoying to toggle back and forth depending on what lighting you are in, but it\u2019s not a deal breaker. Battery: I got on average about 10-11 hours of use between web surfing, streaming, working on documents, etc. Streaming: I have subscriptions to 4 or 5 of the most popular streaming services. I had no issues with buffering or delayed loading times. Once I clicked a video or movie, it streamed all the way through with no problems or lagging. Of course this is also dependent on the internet connection you are using. Web Browsing: I surfed the web on the Chrome browser that is already installed and had no issues or crashes. I could have more than 10 tabs open at once, and it was still lightning fast. Documents,Spreadsheets, Slides, etc: Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides all come preloaded on the Chromebook and are free to use. They are compatible with all of my existing documents and spreadsheets. I am able to use these apps offline too, which is great for traveling or working outside. I use these apps for  writing papers, keeping simple spreadsheets, and presentations. Nothing that requires a high computing power. This is definitely all that is needed for average people and students. Experience Switching from a PC to a Chromebook: I recently switched from PCs to Chromebooks. I was afraid that I would regret the decision, but haven\u2019t looked back. I felt I had a full grasp of the operating system and functionality within 24 hours. For the average Joe, Chromebooks are a great option. Problems: I haven\u2019t had any problems with this Chromebook. I will be sure to update my review if I experience any issues with hardware, crashing, etc."}, {"name": "rjc0703", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "September 13, 2019", "title": "The C425 is good for a Chromebook", "review_text": "No complaints.

It replaced an Asus Chromebook C423NA, which was my first foray into Chromebook (June 2019). That earlier Chromebook was good... but because I rely on a few key Linux programs (including a GIS heavyweight, QGIS) it wasn't keeping up. And a few Android apps that I rely on were not running fast enough (i.e., Evernote). Also the screen was so-so, with a lower resolution. Then I saw this C425 on sale at Amazon. Twice the RAM, much better screen (1080), better processor. And that has made all the difference! This Chromebook is amazing for the price. Everything works so much better and looks so much better on this Chromebook! Then you add the backlit keyboard and it makes it a winner. My only complaint is the rather cludgy power supply: it is the same size as the C423NA, but with a much thicker cord from the power supply to the Chromebook AND a very thick ~30\" 3-prong power cord. Don't know why they did that. Fortunately, it still tucks away in a slim laptop bag that I got. That is why I couldn't give it a 5 star rating. - Battery life is very good (8-10 hours) - Performance is very good. Obviously, this is not for heavy-duty gaming.... but it handles everything else very well. - The screen is not a touchscreen, but that's not a problem for me, as I'm a touch typist. I have an Asus Windows 10 laptop with a touchscreen and I rarely use the touchscreen on that device. Other than that, the screen is clear and bright, with good color rendering.

In fact the bezels are smaller on the C425's matte screen, and I didn't realize how much I missed the softer glow of the matte as opposed to the ubiquitous glossy that Apple dictated we should all embrace. In my experience the battery life of the C425 is better than the MBP. The computer is blazingly fast (the intel core M3 is way more powerful than required to run Chrom OS).

The C425 would be a great choice for students who use the Google Drive ecosystem to complete their homework and communicate with instructors. It would be a good first laptop for users intimidated by Windows 10 or Mac operating systems. And it is an inexpensive basic laptop for travelers who may want to leave their more expensive ones at home. Chromebooks in general have their limitations, but for general use they are wonderful. Chromebooks do not have CD/DVD drives nor can you add software not found in the Google Webstore. But if you want to enjoy web surfing, email, social media, Netflix or basic office tasks, a Chromebook is probably enough for you. The Asus Chromebook C425 is an everyday workhorse that runs on WiFi and web-based apps, but it's also a great choice for entertainment. While not perfect, it's a very good choice that most users will appreciate. ------------------------------------------ \ud83d\udccc Out of the Box: There's not a lot to it. The C425 Chromebook, the power supply, and very little documentation. You plug it in to charge it and push the power button to get started. If you don't already have a Gmail account, you may want to consider setting it up before you fire up this Chromebook as it runs using the Chrome operating system and syncs with your Google account (if desired).  You can also log in as a guest, but you won't reap all the benefits if you do it that way. You will also want to have your WiFi password handy as this Chromebook connects wirelessly. It does not have an Ethernet (wired) port. Once logged in and connected via Wifi, the Chromebook will automatically update itself.  It will do this in the background whenever you are connected to the internet.  This updates the operating system and integrated security features. ------------------------------- \ud83d\udee0 Build-Quality, Features & Perks: The Asus C425 is one of the best-built Chromebooks I've ever used. The chassis has virtually no flex, despite being made of plastic that looks like brushed metal.  The keyboard, which is backlit, is great to type on and feels very much like my desktop keyboard - which I like. The backlit keyboard has 1.44mm of travel, which felt very much like my desktop keyboard and I liked that!  Having backlighting on a keyboard should be standard, but it's not, so this was a much-appreciated feature to find on this Chromebook. I did think the color of the writing on the keys was so subtle that in daylight they were a little tough to read, but if you are a touch typist like me, that won't be an issue. And when backlit, it's a non-issue for everyone. The 14\" 1080P HD matte-screen looks good from all angles. It doesn't wash out if you sit to the side and it's plenty bright at full brightness, but can easily be adjusted for viewing comfort. Night Mode allows for those who find looking at a monitor all day strains their eyes, a break from the blue light. The bezel around the screen is about 1/4\" wide, making the display appear a bit larger than expected. The sound from the two downward-facing speakers on the bottom of the laptop are pretty good. I enjoyed hours of Netflix viewing and never wished I'd used my earphones instead. When I tried using my Bluetooth connected earbuds the sound was OK, but I actually preferred not using them as the sound from the onboard speakers seemed to have more depth of sound than my earbuds which surprised me. Battery life is estimated to be up to 12 hours for the C425.  I found it was just over 10 hours for my first use, but I still had a little juice left and probably would have gotten 11 if I'd turned down the brightness and stopped watching videos.  Depending upon how you use it and what processes are going on, you can probably eke out 12 hours from this battery which is warrantied for 1 year through Asus.  This Chromebook comes with a 1-year International warranty through Asus. A nice surprise was the inclusion of a microSD card slot. This allows users to add a card (not included) and expand their onboard storage space for photos, documents, music, and movies without connecting an external USB drive or using up cloud-based storage space. This Chromebook comes with apps installed and there are more in the Google Web Store. YouTube's app was already installed, but I added Pluto TV and Netflix right away as I'm a cord cutter (no cable TV) who uses streaming media services to supplement my over-the-air TV viewing.  Pluto TV is free and worked very well, as did Netflix and YouTube. I have high-speed internet that runs up to almost 100Gbps, so streaming media is no problem for me even with multiple devices on my home network. I found that the C425 ran flawlessly without dropped Wifi signals and watching streaming media a joy with this Chromebook. The C425 has a great combination of 8GB of RAM (memory) and a 64GB (flash) drive.  The combination of hardware and the Chrome operating system work well in this Chromebook.  It's got zippy performance and seemed stable as I moved swiftly through various applications. This is not a touchscreen laptop. For me, that's not a big deal. It does lay flat if you want it to, but without the touchscreen, I really don't see the point. Google Drive is the backbone of the Chromebook. It's perfect for students, home users and some business professionals, and it's free to use. There are also free apps for Microsoft Office products in the Web store if desired, and Google Drive can open and work with formats used with Microsoft software. You can save documents for offline viewing and editing too, so you don't always have to be connected to Wifi. You get 12 months of 100GB of FREE storage space on the Google One cloud with the purchase of this Chromebook. That becomes 15GB free after the first year or you can pay two dollars a month for the original 100GB.  You can get a little break on that price if you pre-pay for a year at a time.  For three bucks a month you can get two hundred GB a year and again, a little price break for prepaying. -------------------------------------- \ud83e\udd28 What could be better about the C425: The webcam is awful.  Only 0.9 MP produces grainy looking video at 720P, particularly in low light conditions and the still photos lack clarity as well. While I don't use webcams very often, it's nice to have one that's decent. This Chromebook requires an external (USB driven) one if you want clarity in your photos and video. The chassis being all plastic isn't a big deal to me as it's not cheap plastic that easily bends, but for some, this will be an issue. The lack of an HDMI port is puzzling. I worked around it by getting a USB-C to HDMI dongle. I guess there had to be a shortcut or two somewhere and this made this list.  Only one USB-A port is also somewhat limiting, but again, a hub for more ports is possible. ------------------------------------------- \ud83d\ude0e It's not perfect, but I like it a lot and recommend it to others! Overall, I really like this Chromebook and I'm impressed with its performance and build quality. The C425 hits a sweet spot between rock-bottom, barebones Chromebooks and all the bells and whistles. While it lacks a good webcam, an HDMI port, and a touchscreen, it provides users with a very lightweight mobile office and entertainment laptop with storage expansion, a good display, and sound. ----------------------------------------------------"}, {"name": "Fernando r.", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "November 19, 2019", "title": "Not bad", "review_text": "Not bad for the price"}, {"name": "Carfo", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "September 19, 2019", "title": "My first Chromebook, excellent device! -- effectively replaced my iPad, but it does have some flaws", "review_text": "I was skeptical about the usefulness of Chromebooks. As an IT specialist, in my mind, Chromebooks were relegated to Classroom settings as I perceived them as a strictly google account-linked, cloud based Web Browser/Word Processor. In a sense, they still serve this purpose primarily but they can also do much more than that. This model is going to be compared to the ASUS Chromebook 434 as they are similar in a lot of ways, but also have noticeable, and for some, deal-breaking differences. Unlike the 434, the chassis for this laptop isn't made entirely out of aluminum. Instead, only the top half is, not including the hinge covers. Everything else is made out of plastic, including the touch pad, which ideally should be made out of glass. I'll talk more about the touch pad later. It's not subpar plastic, but this notebook would be made so much better if it was made entirely out of aluminum like the 434 is. The 434 has a touch screen--this does not. This could be a deal-breaker for a lot of people, as Chromebooks have access to the Google Play store, which is primarily designed around touch screen phones, so not having a touch screen breaks or limits a lot of functionality with Play Store apps. It also does not fold completely around into a \"tablet\" mode--the farthest it can go is to lie flat (180 degrees) as I've shown in the picture. When I was lying in bed watching videos, I really wanted to flip this thing completely around and hold it in a tablet-style mode, despite my original thinking before I used it that it wouldn't bother me so much. The last difference is the brightness of the screen. The 434 is almost twice as bright, however the screen is still very usable and quite good being a 1080p IPS display which incorporates anti-glare that the 434 does not. The keyboard is a highlight of this notebook. Key travel is nice and you get a solid feel of each key every time you press down on them. It's very easy to type, though from certain angles in the daytime, it's hard to see the letters on the keyboard unless you're staring straight down on it. Once you get used to the layout this isn't really a problem though. The touchpad is large and has multi-gesture support, so you can easily scroll by dragging down or up. It's not very accurate though--it feels like a chore sometimes to use the touch pad, and given that the one type USB-A port is on the left side of the laptop, I recommend sticking a wireless receiver in that port and buying a wireless mouse if you plan on traveling with it. I also recommend buying a carrying bag for it. Despite it advertising as a 14'' notebook, it actually measures 13'' across due to the thin bezels (\"nano edge\" as Asus calls it) around the screen, so a 13'' notebook bag will be ideal. Instead of having F1-12 keys and a Function key like you'd see on Windows laptops for controlling things like screen brightness and so on, this notebook has a Back button, a Forward button (identical to clicking on the back or forward button on a web browser), a page refresh button (identical to F5 on a windows keyboard), a full screen button (identical to F11 on a windows keyboard), a task view button (not sure what it's actually called in Chrome OS but it's  identical to task view in windows 10), screen brightness down and up buttons, volume up and down, and a power button. Each of these keys can be pressed without having to hold down any kind of \"function\" key. Additionally, when holding the power button, you can select to Power Off, Lock, or Log out. Powering off the notebook is as simple as holding it down for a few seconds until it goes black. There's no waiting for \"shutting down\" like you'd get on a windows machine. Onto the OS itself, this was the most alien part about it for me, but it's actually incredibly simple and easy to manage. There's a \"start\" menu, which allows you to look at your apps, search for anything on the laptop including OS settings, or do web searches. There's a taskbar, where you can \"pin\" apps, similar to Mac OS, the home bar of an iOS device, or even the windows task bar. On the bottom right, there's a visual indicator for notifications, wifi signal strength, battery life, and the time. Clicking on this brings up an additional menu where you can software turn off, lock, or log out of the laptop, access the settings, turn the wifi/bluetooth on or off, access the nightlight, brightness etc... The settings of the OS is like an expanded version of the settings you would use in a Chrome browser, that is to say it's very easy to manage even for someone not computer-savvy. The ease of use with this makes Chromebooks ideal for a child's first computer, given that it is much more secure from a virus/malware perspective and a lot easier to use, yet for someone as fluent with computers as myself, it's also a great tool for me as it's become my go-to notebook for work, especially when traveling due to how lightweight it is (2.9 lbs!). Since it has the ability to use Microsoft RDP or VPNs, I can easily remote into my work computer or connect to my work network to do work-related tasks. The speaker quality is sub-par, but usable. For some reason they put the speakers underneath the laptop (I've attached a picture for the location), whereas they would have been much better placed on top. This does have bluetooth though, so I recommend headphones for any kind of task where audio is important; but for simple video watching in bed or something the speakers do a sufficient job. One of the great things about Chromebooks in general, specifically this one, is how incredibly snappy and responsive this is. Aside from using flash storage, the Chrome OS is incredibly lightweight and doesn't have a lot of the overhead that a Windows OS does, so you don't need a ton of powerful hardware to have a fast computer. However, this notebook has a core m3 8th gen processor (comparable to an 8th gen i3 processor in terms of performance) and 8 gigs of RAM. To me, this is overkill, but it also allows for having a lot of tabs of Chrome open and applications running in the background without slowing the laptop down. The processor is so quick in Chrome OS that clicking on Chrome opens the web browser in a literal blink of an eye--and I'm not being hyperbolic. It opens Chrome faster than my gaming laptop does which has an i7 processor and 16 gigs of RAM. Booting up and shutting down takes only a matter of seconds. I use this for work, but it's also a good entertainment machine. It runs youtube videos flawlessly, has apps for video streaming platforms like Netflix and social media like Facebook, and can run anything in a web-based mode that Chrome could do on a windows machine. Documents and apps can be stored locally, but it's recommended that you utilize the Google cloud feature as this comes with a 100gig 1 year trial. If local storage is your thing, and you start to run out of space on the internal flash storage, it does have an SD slot to expand storage. Speaking of the ports, there is one USB-A port and two USB-C ports, which are highly versatile ports which can be used for a multitude of features when compared to USB-A. Besides the one USB-A, two USB-C, there is also one micro SD storage slot and a multi-purpose headphone/mic 3.5mm port if you desire to plug in some headphones and/or a mic and don't want to use bluetooth. USB-C has a much faster transfer rate and can even output to monitors. USB-C is also how the notebook charges. The USB-C ports are located on each side of the notebook which is a very thoughtful placement. The charger itself can separate. This is either good or bad for you. Typical laptop and even Chromebook chargers have the brick with the 3 prongs sticking out. This makes it a bit harder to fit inside a standard power strip especially if you have other things plugged into it. With this design, it has the usual small 3 prong end which can easily fit and not interfere with other devices plugged into the strip while the other end connects into the brick. See the picture for reference. Besides just being a web browser / word processor / application device, current versions of Chrome OS let you install a Linux virtual machine onto it, though it is currently in Beta as of this review (9/19/19). Having Linux, thus terminal, greatly expands the functionality of this notebook as now you can run Linux applications directly on the notebook using virtualization technology. I was able to install and use the Linux version of Visual Studio Code with no issues, though I haven't tested more applications. Note that you do need some basic knowledge of terminal commands in order to install the applications, but if you do a quick YouTube search can take care of this for you as it's incredibly easy and only takes a few minutes. In summation, I'm very satisfied with this notebook. There are some flaws that keep it from being great, such as a lack of a touch screen, lack of a 360 degree hinge to fold it all the way back, and a plastic base, but it makes up for it by being a good price point (anything $399 and under is a good deal) with very good hardware for a Chromebook. If these flaws are a deal-breaker for you, I'd recommend looking at the C434 or the upcoming C433. They are more expensive when you compare hardware-to-hardware, as the base 434 only comes with 4GB of RAM, although you can pay extra for an 8GB version; but for those who can't live without a touch screen or a 360 degree fold, I would hold off on getting this laptop and investing a little extra into one of the other models."}, {"name": "builder1650", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "August 31, 2019", "title": "Keep in mind this does not fold or have a touch screen like the c434", "review_text": "If that matters to you.

I do not use this for work or gaming, I have a desktop for that. I was using a tablet, but honestly I hate it. I just can't adjust to typing on a touch screen, I want a real keyboard. I also hate fingerprints on my screen. I deal with it on my phone, but for a larger screen it makes me crazy. So I figured this would be a good solution, when it popped up for review. It fits comfortably on my lap and the screen is small enough I can see over it to watch tv, but large enough it is easy on my eyes. So far its been great, although I miss the left and right mouse buttons built into the touch pad area of most laptops. Maybe its a Chromebook thing, but I will just have to adjust. I will say though it does feel a bit flimsy. I like the lightness, but in my lap typing I can feel the plastic body flexing. For the price I'd expect something a bit more durable, at least for the bottom half with the keyboard. The keys are responsive, although I'm use to my mechanical keyboard so switching to the thin chiclet style makes them feel mushier than they probably are. For a small laptop, they don't feel cramped and they are raised enough that I'm not miss-typing. It was incredibly easy to set up, just entered my google log-in info and poof I was up and running.

I plugged in the power module and powered on the machine.  Set up was coordinated by Cortana and was so simple I had to laugh.  Once setup was completed I began looking at the already loaded apps.  Some I think will come in handy, others not so much.  Removing (uninstalling) those that I didn't want was easily done right in the windows menu. Adding apps from the windows store is easy, but if you want to add third party apps, you have to jump through a few hoops to turn on that feature.  Once that was accomplished, I was able to install Firefox.  I use other apps that will go on this week. I noticed several complaints from other commenters that the machine got too hot.  I didn't have that problem.  The laptop did get warm, but not overly so.  I have a lap table that I've used in the past eliminating the need for any laptop to sit directly on my legs.  Using it allows more airflow to the machine and provides a more comfortable \"table\" for the machine to sit on. The touch screen will take a bit to get use to.  I've used an iPad for years which has a completely different touch interface.  This is my first touch screen laptop.  I think I will enjoy that feature once I get my fingers to respond correctly. The one issue many might find cumbersome is the slow internet interface.  For some reason this machine doesn't communicate well with my router.  Ironically I challenged it against my iPad and found it took almost twice as long to load pages that the iPad had no problems with.  Thankfully this machine is a backup to my office desktop so I won't be on it all day long. I do wish it came bundled with a USB DVD player/burner for loading software/apps and playing movies as well as an rj45 jack for direct connection to the router. The hard drive is somewhat small compared to other machines on the market with only 128 meg of storage.  Most other machine have at least a half meg or more.  That fact may cause grief for other prospective buyers. For me, this is a good machine.

Why a touch screen? My kids have to take computers to school. Their school does not allow lockers, so they must carry all of their books all day. Space and weight in their back packs is a premium. Last year I sent my oldest with an 11 inch chrome book. This Dell 14 inch notebook is so much nicer. It has a touch screen, so the screen is glass like an iPad or tablet. It\u2019s resolution is much higher than the old chrome book, not 4K, but for a mid priced, all in one, hybrid tablet/notebook, the resolution, weight, and features are fantastic. I\u2019ve heard it said, \u201cthe jack of all trades, but the master of none\u201d. It\u2019s a fair statement, and it holds true here. But a device does not need to be the master of all devices to meet your needs. For us, evaluating what we need, and finding it in a price that suits our budget is important.

It\u2019s screen has a luxury feel, and it\u2019s streaming quality is great. It\u2019s ability to fold completely in half to become the largest tablet ever, or sit upright like a laptop, makes it infinitely more useful than either device separately, while keeping bulk and heft to a minimum.

It doesn't have a CD drive(which probably won't matter to most, with streaming being more popular these days, but I like having this feature), nor does it have a side number panel on the keyboard. My husband has been mainly using it to turn in reports for work purposes. His needs are super simple, so he didn't need anything incredibly fancy. It's worked pretty well for him. That said, he really misses having the side number panel on the keyboard, since this is how he typically types in numbers. I've used it a bit for review purposes, but my needs are simple, like his. Other than it feeling awkward to type on the keyboard and moving slowly at times, I've been mostly pleased with it. While my children mostly use our larger family computer for school work, we like having this one around for that purpose if need be, too. That's where this one's touch screen comes in especially handy. With sites like ABCmouse, the touchscreen is easier for them and when they've used this one, they've did well with it. The battery life has been excellent so far, and we're happy about that.

The price point is already enough to have Windows 10 built in, but instead, you are stuck with a limited computer that only allows \"approved\" downloads until you upgrade. NOT happy. This has gone from a 4 star review, to a 1 star. ORIGINAL REVIEW I have been using Mac for a realllly long time.  This took me a bit to get used to as the windows processor is not something we are familiar with. However, it's very intuitive and easy to learn. I really love the touch screen and the multi ability to use as a lap top as well as a tablet. It's easy to throw in my backpack and take with me on trips and on the go. The design is beautiful and it fires up fast. It would be great if it came with a tablet pen, but that's not always a given when you buy a tablet. My daughter loves it for research and I love it for everyday online activity. The speakers are great, the screen is bright and beautiful. Overall a very reasonably priced laptop/tablet that serves our needs well. I would prefer a larger memory which would help with editing but for every day basic computer use this is a top of the line machine.

Also there\u2019s an irritating watermark about me needing to upgrade something or download some windows thing, and I really don\u2019t know how to make it go away. The usual abundance of pop-ups are also irritating, but it\u2019s not the end of the world. As far as speed goes, I recently had gotten another Dell computer that was quite a bit more expensive (about $400 more) than this one, and yet it was significantly slower. This one\u2019s not exactly fast either, especially if you\u2019re trying to do online classes, but it\u2019s ok.

The simplicity of this thing is amazing, I have an expensive Windows 10 PC that drives me crazy, I find Windows has become a very intrusive and confusing computer, that bothers you with a load of notifications and pop ups. Trying to figure out how to disable all that stuff is a real pain, Windows seems to bury all those settings, making them hard to find.  This Chromebook is none of that, the ease of this is like using a smartphone. I have absolutely no problem with the screen resolution , it looks fine to me. I can't comment on the battery life because I've yet to unplug it, I use it strictly as a stay in one place computer (plugged in all the time). Google Docs and files take a little getting used to if you never used them, but once you get used to it you'll have no problem. It was not a problem for me because I was already use them on my iPhone . You can't download outside programs because its a closed system, to me , that's a good thing because I only use it to surf the web, shop, emails and files. And because you can't download programs your not gonna pick up any viruses. If you need to edit any photos you can always download a photo app from the Play store. I've found the storage and speed for this to be just fine, it doesn't seem to slow down with numerous tabs open. You have a load of apps to download from the Google play store that should keep you happy. I don't use it to stream movies or play games so I can't comment on that, I'll streams stuff from YouTube with no problems at all. If you want a laptop to do just the basics like I do, then you can't go wrong with this for the price. To me it's way better then one of those low cost Windows PC's. I had a low end Windows PC that I bought  as a extra computer for me to use when my wife is working on the expensive PC, I hated it so much I gave it away before it was a month old. Besides being intrusive and confusing, it was slow as crap. This Chromebook is like having a giant smartphone with a keyboard, (IT'S THAT EASY). The only reason I took away one star is because I think it could of used one more USB port, other then that I love it, and if you use a computer like I do, you will too. PS. Keep in mind that this model S330 comes in different specs. My review is based on the model with the higher resolution screen  (1920 x 1080) and more memory (64gb).

The panel is reminiscent of what you'd see on a Windows XP era laptop. No matter what angle you choose, it looks washed out. Some colors are so undersaturated that it's hard to see gradients. Lenovo's decision to put a non-IPS display on the S330 is baffling. It's a real shame too, because otherwise, the S330 is a very nice Chromebook for the price. The keyboard feels great, the trackpad has an amazing texture, and overall the build quality is quite good. However, without an IPS display, it's a new car with an engine from the 1970's.

I paid almost the same price back in 2015 for the Toshiba that I did for the Lenovo. I was hoping to find a similar quality machine and boy was I wrong. Here are the main issues with the Lenovo. Screen Quality - I have no idea what Lenovo was thinking with this screen. You have to have the perfect angle to see anything, and even once you find that angle, it still looks like garbage. The colors are always washed out, black text on a white background looks almost grey. This is embarrassing for a lcd screen made in the past 10 years. Speakers - I listen to a lot of videos and music on my chromebook. My old Toshiba had amazing sound for a chromebook, and I was not expecting to find the same quality without paying for it. But the \u201cspeakers\u201d that the Lenovo have are hilarious. I can\u2019t believe how bad they are. Not only are they very flat and hollow sounding, you can barely hear them at max volume. I even tried using the \u201cAudio EQ\u201d extension, that allows you to boost the preamp and increase volume. Even with that it truly sounds like you have headphones plugged in, sitting on the desk with the volume max. Terrible! Wifi - I have plenty of devices in my home running on a 5Ghz connection with 100+ mb/s internet. Everything works fine...But the Lenovo. Sitting 5\u2019 away from the router shows a \u201cmedium\u201d connection strength. This translated when trying to watch videos and every new video had to \u201cload\u201d for a second, before dropping the quality down for a minute or two while the computer tried catch up. The battery seemed to hold up after a day of \"Using it\". Mainly trying to find if some setting was causing all of the issues and poor quality. The keyboard felt fine. Trackpad was fine. I ended up returning this and buying the Acer Chromebook 14. These two should not be within $300 of each other. If the Lenovo was a $150 chromebook, I could argue that for the price, at least it kind of works. But when they are asking the same price as some of the other brands that are much higher quality, I had to leave a review to warn others. I use a $2500+ Lenovo workstation laptop everyday as an engineer and I have nothing bad to say about it. But this Chromebook is garbage. Don\u2019t buy it.

I use Chrome Remote Desktop to control my work laptop, which is sitting at home, and it's been a great experience. With a good WIFI connection, It feels just like I'm working on the remoted machine. The keyboard feels good, and I'm able to type just fine. I thought I'd be missing having function keys, but there's a system setting to treat the top row of icon keys as if they were F1 - F10, and it works great. If I want to use whatever the icon for that key is supposed to do, I just press the search key (just above the shift key) to use those keys. Apart from needing this for work, most of what I use the computer for is web-related stuff; looking things up, email, watching videos, etc. This works great for that. I'm amazed that a machine for just over $200 can do everything I need to do. The screen is a little washed out, color-wise, but after a couple of days, I don't even notice that any more.

Chromebooks serve a rather specific purpose, and are built at a pretty low price point. They are basically just really low end laptops, so low in spec that they only run well on a web-browser-based operating system. Most have low resolution screens of varying quality. If you need something with full HD 1920x1080 resolution, this Lenovo is one of the very few options. And for the price, this is a great laptop. Yes, the display has a pretty narrow viewing angle. But you shouldn't expect a Retina or MS Surface quality display at this price point. It gets the job done, it is bright and clear (at the right angle) and it has better resolution than anything else at this price. The wifi is a little weak, but again, it does the job. Everything else about it is quite solid. Battery life is superb. The keys have just the right amount of travel and resistance to make typing very comfortable. The touchpad works as it should. It has just enough weight to feel like a real laptop, but without feeling heavy. So again, be realistic in your expectations. Next to a $1300 Surface, this Lenovo comes up way short. But against anything else in the sub $350 market, it is a great buy. At the current Amazon Warehouse price of $200, it is a steal. I bought the refurb/warehouse version.

For creating and editing documents, compatibility issues abounded with the loathsome Word for ios and Google Docs can't come close to the flexibility of creating documents in standard-version Word.  I worried that there is little-to-no storage on Chromebooks, but adding a micro SSD card allows for onboard, sleekly integrated storage, which can supplement cloud storage or an external drive if desired.  Solid feel to keyboard, bright crisp picture, very fast internet and processing speed.

I realize that\u2019s a pretty subjective statement. Screen Not super sharp and not high contrast. I compared it to a very similar screen, but in a top-of-the-line Lenovo model: A Thinkpad T460s, same size and resolution. Text on the T460s is visibly sharper at the same size, and has better blacks and richer colors. I tested this by viewing the same websites and pages. Colors are off from nearly any angle except straight-on, as another viewer mentioned. It\u2019s pretty obvious with a white screen when Night Mode is enabled. The lower half will be blueish but the top half more yellow-ish with the night mode. Speed - I\u2019m on a computer ALL DAY LONG, and so I notice things like the speed to open up a site, and what\u2019s typical. For sure, launching something like YouTube or Gmail takes 50-75% longer than on a 2-generation old laptop (my T460s). It\u2019s also slower than my Macbook Air. Mouse - In my opinion it inherits Linux\u2019s poor mouse support. The one issue: scroll wheel speed. It\u2019s better than desktop Linux, because there\u2019s some acceleration added. But scrolling with the wheel is still too slow to be comfortable for me. Pros: Nice grippy texture Nice full keyboard size Keyboard is pretty decent to type on as well. Good trackpad --- pretty great, in fact. Better than my Thinkpad running Linux. Three-prong A/C adapter cord is better than the typical polarized two-prong, in my opinion. Summary: this is a decent entry-level Chromebook, which would make sense at the $100-$150 price point. But close to $300 doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me because of all the compromises. Also note that it doesn\u2019t have the deluxe Chromebook/laptop features of lit keyboard or touch screen. Those are excellent to have on a device like this that\u2019s mainly used for web access."}, {"name": "Paulie!", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "May 1, 2019", "title": "a lot better options for this price range", "review_text": "I'd only recommend this if you absolutely love Chrome and have to have it on your laptop. For this price range, *in my opinion*, there are much better options. For example, I recently had the opportunity to try Lenevo's Flex 11: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07GM2J244/ . That unit does have Windows (a pro for me) but has so much more to offer: 4 gb ddr4 ram vs the 4gb of lpddr3 here, full 2 in 1 (tablet, tent, and laptop modes) vs standard laptop here, and touch screen vs non touch here, and a cpu that can clock at 2.7gb vs 2.4 max here. So quicker, stronger, and more versatile...and, dare I say, more fun machine all around for a very similar price. So again, unless you're all in on Chrome OS, downloading apps from the Playstore, and have everything hardwired into the Google ecosystem, I can't see why this is your best option. Ranting aside, this unit isn't inherently bad. Its snappy and responsive enough, mirrors my Samsung phone in the android sense, and has plently of port connections (usb-c, sd card, usb, and hdmi). It's very functional and budget friendly. I will say the screen is a bit of a con, however. It's generally too dark and dull. I'd try to test drive in store somewhere or at least a comparable model before choosing this one."}, {"name": "datura2002", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "March 8, 2019", "title": "works okay but has minor drawbacks", "review_text": "I really wanted to love this Lenovo Chromebook S330.  I want to believe that you can get a good Chromebook on a budget, and because I've had previous good experiences with the durability of Lenovo laptops. While the S330 does feel durable, there's a lot of small drawbacks that add up to an uncomfortable experience, especially for users accustomed to a higher-end experience. The size 14-inch display is a good size, but it feels too muted and matte. The colors don't pop and edges of letters etc. are not super sharp because of its low resolution. If you look at it at any angle other than head on, these issues intensify. The build feels solid but also a little cumbersome and heavy compared to slimmer or lighter competitors. On the same note, the keyboard and side buttons feel durable but they also felt too much on the rigid and resistant side, like I had to use just a little too much force to type.  The keyboard doesn't have backlighting. Like all Chromebooks, it was very easy to set up and the Chrome OS naturally avoids bloatware.  It boots super-quickly, but when browsing on the internet, it felt slower than my other regular laptop that was running on the same internet connection. The \"business black\" color is acceptable though not elegant-looking, and the textured surface is easy to clean. Battery life was good, and the trackpad works well.  I like that it has both a USB 3.0 port, USB-C port, an SD slot for storage expansion, and an HDMI out port. Overall, the S330 checks off all the boxes of what a Chromebook needs to do, but it made me itch for more luxurious features and a more elegant design.  It's worth taking on a test drive to see if you feel the same, or are satisfied with what it can deliver."}, {"name": "Bugs", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "March 12, 2019", "title": "Quick charge time & battery life- but the wifi drops constantly", "review_text": "I am new to Chromebooks, but I needed something that I could hold and surf the Internet with and just watch videos, so I thought it might fit the bill.  I really don't mind the screen at all - it's not the best, but it's perfectly fine for me.  I've watched a few videos with it and never thought twice about the video display quality. I don't really like the keyboard.  It requires a lot of use of hotkeys to use the way I use one.  For instance, I am constantly using my pageUP/pageDOWN buttons/End/Home - but it doesn't have those.  Also, often it is hard to right click to copy and paste, so I have to use Control C &V a lot.  I didn't do this review for a while in order to give myself time to get used to the keyboard, and I did, but I still prefer a regular keyboard with more keys.  It feels ok to type on though.  The hardware works just fine. My main problem with this has been the wifi drops all the time.  I have a very fast Internet connection and I'm used to opening at least 5-6 pages at a time.  FORGET THAT.  I can open about 3 pages then the Internet just ups and disconnects.  IN 10 seconds I can open some more.  That's fine when I am reading forums or social media, but it is NOT good for entering sweepstakes if that's a hobby.  It's also hard to order groceries with - For instance, I can put 3 things in my cart, but I have to wait 10 seconds or so to put anything else in it. I have tried disabling all extensions, re syncing everything, checking time, restarting MY ENTIRE NETWORK, changing to Google's DNS servers, changing power options - and nothing works.  I don't have many running apps so I don't think it's lack of memory causing it.  It's just weird.  It's Fast and responsive- dies - fast and responsive- dies.  The wifi will show good strength the entire time, but diagnostics will show a disconnect during it's 'resting phases.'  It gets tired easily I guess.  I would appreciate it if anyone who has a fix for it would share in a comment. I can't recommend it like this, unless you primarily intend to use it to compose on, or to read on - like E-Books.  It is FINE for reading long documents or web pages on. Now, I LOVE the battery life.  It's a light laptop, so it floors me that a 2 hour charge can keep me reading for 3 days!

I'm not super savvy though), unable to download Steam for Linux to attempt other simple games. Google basically thought it was useful to create a machine with a fraction of the capabilities of any phone or tablet and give it a full size keyboard and long battery life.

The outlook app isn\u2019t very compatible to phone/desktop version, it\u2019s kind of clunky.  It\u2019s harder to use. Mousepad works fine, no issues.  There\u2019s no right click. It\u2019s was easy to get used to the keypad, which was similar but not the same as my pc. Yahoo email isn\u2019t that compatible.  Salesforce is different but easy enough to use. Streaming is a bit choppy on action scenes or anything with lots of motion.  With the same wifi I don\u2019t have those issues with the PC laptop and my smart phone. No touch screen is part of what makes it a bit clunkier for the apps. It all depends on what your need is or not if this will work for you or not.  One way to think about a Chromebook is as an overgrown smart phone with a real keyboard and a bigger screen. I found I\u2019ve been using it more and more, almost every day."}, {"name": "V.

I also have an Asus ROG GL702VI that I used to use but it is a little heavy and bulky to pack and transport everyday (absolutely great gaming laptop if you're looking for one). This Lenovo Chromebook though is very convenient to carry and lasts all day. The FHD screen makes creating presentations and related activities easy since its easier to tell if something looks wrong. The chassis is much firmer feeling than other Chromebooks I've used. Some other ones I've tried feel cheaply built and feel like they will break if I breathe on them too hard. The only real complaint I have is with the amount of USB ports. You get one USB type-c and one \"regular\" USB port. Now for most people this may not be an issue, but in my college career it has caused a number of inconveniences in transferring data and the like, I work as a GRA so the data that I have to work with is different than what most students would be working with since I have to go out and gather it in some cases from many people. I would really like to give this five stars but the USB issues push it out of the five star range for me; HOWEVER, if all you're going to do is browse the web, make google docs, and maybe the occasional spreadsheet I would say that it is definitely a five star product."}, {"name": "RG", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "August 9, 2019", "title": "Solid \"value\" Chromebook", "review_text": "Considering the price, it's really quite a good deal.  I wouldn't use it as my primary computer for heavy duty tasks or if I needed to multi-task.  But it works well as a secondary laptop.  I use it primarily for web browsing.  It seems to perform just fine when i watch YouTube or Amazon Prime videos.  I can keep multiple tabs open in the browser and it doesn't lag at all.  It boots up super fast and the battery life is quite good (roughly 7-10 hours, didn't really time it precisely).  The screen quality is not great but it's pretty good considering the cost. The biggest drawback of course is that you're tightly integrated with Google's ecosystem.  As a longtime Windows user, I find that to be rather limiting, which is why I still have a Window laptop as my primary computer.  There are too many things you can't do on a Chromebook, or can only do in a much more limited fashion.  But for many everyday tasks like web-surfing or online shopping it's perfectly capable.  It's big enough to not feel like the screen is cramped but also small and light enough to throw into a bag and not feel bulky or heavy."}, {"name": "Sloff", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "February 13, 2019", "title": "Its a computer i guess?", "review_text": "If you want a sub par computer experience, here you go.

It did not give me the opportunity to establish a user name or password. It did not take me through the familiar Windows 10 first steps at all (select time zone, etc.).

I feel misled and cheated by the seller. I next used the HP software included in the computer to install (reinstall) Windows 10.

After winning your prize, you went home and realized that it was still not a good deal.  This laptop is almost in that category, though the build quality keeps it above water. It is important to start by discussing Windows 10 S.  It is a very restricted version of Windows 10 that allows only official apps to be installed, like the Edge web browser and Microsoft Office, plus restricts some multitasking.  There are different reasons for it to exist, including corporate/business use, to prevent unauthorized apps and avoid viruses.  It is also reportedly aimed at low end devices, being a lightweight version of the operating system more in line with a Chromebook.  This was my first experience with it, so I went in with an open mind... Everything seemed laggy and slow.  Isn't Windows 10 S supposed to be fast?  Sometimes a new computer is downloading and installing updates in the background, which makes it feel slow.  I checked and the computer was up to date.  The internet on my home Wifi, which works fine for everything else, was spotty.  The web browser would sometimes work slowly and other times not at all.  I quickly realized, also, that nearly everything I do on a computer is not accessible in Windows 10 S.  I browse the web in the Brave browser, which I couldn't install.  I watch movies in VLC.  So, I decided to \"upgrade\" to standard Windows 10 home, which is free, but the page for that kept stalling out. After giving the laptop a day off and taking it to work to try a different network on the older band (802.11g), Windows successfully switched off of S mode.  Annoyingly, I was required to use a Microsoft account to do that.  I checked and suddenly there were a ton of updates that I could install.  After doing so, the laptop was 500% faster, even if it was still on the slower side.  It also worked fine on my home network.  Do not believe the warnings that pop up about it slowing the computer down to switch.  I also went into power settings and turned off GPU throttling, which is a trick hardware makers play to give better battery life estimates at the cost of performance.  After downloading my preferred browser and software, I was able to browse the web and stream video fine.  I tried using the HDMI port, but it would not allow me to use the monitor.  Some glitch seems to happen, which may be related to the monitor having HDR support.  Normally, a computer that does not support HDR will just output non-HDR and it will work fine, but something strange was happening with the settings vanishing.  When that failed after a lot of tinkering, I tried Miracast (wireless display casting) and that actually worked with just a little lag, but it cuts out after maybe 20 minutes each time. The screen is very outdated.  Apart from the lower resolution, which I can live with, the viewing angles require very direct aiming of the screen at the viewer.  If I try to look at the screen when I am standing up, it looks all washed out.  Coming out in 2019, this is not acceptable on even a cheap laptop. Overall build quality, for the low price, is not bad at all.  It has a business laptop look that is not offensive and is more sturdy than some in this price range.  The charger is the traditional block type rather than the handy USB-C.  There are no USB-C ports at all. As many faults as this laptop has, it could be worth purchasing at a very low price, rather than the current pretty low price.  If you just need some light browsing (not on a monitor or a good screen) and can deal with the headaches of the OS, I could see it having merit."}, {"name": "Angela J Brouse", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "November 22, 2019", "title": "FAILURE", "review_text": "ORDERED THIS ITEM 10NOV2019  ARRIVED NEXT DAY SET IT UP SHORTLY AFTER ...

I wanted a no-frills, cheapish machine that would be able to run Microsoft Word, a few tabs in a browser, and some very light programming and CAD work. This laptop is able to do so, but only by the skin of its teeth.  It must be noted that it comes with Windows S, a locked operating system somewhat reminiscent of Chrome OS, where non-certified apps are restricted, and the laptop's performance is thus protected from strain.  The moment I had the laptop set up, I reverted it to normal Windows 10 Home and that is when the seams started to show. From startup to shut down, no matter what I am asking of the CPU, the Intel Celeron N4000 remains at 100% load.  It is chugging\u2026one hundred percent of the time.  RAM usage sits at around 80%, regardless of task or program in use.  There are noticeable delays when trying to open programs or browser tabs, forget CAD work.  This may be partially my fault, since the laptop is designed for a Windows S environment, but an outdated CPU tied to 4 GB of RAM will always struggle, regardless of the environment.  HP may have tried to alleviate this by giving the laptop a very low-quality screen, where even normal text is often slightly pixelated. The 64 eMMC storage is fine\u2026if you are using some cloud service for the majority of your storage (the laptop comes with one year of 1 TB of OneDrive storage).  Don\u2019t expect to store movies or install many programs on this laptop. A mark in this laptop's favor is the three USB-A ports, one of which is USB 2.0 and the other two of which are 3.1 Gen 1.  It also has a full-sized HDMI port, which I have already used many times in the office.  It has no USB-C port, unlike most modern laptops, but, somewhat hilariously, neither does a single projector or TV in my office.  For better or for worse, they all still have HDMI cords and I have been asked many times to use my underpowered laptop over co-workers modern workhorses simply because of that HDMI port! I don\u2019t mind this laptop, with its huge bezels, bad camera, and outdated Wi-Fi antenna.  I have had to drastically change my expectations, but I never worry about it getting beat up on my commute or damaged when I drop my backpack to the ground. It does what I ask of it, barely, and that is just fine.  Oh, and it will be the laptop I take with me on my next overseas project.  If it gets destroyed or lost... I won't cry too hard."}, {"name": "Kathleen", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "September 15, 2019", "title": "Excellent Entry level Laptop", "review_text": "First of all, I LOVE HP products and have stuck with them over the past 10 years, as I\u2019ve had many of the other big brands which have seriously disappointed.

For the price it was adequate, but looked childish and was housed in aqua blue plastic.

The hardware aspect of the laptop is good and it's comfortable to use.  Frankly I think it reflects well on HP!  But my big issue with this machine is the operating system that comes with it.  Windows 10 S is TERRIBLE.  This laptop arrived just before I went on a trip and I wasn't able to bring it along because it required an active internet connection to set it up.  (I didn't know if the hotel would have wifi)  That is just infuriating, you should NEVER require an internet connection just to start a device like this.  Seriously, you HAVE TO REGISTER AN ACCOUNT WITH MICROSOFT JUST TO LOG IN TO THIS THING. Another issue I have with this operating system is that I use Chrome.  I mean I really use Chrome as in I log in to it and it manages my bookmarks.  A machine like this is not likely to be the primary machine, so picking a browser like Chrome makes sense, all the syncing etc is automatic.  I went to go get Chrome and Windows 10 S was like \"NOPE.  You can use Edge, though!\" Seriously, it reminded me of that time AT&T told me I can avoid a data-overage if I just don't use the service.  If that's not frustrating enough, I used Edge to log into Gmail where I was met with lotsa \"you should download Chrome!\"... meaning even the sites I visit aren't aware I'm on a different OS than Windows 10 and... just yuck yuck yuck.  I got this machine to replace a Chromebook and frankly I regret it.  I thought it would be more versatile but the limitations they put on what can be run is, for me, insurmountable.  I can use it, but I'm having to compromise a good deal more than I had expected to.  I mean, the specs suggest it'll be slow,  and that's okay!  I just didn't expect it to flat out deny software installations. One would expect that a Chromebook would have more limitations than this machine, after owning one for a while I'm not inclined to agree, however your mileage may vary. I hate giving this machine a bad review because I think HP did a very nice job with it's design and construction.  None of my criticisms at ALL are due to any shortcomings HP has.  My complaints are 100% about Microsoft.  Seriously, if I could put Windows 7 on this machine it'd be FAR better!!! I would advise steering in the direction of a Chromebook over this machine.  I mean unless you know that Windows 10 S will be fine for your web usage (like.. if you use Edge already) this machine will be quite satisfactory to you.  But if you've never heard of Windows 10 S before there's a very good chance you'd be happier if just kept looking"}, {"name": "Moises Garcia Landeros", "rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "October 17, 2019", "title": "Designed with their heads in the clouds.", "review_text": "The good: comes with access to office for a year.

I don't need for it to be a gaming machine, or to replace my regular computer. What I want it for is to take with me on travels, because it doesn't weigh a fraction of the MacBook Pro, and is way more functional than the iPad. When I'm lying in bed, it's nice to pull up a comic or a book or a YouTube video on the iPad. When I'm at home, and I have a desk, the MacBook is comfortable and easy to use. However, when I travel, I don't want to take either one with me. The MacBook is too heavy, and the iPad is extremely limited in scope to what it can do. This little guy lets me connect a drive to the USB port, and watch my movies. I have a full sized keyboard to chat with my friends when I watch a Twitch stream. I can remote into my office machine reasonably well. The battery lasts a good long time. If I'm just watching movies or something, I'll turn off the WiFi, and let the movies roll. Otherwise, even with the WiFi and Bluetooth turned on, I can get some good long battery life out of this guy. One more benefit: the power cable plugs into the right side of the machine. I'm left handed, and this is very nice to have. The volume of the speakers is plenty loud for me to listen to audio at home. The screen resolution is nice, and it shows up a Netflix stream with no trouble at all, and nice crisp resolution. Again, I don't have a ton of software installed. I threw on VLC player to play my movies, and the Chrome browser for web browsing. Aside from that, I keep things pretty dumbed down. In fact, I went through and /removed/ a bunch of the software that came pre-installed. That's the one gripe I had. Unlike my Mac, this machine came with a bunch of garbage that I'll never use. I don't need an antivirus, because I'm using Windows Defender and not going onto dodgy websites. I don't need a trial version of other random stuff either, because whatever software I need, I already own, and I don't expect this one to try and replace that. It's my one and only gripe, that it took me a /while/ to set this up to my liking, because I had to remove so much garbage, and turn off so many things that auto start with the machine."}, {"name": "BeachBrights", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "September 25, 2019", "title": "4-star", "review_text": "This laptop is made to be a small, lightweight portable, \u201ccloud\u201d computer.

I was looking for a laptop that I can use for work, travels easy, but can afford me some game time when I am on the road.  Budget wasn\u2019t really an issue, but I wanted to make sure I was getting the most value for what I spent.  I do not do intensive work applications on it just email, excel, general surfing etc.  I am not a competitive gamer, so getting that extra millisecond of response time was not a concern but I wanted something that could handle current games and most games that will come out over the next couple of years. What I considered / compared it too? GPU \u2013 GTX 1650 \u2013 this thing rocks, most comparisons were to the older (but still capable) 1050i and other variations.  I wanted the newest I could get for the cost.  So this was the bench mark of my search. Processor \u2013 9th gen i5 \u2013 I really wanted to get a 9th gen i7 but, most of the ones that had it only had the 1050 series of graphics card, and as I stated above that\u2019s what I really valued most. NOTE: Lenovo DOES make a version of this with a gen 9 i7, it is not available (at the time of writing this) on Amazon. It IS available on Lenovo\u2019s website for about $180 more than this unit (on sale for $270 off ATM), but it comes with a smaller SSD.  I know its easier to replace an SSD than a GPU (basically impossible on a laptop like this) but between the cost difference and not having to hassle with adding an SSD right when I received it, that\u2019s why I decided against that route. NOTE: the benchmark testing on a gen 9 i5 vs i7 were very close in most tests, while future proofing your purchase is a good idea, it didn\u2019t look like a big enough difference (4 cores 8 threads on the 5 vs 6 cores 12 threads on the 7) to move me to spend more. NOTE: This laptop model might be an Amazon exclusive because I could not locate it on the Lenovo web site. Monitor refresh \u2013 60Hz \u2013 this was a tough one for me, there are some laptops that have the 9th gen i7, 16gb ram and the 1650 graphics card with 144Hz monitor (and there is a difference, just watch some youtube videos on it) but that cost difference was about $450.  For the games I play (will get to that in a second), the look, and the weight of the product, I just couldn\u2019t pull the trigger on the extra costs. RAM \u2013 8GB \u2013 documents state that you can upgrade the single 8GB stick to 16GB. 16GB DDR4 is about 70 bucks, if I get into a game that is giving me performance issues, I am ok with that upgrade cost. NOTE: Lenovo says you should use an authorized tech to upgrade your RAM/SSD or you might void the warranty.  I am not sure of the legality of that due to the right to self-repair, but I have done enough that it doesn\u2019t concern me, your views/value my differ from mine in this respect. 512gig SSD \u2013 I definitely wanted an SSD, boot speeds etc are totally worth it. 512 means I can fit about 6+ of today\u2019s modern games on it comfortably.  I am ok with that for now.  It does have an extra 2.5\u201d bay for another SSD (I have a 1TB from my old laptop so if I get to the point where I need it, it won\u2019t cost me anything extra, obviously your experience will differ from mine in that additional cost).  The extra bay is nice because you do not have to reload the OS etc, you can add the drive and increase your storage easily.  The NOTE above on the RAM upgrade applies here too. The Look \u2013 As I mentioned I will be using this for work too, this is as discrete of a \u201cgaming\u201d laptop as I have seen.  I did not want flashy lights or gaming brand logos on the cover.  I have the power to game; I don\u2019t need or want to flaunt it in my day job interacting with customers. Keyboard backlight \u2013 has 3 settings, off, low, high.  I play in a pretty dark room and the low setting was perfect to let me see while not blinding my peripheral vision. Heat \u2013 this is not a loud laptop (fans); I have been gaming on laptops for 10 years an have had my fair share of jet engines.  This doesn\u2019t appear to be one of those.  It does get warm, but nothing of concern or that would burn to the touch. Battery life \u2013 I haven\u2019t tested it yet completely (will update when I do) but in \u201ceconomy\u201d mode (not using the 1650 graphics card) it looks to last 5+ hours, the description says 9 hours but I doubt that, still its more than enough for when I can\u2019t plug in.  Running with the 1650 turned on and gaming I would get around 2 hours. Bloat \u2013 amazingly it didn\u2019t come with much on it that I had to remove.  MacAfee and a Lenovo thing, that\u2019s about it. What games do I play on it? No Man\u2019s Sky Beyond \u2013 Played on high settings with no issues/lag/clipping at all WoW \u2013 Ultra settings with no issues (obviously its an older games graphics wise) Overwatch \u2013 Ultra Settings with no issues As I play and test more games ill update this\u2026.. 9/29/19 EDIT - Borderlands 3 - 30 FPS on Ultra, dialed back to medium and was more than great for my average gamer needs. 11/30/19 EDIT - Thrown a ton of games at this over the past few months.  Basically anything made before 2018 you can run at max with no issues.  Most newer games (2019 releases) will run just fine at med/high settings. What about the backlight/bleeding reports? Ill knock on wood, I have not seen bleeding on the edges for darker games, or I might just not be noticing it.  backlight/monitor darkness, again, I have not experienced this, and I hope I don\u2019t.

In addition to this, the laptop I received has an issue with the backlight showing through the top of the screen which is very unappealing.

The i5-9300h will pretty much be able to do anything except for the heaviest tasks, while the GTX 1650 can handle a large variety of games, though the most graphics intense games will need medium to low settings. While there are only 8 GB of RAM, in my usage (internet browsing, college work, occasional gaming) that has never been a problem. Again, this isn't the absolute most powerful laptop, but it is probably far above average in performance. Battery life is surprisingly good for a gaming laptop, especially if you undervolt (which I did by -125 mV if you're interested), and it runs relatively cool as well, rarely going over 80 C. I personally really like the minimalist design, with blue accents instead of the \"gamer\" red, so this won't turn too many heads in a professional meeting. The screen bezels are relatively small too, and while apparently the color gamut is not the best, that either doesn't matter or isn't even apparent to me (in case you saw reviews criticizing this). Maybe if you're in graphic design, this might matter, though. The hinge is strong, and can bend all the way to 180 degrees. It's not a touchscreen laptop, but there are some uses, such as watching a video in bed or something. The system is also really slim for a gaming laptop, and easy to carry around, which is an excellent design choice. The build quality isn't the best, being mostly plastic, but it is still smooth to feel, so there is at least that. The keyboard isn't very clicky, and the travel distance is a little small. It takes a while to get used to, but eventually you may get used to it. The backlit keyboard is nice, though. The trackpad unfortunately uses garbage Synaptics drivers. I played around with the registry a bit to add a couple gestures, but coming from Windows Precision, the trackpad is definitely a massive downgrade from Precision for me. I tried installing Precision drivers, and they worked (excellently, I might add) temporarily, because I guess Windows update has something in place to really latch you on to Synaptics drivers. Although there are definitely some sacrifices made (including some that I haven't mentioned, such as needing to buy a separate cable if you want to add a hard drive or having only one slot for RAM), I think that on balance this laptop provides fantastic value for $680. In some areas you get what you pay for, but for $680 this laptop can do a lot more than others."}, {"name": "Brian", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "October 12, 2019", "title": "Didn't buy it for gaming but...", "review_text": "I wanted a lightning fast laptop.

The large amount of RAM and relatively powerful mobile processor allow me to run multiple docker instances or virtual machines without slowing down my work. Given the specs, the battery life is expectedly low - but honestly fairly decent for what you get. If you're not doing anything intensive it can easily last 3-4 hours. Linux compatibility is great as well - The hardware is all supported by current open source drivers as well - save for the dual head mode on the GPU, you will need to install the proprietary nvidia-driver-430 or newer if you'd like to use a secondary display along with the built in panel. My only major complaint is that the USB-C connection does NOT support HDMI over USB. It's only a Gen 1 USB 3.1 controller and outputs just 5Gbit/s - far short of what's needed to drive a monitor or two. The built-in HDMI connection works just fine, but I'd have preferred the ability to use an all-in-one dock so it's a bit disappointing for a newer generation laptop to have such an old USB controller.

Nvidia 1650 graphics card and 8GB of RAM make for fast processing. Was able to simultaneously download 2 50GB games while watching Netflix. Was then able to play those games at 45-60FPS on high settings with no lag (Overwatch and Battlefield V). 2) Elegant. Design is discreet and simple; good for the professional adult who loves to game. No need to embarrass yourself by lugging around a machine that throws up green and red lights with its brand and logo plastered on the chassis. This is a laptop you wouldn\u2019t mind taking into the meeting room. 3) Privacy Shutter. A simple design add-in, but an appreciated one nonetheless. It is a physical piece of plastic that slides shut over your webcam, so no gimmicks there. 4) Connectivity. Offers an ethernet port, HDMI port, 2 USB ports, headphone jack, and USB-C. More than enough for my needs. If you need more, you can easily get adapters. 5) Matte screen. By this I mean that the screen is not glossy or prone to glares like OLED or LCD screens are. It\u2019s much softer on the eyes, and your screen won\u2019t be blocked out by the sun or if you are next to a light source. Cons: 1) Storage. This only offers 500gb, which is very small compared to the standard of 1TB that most laptops offer now. However, this is easily fixed with an external hard drive that can be bought from $20-$45. 2) Matte Screen. I realize that I listed this in my pros; that is because due to its anti-glare properties, the colors have suffered a bit when compared to OLED or LCD screens. However, the amount of color diminishment is very low; I\u2019d say this would matter much only if you are a serious content creator. Otherwise, it makes no difference to the average PC user. 3) Mousepad sensitivity. It is low compared to other laptops, such as the Microsoft Surface Pro or the MacBook Series, so that may throw some users off. This is easily fixed by downloading a free program called Windows Precision Tracker. Otherwise, a wireless mouse is just fine. Conclusion: Overall, this is a very attractive laptop that certainly delivers on its power and speed. It is perfectly balanced between being a work and gaming laptop.

You will get distortion looking straight on. The monitor was poorly calibrated with WAY too much gamma, luckily adjusting this with Windows is trivial, I will get back to 'S Mode' later on. You will not be able to use this monitor for watching movies with a lot of dark scenes. If you are looking at the screen dead on the outer regions of black will be distorted to LIGHT grey. The keyboard is decent, the 10-key is a bit difficult with the keys not being the right size on the side. The button press is tactile and usable and the feel is fine enough for typing blind, which you shouldn't have to do since the keyboard is back-lit. The touch pad is okay, it's actually a bit too sensitive, the lower corners can be used as buttons but I would greatly prefer physical buttons like on the current Lenovo brand laptops. The touch pad has a fingerprint reader in the top right corner which interferes with the operation of the touch pad but at least the fingerprint reader is fast! The speakers are complete garbage, they have no semblance to actual sounds and it sounds like you are listening to a cellphone speaker through a wooden door. They are completely unusable for anything at all, do not buy this laptop if you enjoy playing anything on your speakers. The webcam is usable, but it's nothing to write home about, capping out at 720p/30fps it will feel like a power-point presentation more than a video feed on any video chat. The sound is about the same as phone quality. If you do video chats frequently, find another laptop. Back to windows and 'S Mode'. Windows is pre-installed, it had some of the latest updates already so it was recently installed. It doesn't have much bloatware, but having Skype installed is too much already. The \"type\" of Windows that is installed is called 'S Mode' which is basically a locked down completely restrictive version of Windows. You can't even download Chrome from the web you have to get it from the Microsoft store - Chrome being the first app I install on any Windows computer -. I removed 'S Mode' almost immediately. The laptop has 4Gb of non-removable memory and 4Gb of replaceable memory which is nice even though it's only single channel. The laptop is made from a plastic frame which I actually don't mind, it makes the laptop reasonably light, but it gives it a cheap experience. Opening the lid for example requires two hands or a technique, both of which is actually mildly inconvenient. Summary: The good: Decent keyboard and touch pad, fast loading web pages If you like a want a PC for viewing Netflix/media at home with no headphones, look somewhere else. If you want a PC for viewing Wikipedia/news then this will be decent but there are cheaper laptops that can do that better. If you have a fancy IPS monitor, you will hate this laptop. If you are even thinking about gaming, the answer is no. Seeing as this laptop has such limited uses with the horrible screen and speakers, I cannot give this laptop a better review that 3 stars. It's only purpose is to view webpages and basic coffee-shop work."}, {"name": "Barny", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "July 21, 2019", "title": "Overall good for the money", "review_text": "The SSD and RAM  are upgradeable but it does not have any empty slots for anything.

I did buy a 1x8GB kit of ddr4 sodimm 2400mhz cl16 ram to upgrade the memory on the laptop from the original 8GB, and I made a quick discovery that the laptop comes with 4GB of RAM soldered onto the motherboard, thus you can only replace the other stick of RAM in the populated RAM slot that has a 4GB stick in it. So I now have 12GB of RAM on my f512d ryzen model. Furthermore, the SSD that came included with my model used a Kingston 256GB SSD, leaving one open slot for a 2.5 inch Sata SSD or HDD. The battery life lasts about 2-3 hours on a near-full charge, and since my college classes require atleast a 1.5 hours of charge per class, I could dim down the display for less battery usage and possibly the keyboard backlights, but I'd say it's a win either way. Overall, the screen is IPS and beautiful, the entire system  feels snappy and responsive, and I can actually run 3D applications on it without it bugging out like my last Samsung i3 laptop from 2013. Love AMD's new product lineup and I hope this helps anyone else looking to buy this laptop. UPDATE: Sadly, my unit didn't last long. I just began using my 3-d softwares and new code IDE's for C++ and this thing blue-screened every 5 minutes or so. Sometimes I was lucky and it'd work nicely but just today, the drive slowed down to a near halt and as windows tried to repair or reset it, it just died. I now boot into the bios everytime with no storage or boot-detection of the ssd. What a brilliant time for it to die. Also for battery life, turning off the keyboard backlighting litterally gave me 9+ hours of battery-life.

It has 2 slots, 1 installed with 8 GB of RAM and 1 slot left open for an additional 8 GB.\" Mine did not. Looking at the ASUS website, the specs  says \"4 GB DDR4 2400MHz SDRAM Onboard memory, 1 x SO-DIMM socket for expansion, up to 12 GB SDRAM\".

(I also presently own and use an ASUS brand, model F556U.) Granted, none of these have been top of the line models, except for a jumbo-sized Dell laptop that was excellent but way too large and heavy to use comfortably anywhere but on a desk.  The rest have been a mix of Apple, and Windows-based machines that get used on a daily or regular basis, primarily for internet stuff, streaming music, and looking up formulas/pricing on installed software.  In other words, my usage is constant but not technically demanding. On that basis, I rate this computer FIVE STARS.  Here is what I like about the machine: 1) Fast and reliable boot up from either a cold start or waking up from sleep; 2) Excellent and fast wifi AND Bluetooth connectivity; 3) Clarity and vividness of screen; 4) Suprisingly good speaker function; 5) Beautiful finger feel of keyboard both from an ergonomic and functionality standpoint; 6) Overall look and feel. The ASUS I had been using on a daily basis was cursed with an irritating and fidgety touchpad that made it a chore to use with accuracy, and was a commented upon flaw with the model.  It also took forever to boot up, especially from sleep and often lost wifi reception when it would mysteriously switch to airplane mode or turn off wifi, sometimes more than once in a session.  It is also had poor sound reproduction.  I would have rated it 3 stars. As to this computer, it looks great, it works great, it sounds good, and it feels great to operate and type on.  There is nothing I can think of to criticize it.  It just works GREAT! One thing I do miss is a CD drive, which my old ASUS has, but I realize that new laptops are all web-based and don't typically come with them.  Really, apart from that I have nothing but praise for this computer which, like its title is both Thin and Light, yet has a huge screen and is very fast and reliable.  In sum it is a pleasure to use. I can't comment upon battery life because I rarely ever have no access to an electrical outlet when using any computer.  If I do begin to use this unplugged I will update this review. I recommend this machine."}, {"name": "D.

I like the full windows experience. It has a backlight keyboard with dark rooms. The charging speed is pretty quick as well. It has multiple ports including USB C. No disc drive which is a trend in most computers of today. For the price I paid this is a great unit. It was in my price range. So it's the perfect fit.

I've had this computer for a couple of weeks; it performs very modestly better than the model I bought in 2015.  The display is slightly better.  The computer seems \"military build quality\", but has an annoyingly designed (mini-USB?) power plug that tends to fall out of the computer (leaving the user with minimal juice for the next use); can't imagine the computer could be used with the power plug in place -- it would fall out constantly.  Network connectivity still seems seems balky.

I am using it mainly for my school work, I do full time classes at university and some are online. I needed something light and fast that I could travel with. If you are looking for something that is a powerhouse laptop at this price point you are fooling yourself. I am surprised I got this good of a deal on a laptop with a SSD in it. I bought this laptop with the mindset that I wanted something that was fast and could do a light work load because I have a powerhouse gaming Desktop PC at home, so I did not need something over the top in a laptop. I also wanted it to be light for travel. If you are looking for something that will run High FPS Games or Adobe products smoothly I 100% don't recommend this PC. This computer can handle simple games, I like to play My Time at Portia and it can run League of Legends, but most potatoes can, so it's not a gaming PC by any means, but you need to check the Games themselves and see the lowest setting you can run them on (Like you should if you are a gamer and wanting a new laptop). The size of the SSD is not the greatest, so if you do not use things like Google doc's that save to the cloud you will be wanting to get an external drive or an SD card. I believe you can install a HDD on here, but am unsure and do not plan to myself. I have a 1TB external drive for if I need to move files between computers and as a general rule of just having my files backed up to several places. Pros: - Boots up in seconds - Runs smooth for everyday light use, Internet Browsing, Watching Youtube, Hulu, Netflix - Plays some games that don't need high graphics cards or processors - SD card slot so I can extend storage if need be - Has an Ethernet Port and a HDMI port if you travel and want to put something on the bad hotel TV's Cons: - The Bloatware, so dumb and useless - No others right now Again my review is based on this product at this price point. I didn't expect this PC to run a graphics intensive Game, I would never expect a 400$ laptop to do so. I love that it came with an SSD, the storage is fine for my needs as I mainly use Google Docs for school and have an external drive. I have had no issues with the Wi-fi on the laptop as of yet, I do not expect to. If you are looking for a laptop that will offer you speed and be a great travel companion if you are in college or travel for work, you should get this one. Last thing I do recommend installing a fresh version of Windows 10 so you don't get the bloatware, or you can just uninstall the bloatware through Programs and Features.

This old, over-used standard is a foolish corner-cut by HP.  Even $100 android tablets now include 5 GHZ, 802.11ac WIFI.  With the older technology you are poorly equipped to fight for bandwidth in the increasingly congested WIFI environment.  In my neighborhood I got single digit MHz downloads with the CF0014DX:  OK for most web surfing, lousy for video streaming.  With an 802.11ac adapter I get 150 MHz to 200 MHz downloads \u2013 an astonishing improvement. The good news if you already own a laptop with 2.4 Ghz WIFI is you can easily upgrade with a USB WIFI dongle costing less than $15.  There are many options, I recently had success with this one:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07LFXN1SJ/ The CF0014DX computer only has two USB ports.  Having to buy a WIFI dongle for a new computer and fill up a precious USB port is unacceptable. The other impractical aspect of this package is that the SSD is only 128 GB.  It may seem passable for you today, but 256 GB is a realistic longer term minimum for most. I bought a better version of this computer for just $70 more: model  HP 14-cf0051od with 256 GB SSD.  Some listings show it having the older WIFI standard, but it certainly has an 802.11ac network adapter.  The processor is noticeably much faster; it will seem fast for several years longer than the CF0014DX. I see the Lenovo IdeaPad 530S 14\u201d, similar in specs to my HP 14-cf0051od,  on sale at big box for lower price.  It has advantage over the two HPs of higher res graphics and ability to upgrade RAM.  But no buyer\u2019s remorse here, I have long history with HP computers and am thrilled with my cf0051od. Buying a refurbished HP Elitebook or Dell Latitude on Amazon would also be a better value than the CF0014DX.  I am a big fan of buying refurbished desktop computers (sans monitor) because they can be upgraded easily.  I\u2019m shyer about refurbished laptops because they are more delicate; you can\u2019t just swap in new keyboard, mouse or monitor; many things can be wrong with them.  Take a risk on a refurbished laptop if you are fine with evaluating and potentially returning."}, {"name": "J. Meza", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "February 2, 2019", "title": "High value laptop", "review_text": "I'm really only using this laptop for three things -Internet browsing -word processing via (google docs) -emails *possibly light gaming such as hearthstone or solitaire/suduko For it's three main uses it functions very well. I mainly use this laptop for school. The 8gb of ram are plenty for my needs and the hard is ok which I'll get into. Connections -2 usb ports (one of them is a 2.0 and one of them is 3.0) however when you at the side of the laptop you cant tell which one is which cause they both look the same and the small guide that come with the laptop does not show you which is which, but that's ok for me. -1 headphone/mic combo jack -1 HDMI port (this is particularly good if you plan to mirror you screen to a television) -1 ethernet connection (RJ-45) this is the basic ethernet connector most people use -1 power adaptor port -1 usb C port -1 card reader (which I haven't used yet) -1 connector to hook up a locking cable for you laptop (I probably will never use this but cool feature anyways) After opening the box -I like that it is a very light weight laptop which is great for traveling and school -the keyboard feels fantastic (much better than my previous lenovo) -the track pad works well and if you look at one of my photos it has some special features that allow you to zoom in on the screen and use in a way similar to a smart phone (these features also apply to the touch screen version of this laptop but the laptop I am reviewing is not a touch screen) I personally prefer a laptop with out the touch screen feature -The description says that the hard drive is a 128 GB SSD. It is indeed a SSD but they maximum capacity is 118 GB and after OS installation, windows updates, and some basic apps, the storage left over is about 80 GB. This is ok for me. When you think about it 80 GB is still a lot of storage space, and I have a 1TB external hard drive that im using to store most of my files. Also If you prefer there are many ways to get free cloud storage such as dropbox or google drive. If you plan to store large videos and/or massive amounts of photos I would recommend getting and external hard drive. (keep in mind this laptop does have a card reader so you could also get yourself a some kind of sd card for storage space as well) Also this laptop comes in a 256 GB storage capacity, I'm guessing after the formalities it's closer to 225 GB. -The screen looks good. Its clear and bright (adjustable). great definition -The sound is ok. It really the same as you would expect for any laptop. I will be using my song headphone if I feel like getting better sound -There is a little fan that runs, but you will hardly notice it. -The laptop top does come with some bloat ware but you can sort that for your self or just keep. ( you might not even notice the difference) -The cold start time is about 8 seconds (that's really fast!) Things to Note -Don't buy the expert setup. Save yourself the 80 dollars and buy some accessories. The setup is simple and the laptop will walk you through the process (nothing major to do). All I did was plug in the laptop to an outlet, turned it on, and cortana walks you through the process. It only take about five minutes. Add another five minutes to run windows update and download/install the newest updates. It really is easy. -This laptop does not have a CD drive. It says so in the description on amazon. I'm just pointing it out for those who skipped straight to the review section. -If gaming is your biggest concern I would not suggest this laptop. It does have a decent processor and amount of ram, but it's more for general use and apps that consume less of your cpu power. -Amazon offers a warranty. You can get it if you want; that part is really up to you, and depends on how much abuse you think you might put your laptop through. If you're on the fence about the warranty, HP themselves offer a warranty that you can purchase after the fact when you setup the laptop for the first time. I believe it cost 80 dollars for three years. In conclusion If you feel like you identify with the student/worker/average person who needs a laptop for travel and general use, you can purchase this laptop knowing it will perform well for you. HP is a great brand and makes reliable computers. I would highly recommend this laptop for anyone who plans to use it for school."}, {"name": "Patrick Dalbec", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "January 2, 2019", "title": "Great Laptop for Price - first impression", "review_text": "I bought this laptop knowing it wouldn't be a powerhouse.

If you are looking for a \"Chromebook\", this machine is a little deceiving at first.  It comes with Microsoft Windows 10 operating system in \"S\" mode.  If you want to keep it in \"S mode\" that's fine; however, I think that \"S mode\" simply makes it impossible to utilize Google and other apps on a device that has the capability to do more.  I turned it off on day two and I have been happy with my machine.  If you aren't willing to fart with Microsoft monopoly \"s mode\" crap, I would recommend buying a Chrome book for about $100 more.  I think this is a good machine with a lot of potential, but I also think \"S mode\" is stupid.  It isn't safety and security that they are marketing with \"S-mode\", it's creating division and preventing free market apps unless you turn it off or elect to change operating systems.

Immediately upon opening the shipping box I noticed that it was labeled on the physical laptop that it ran windows 10 in S mode. What this means is that any function, download, or App that is not curated from the Microsoft Store will not run in the computer. One can turn off S mode pretty easily but it negatively impacts the speed and performance of the laptop. The specs that the laptop advertises are generated when using S mode, so when turning off S mode, the qualifications the laptop sold you on, can be incorrect. I do not want this feature, and my problem is that this feature was not displayed accurately or, well, even at all on this store page. Had it been mentioned and accurately advertised that this computer ran in S mode, I would not have purchased it. That by itself wouldn't have warranted a review, but this laptop at the time of me writing this, is less than 24 hours old and I'm being notified during the boot sequence that a broken fan (90B) is being detected and continued use of the laptop will result in possible system failure (it will break the system). The fact that this laptop shipped broken, with an obvious fan issue, pushes me to attempt to get a refund. I didn't want to spend time on this, I have enough already in my day but I can't waste money on faulty products and can't spend more to fix something that should have been 100% functional when it was shipped to me.

Hughes", "rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "December 6, 2017", "title": "Solid Chromebook, but far from \"Premium\"", "review_text": "I have to start off by saying that I'm a Chromebook fan. I've tested several and owned a few. There are still apps (when I was growing up, we called them \"programs\" and \"software\") that will only run on a PC, but I try when possible to take a Chromebook with me wherever I go because they are just so damn handy. Why is this important? Because this review is not here to hate on Chromebooks. They are great little machines. Many reviews hate the OS, and don't focus on the hardware when writing their reviews. Unfortunately, this 2017 Acer Flagship CB3-532 15.6\" HD \"Premium Chromebook\" is not really \"premium.\" For two Benjamins, it's still a better computer than NASA had for all the Apollo missions-- in the space crafts and on the ground combined. But I was expecting more. I have a 2015 Asus 10\" Chromebook which outperforms this 2017 15\" Chromebook, and they were both the same price. I was hoping to \"trade-up\" but it looks like I'll keep the mini Chromebook and just use this 15\" Chromebook as a spare at the office. My Chromebook arrived refurbished, and I knew that going in when I purchased it. But sadly, mine arrived with schmutz all over the case (mainly on the bottom, and along the sides). The screen and keyboard were (thankfully) clean. But the rest of the case was honestly gross. We're talking about dirt, skin oils, and maybe food stains. I don't know what. Someone should have wiped this down with a rag before shipping it. It was absolutely disgusting to receive it with visible stains and foreign material on it. The screen quality is decent-enough. Technically, it may be \"HD,\" but it doesn't pop with color and brightness like many other HD screens. Reading emails, the text is kind of soft and fuzzy compared to my Asus PC latpop screen and Asus 10\" Chromebook. I'd give the Acer 15\" screen a 7/10 in the visual department. Again, not bad for the price, but certainly not up-to-par with other laptop screens we're now seeing. The speakers are awesome. Not only are they of good quality, but they face up! Frankly, it should be international law that all laptops have upward facing speakers so that we can actually hear them. The keyboard is excellent. Feels pro-quality, and it's not too loud (some cheap laptops have a clickity-clack problem). Could use this on a plane in first class and not disturb the blue-blood next to you with his poodle and monocle. Where this Chromebook really fails is in power. Now, I'm not expecting Cray Supercomputer here (have I dated myself yet?), but I was disappointed when I tried to run 4k video from YouTube. It was a complete no-go. Not entirely unexpected, but I was hoping a \"premium\" Chromebook could handle it. What's more disappointing is that it hiccuped a bit even on 1080 HD video from YouTube. That's no bueno. I tried watching a couple videos on this Chromebook and compared it to my PC, and the Chromebook just didn't have the mojo or gusto or eye of the tiger. In summary, this Chromebook is a good value overall, but it's far from premium. For the price, it's a worthy contended, But if you like to watch HD Netflix or other streaming film, I think I'd look for another laptop of Chromebook with better video capabilities. UPDATE: The day this refurbished model was delivered, I noticed that Walmart had brand new ones for less money. I'll be returning this used model."}, {"name": "Craig", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "September 16, 2017", "title": "Great Chromebook.

One thing that people will complain about is the amount of space that the laptop comes with. It\u2019s about 15gb. Before you freak out about that, let me explain WHY the storage is so small. Chromebooks use what are called web apps. That means you don\u2019t need to (or more accurately, can\u2019t) download programs. That being said, don\u2019t expect to be downloading games and movies. The battery life is about 12 hours (unless you use the computer the way I do. I\u2019ll explain later) The camera looks good, albeit slightly grainy. Well, when it\u2019s not skipping frames. With the main focus being on web apps, that would mean that you have to be online constantly to make the most use of the laptop. There are of course, a few offline comparable apps that you can find in the Chrome Web Store if you ever find yourself without connection. If you want to unlock the full potential (and very quickly run up your memory) you can take advantage of the fact that ChromeOS is Linux based and install Ubuntu.

I don't mean that in a bad way; that's just what the product is.  I wanted something for lite to medium duty, basic everyday online activity and my work as an online tutor.  I write a lot, so a lot of online research, and watch a lot of videos I've downloaded else where.  I figured this would be good for all that, and I think I was right.  You basically have functionality like a tablet:  Everything is done by, on or through the web, including storage.  You can't install programs, this thing has no hard drive.  You CAN download apps from the Google Play Store, and you will find most of what you want for free.  I was worried that I wouldn't be able to watch videos that I downloaded elsewhere on a USB drive, but it works fine.  Haven't tried music like that yet, or ebooks....the latter of which I doubt if there is any way to open unless they were purchased on this machine. This Chromebook is light, but I wouldn't say it feels durable; I wouldn't recommend you give it the slam test to see how it holds up.  Doesn't seem fragile...but it's plasticy, and that's to be expected. The one thing I DON'T like about it is the power adapter plug.  As we all know, this is the most blatant, in-your-face, ongoing scam on laptop users and has been since the beginning:  The whole machine depends on an unsupported, usually not well insulated, it's gonna break from stress not how but when plug in the side of the computer.  The plug always sticks out just BEGGING to take a hit from something, or be the point of impact in a drop.  Just plugging this one in feels like an act of senseless optimism; it is seriously a dainty little mini-plug in a plastic housed plug in the traditional back left side of the machine.  Sooner or later, the ground will come loose inside, and that's that.  It is total BS the manufacturers don't design this better.  But, that's what they want:  When it fails, and it will, the consumer gets the blame for it, and then you gotta buy a new machine.  Can they do better?  Ever see a Mac?  The magnetic connector they use solves all those problems; anything pulls on it, it just magnetically disconnects.  Anything pulls on one of these, and you suck up your seat pants until you see if the plug or the connection has been ruined.  It's just a matter of time before I'm propping the plug up with something to make it work, then one day....bzzt.  Gotta get a new machine because replacing the charger input port is more time and trouble and money than it's worth. But, that said, virtually all laptops have that issue.  The manufacturers see it as a built in way to keep selling new machines, and the consumer can't do anything about it.  So is it fair to criticize this machine for a systemic flaw in ALL laptops (except Macs)?  Eh, you decide. Overall, I'm perfectly happy with this thing.  I did some research and knew exactly what I was getting, and it's what I expected.  So I'm perfectly down with that.  But if you're expecting the full functionality of a full laptop computer (which most people waste 90 percent of the potential of, anyway), you may be frustrated or underwhelmed.  If you're expecting a cheap, functioning Chromebook with no obvious design flaws or inherent shortcomings, you'll probably be like me:  I'm not thrilled to the point of squealing and clapping my hands like a six year old girl that just got a newest Barbie for Christmas, but I didn't expect I would be.  This thing is cheap, a good value, gets exactly the job done that I bought it for, and should last long enough to be a solid value.  Nothing magical here, just a good value, if tablet functionality with a focus on online features if what you need. Except that GD power plug.  But we're all stuck in that slowly sinking ship.

The genius who designed the keyboard put the SEARCH button directly to the left of the A key.  Since there is no number pad, any experienced typer will have to reorient their typing stance from a center-left position to a dead-center position.

Additionally putting the search button directly to the left of the A key is so annoying I'm actually considering prying the key off so I stop accidentally pressing it.

My daughter uses a Chromebook for her class so this was also a plus. Very budget friendly and we have a laptop again in the household. Update: About 2 weeks into computer , the charger went out. Charger would not charge computer. Uuuugh. Seller had no replacement for it. Remember this is a refurbished item. Be careful. Bought a new charger and is back to good.

It was shipped free from Acer for $133 and I can't tell it from new !  It boots up very fast and searches the internet with super fast speed. My kids use the smaller screen versions of this at school and love to use this at home. I bought a $700 Dell laptop at the same time as this Chromebook and I have to say I much rather use the Acer Chrome for surfing the net..... It has no dvd drive or hard drive to eat power and make things run hot and slow.....  Battery life is awesome at about 3x longer surfing time than a laptop....and it doesn't get hot.... Has a small solid state drive on the motherboard to save small files like passwords and screensavers.... This is perfect for kids and adults to surf the net, watch Youtube, and access Google online games and software without the complications of running a laptop..... ( great for seniors ) It is not for someone looking to save gigabytes of pictures and files or run windows/firefox  programs.

I bought this laptop for $169, two days after i bought it the price dropped to $133, so pretty disappointed that I didn't even wait longer or no one offered me a discount or something......but anyways.......The laptop is sleek and pretty, no signs of being used. So far I've had no problems but let's be honest, I've only been on it for less than two hours. BUT when I first turned on my new computer it was running very slow (I'm blaming it on the fact that the battery was completely dead when i got it) and sat frozen on third set up screen for almost 30 minutes I was worried my laptop was no good...but it's been fine since then.

This refurbished Acer/Chromebook is nice! There is no clue it isn't brand new from the factory!

Which is very important when it's a gift for someone not so tech savvy as my 60yr old mother. Moves thru each step quickly, no lag, and provides continued instruction even after set up. Speakers and volume level is loud enough in a quiet place but you may need head phones in a louder atmosphere. Durability may not survive dropping or slamming it around because Amazon originally sent one that somehow was damaged in delivery and had to contact me to send out another. It does come in a bubble case that is pretty darn impressive but clearly still took damage in shipping process soo judgement call would be too not slam it around... i would hope. Battery life is good for now, she charged it over a 4 hour period on Dec 27th two days after Christmas, and has said she hasn't charged it since, today is the 31st!

Seller and Amazon were prompt and polite with my inquiry to return this for service or attempt a refund anyway.  My issue is plain and simple,.... I find no reason why a 6 mo. old, newly serviced laptop only lasted 6 mo!!!! All I did was surf the web for information and to shop on Amazon. Never dropped it. Never spilled anything on it. Never slammed it shut. Always kept a good charge on it. One evening I was gathering thanksgiving recipes, shut it down for only about a half hour, went to finish my recipe searches and BAM the sob is DEAD. I used my reliable kindle fire 5 to find possible troubleshooting steps to follow.

I purchased a new version (not refurbished) of the computer for $159.99. I have only had this computer for about 6 months and I have had continuous problems since I bought it. Most recently, I have noticed a high pitched buzzing noise coming from the computer that I cannot figure out how to get rid of. It is extremely irritating when I am trying to work - I work from home in a quiet environment so it is easy to hear. The only thing that helps drown it out is by playing music. However! The computer is set up to have \"apps\". I downloaded the Spotify app thinking that would work but it always freezes, lags, and then shuts down. So instead I have to play from my browser using the webplayer. I have excellent internet that works quickly with all of my other devices but my internet always seems to lag on my computer. I rarely use any of my devices at the same time other than using my phone while watching streaming services. I bought this computer to use for my business, however, it has proven to not be what I need. The computer in general is slow, lags a ton, and randomly shuts off at times. I was excited about having a computer that was google chrome enabled, but that perk usually is more annoying than it is helpful. I cannot tell you how often I accidentally hit the search button on the keyboard and then it takes me out of the window that I am using. I do not have a ton of items stored on my computer - I primarily use Google Drive. So the fact that my computer is so slow despite having little storage usage is somewhat annoying. A couple of things that I can say good about this computer: 1. The size is good 2. Sound quality is overall pretty good 3. Battery life is surprisingly good 4. The computer is in general light!

The screen isn't the best, but it is acceptable. Doesn't compare to my i7, 4k touchscreen laptop, but it's also about $800 cheaper. 2. The 1tb HDD is very slow, only 5400 RPM (really common on laptops without an SSD). 3. The memory installed is a single 4gb and a second 2gb module, so no dual channel. Really, under 8 gig of memory, just say no. When using the on CPU graphics, this is a serious handicap (not dual channel). Pluses: Built in DVD drive. Probably not important to a lot of people nowdays, but a plus still. Latest gen CPU from Intel, the i3 may be pretty mediocre, but if you are comparing it to a machine 3 years old, you'll be VERY happy. VERY easy access (3 small phillips head screws) to upgrade memory, hard drive, and an empty M.2 slot for an SSD (screw & standoff included). I've read people complaining that upgrading it themselves was \"not easy\". Acer unlike most companies makes it easy to upgrade, but it does require knowledge. The system as configured is indeed a cheap laptop, and poor performer. You can make it a very pleasant midrange performer by upgrading memory and adding an SSD. The SSD would give you the most noticeable improvement, the memory would allow more open tabs on your browser. Upgrade details: First get an 8 gig or larger USB stick. I used this: https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Digital-8GB-Traveler-Flash/dp/B00G9WHMHC/ Then go to Microsoft and use their media creation tool to create a bootable Windows 10 installer (64 bit). Use a #0 tip phillips head screwdriver to remove the 3 screws on the cover on the bottom. There is a small notch on one corner of the cover, pry it up from there (yes, it can seem like you'll break it). When you open the cover, to the left would be a hard drive, I recommend removing it. Just slide it to the left away from the connector it is plugged into, it's stiff, but once unplugged you can lift it out. Next to the two filled memory slots on the right, between the two memory sticks and the HDD, is the M.2 slot, and down toward you on the circuit board is the standoff that Acer has kindly provided the screw for. Remove the screw, slide your SSD at an angle into the M.2 slot, once seated (can't see the gold fingers on the dge of the SSD), it should hinge down to the top of the spacer, insert the screw you removed and tighten gently. Next, the two memory dimms, pop them out by taking the two levers (one on each side) and gently pulling away from the dimms, they should pop up. Angle in the two (matching) memory dimms, and again when seated properly (can't see the gold edge connecters) angle them down and the two latches should pop into place. Put the cover back on. Insert the USB key drive. Power it up, should boot into installing Windows 10. Select \"custom Install\". Select new install (not upgrade). Should bring up a screen to select the disk drive, if you've removed the hard drive and have a new SSD, just select the only drive and tell it to use it. If you've tried and failed on your SSD, delete all the disk partitions, and let it use the blank disk (no need to create partitions, format, or anything, just remove all the existing partitions). Microsoft will automatically read the license key where it is stored in non-volatile memory. Takes about 20-30 minutes to fully install windows, reboot, connect to a network, and install updates. This gives you a nice machine with dual channel memory, and an SSD. You can reinstall the HDD and format it to use as extra storage (that's what I did). It'll now boot in about 15 seconds to your desktop in Windows 10 if you use the two cheap options below. Might boot faster with the NVME drive, but you really won't notice. Bonus, nice clean install of Windows 10, without \"extra\" programs you don't need.

DESIGN With a bevy of ports including VGA and a DVD drive, plus its heavy weight, the E 15 screams \"work computer!\"  This isn't a bad thing, because it also feels substantial, including the monitor hinge.  Many laptops in this price range feel like they need to be babied to survive long.  There is a physical Ethernet port, an HDMI port, three USB 3.0 ports, and up to date 802.11ac WiFi.  One nice touch is that the matte plastic has that brushed look, giving it a bit more traction and style.  More importantly, and unlike many modern laptops, it is easy to service or upgrade. PERFORMANCE The 8th gen Core i3 2.2 Ghz CPU and 6 GB memory combine to give swift performance for most common tasks like word processing, web browsing in many tabs, and streaming video.  One shocking thing to me is how well it handled running its own 1080p screen, a second 1080p screen over USB 3.0, and a third 2560x1440 screen all at once without issue.  I was running multiple HD video streams and web browsing at the time on different screens.  My previous laptop that cost much more and had a dedicated GPU dropped a lot of frames in this configuration. I only notice the weaker CPU compared to my more expensive laptop with CPU intensive or heavy 3D tasks.  If you are running those, including things like gaming beyond the basics or rendering video, this may not be the right choice.  With that said, at this price, there is no great solution. I see another review talking about how slow the computer is, which makes me wonder if Windows was still installing updates.  Any new computer is going to be slow while all that happens in the background.  The network is being pushed, the hard drive is being run heavily, and the CPU is periodically busy.  The only thing noticeably slow is startup.  An SSD upgrade would speed things up substantially. SOFTWARE While I have to use Mac OS and Linux for work, Windows 10 is my favorite OS.  It is flexible and easy to work with, with the most support for hardware and usually no headaches installing new devices.  This version of Windows 10 is almost clean, but includes a few things that I would delete.  Namely, Norton Antivirus, which can cause issues and slowdown.  It is easy to delete and Windows 10 has an antivirus built in. DISPLAY It is obvious where costs were cut to get the low price when you see the monitor in action.  It has a large bezel, which is not such a big deal.  However, the colors are washed out and even more washed out when not looking directly at it.  It is one of the worst screens I have seen in a long time, and the main reason for dropping my score.  It is passable, but I would personally spend a little more for a screen with better blacks and sharper details if I was going to do a lot of writing on it. While people rarely use laptops outside, the screen is also not bright enough for that.  As someone who usually cranks down the brightness to save my eyes, that aspect is fine with me. If you are going to be docking it and using standalone monitors, it supports higher resolutions well. INTERFACE There is no touch screen, which I surprisingly miss because touch controls are so good in Windows 10.  But, they aren't critical.  The keyboard has nice travel and a proper full layout.  The trackpad isn't as responsive as a high end laptop and the clicks aren't as snappy, but it works properly and I haven't had to fight with it. BATTERY Wow, the long battery life is so much better than my previous laptop, whichcould last through a movie and then be done for.  This is likely due to the newest Intel CPUs being built for low power consumption in combination with Acer's lack of concern over a big heavy battery.  The result is that, as long as I charge it at night, battery life just isn't a concern.  There is even a charging port for phones or tablets that is functional with the laptop off, making this a replacement for USB batteries. The charging itself could be improved, with a relatively large power brick.  I was hoping they allowed charging over USB, but I don't think that is available.  I could be missing how to do it. EDIT: I forgot to mention the bright blue light that stays on when it is charging and shut down.  It is very annoying to have it in my bedroom.  A bit of electrical tape fixes it, but I wish it wasn't there to begin with."}, {"name": "kevin374", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "September 8, 2018", "title": "Exceeds expectations for the price", "review_text": "Bought this as a gift for my dad.. he just needed something to surf the web and play videos.  I bought this along with a 256GB ADATA SSD ($55) that I immediately installed with no issues.  The panel at the back has 3 screws that need to be removed and has a notch on one side that can be used to pry it open, it requires a little pressure to pop out but not too much.  You will find a m.2 slot to pop in a SATA3 ssd.  The retaining screw is included. Once the SSD is installed you need to go into disk management (Start > type \"Disk Management\") and format the new SSD drive as NTFS and it will assign a drive letter etc. After that plug in a USB flash drive and download Windows 10.  I created installable media on the USB flash drive, then went into the BIOS (press F2 at the Acer logo) and changed the boot order to USB, restart and follow the prompts to install on the new SSD.  When you are ready to reboot remove the USB and it will boot into the new Win10 on the SSD, you may get a menu that gives you the option to choose the boot drive.  To remove the mutliple boot options start msconfig (Start > type \"Msconfig\") Boot tab and delete the HDD boot option.  Then you can reformat the HDD. Quick observations - Display - I think it's fine, has classic TN panel issues but that is fully expected at this price point.  If you're looking at the display head on then it has a nice picture, brightness is average but overall it's acceptable.  For an entry level laptop I would say the Display is acceptable.  Pics of direct and off angle are attached in low light indoors conditions. HDD - Do not even think of using this laptop with the supplied HDD, it is a slow as hell... using an SSD makes the performance increase about 1000% so the only way I would use this is with installing an SSD.  The boot time with the HDD is about 1-2 minutes, with an SSD it's about 5-7 seconds so I make my point!!!  The Crystal Diskmark scores for the SSD and HDD are attached to see the difference. Trackpad - I just use an external mouse, my favorite is the M187 wireless from Logitech, mini mouse that costs $10... I hate all trackpads even on laptops that cost 4 times the price of this so just get an external mouse. Build quality - I would say that it is really nice, a bit flimsy may be but laptops are all flimsy, I have a $1000 surface that I don't think I would want to test it's toughness by dropping it so I think it's silly to debate toughness on a laptop, they are all relatively delicate - the Acer is well put together and looks nice. Battery life - pretty great, I got about 8 hours of continuous use which is phenomenal. Given the price this is a crazy good deal and most definitely exceeds expectations."}, {"name": "Louie", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "July 17, 2018", "title": "Install a 128gb SSD drive and Reinstall Win 10 and you will be very happy", "review_text": "original 07/11/18 - purchase date update 11/13/18 - still quite happy with this laptop...works well so far.. update 03/10/19 - still quite happy with this laptop...works well so far.. update 10/17/19 - still quite happy with this laptop...works well so far.. original review written on 7/17/18 If you are willing to install a 128gb SSD M.2 2280 card ($22.00) and reinstall windows 10 onto the SSD then this is a 5 star product.  Comes with bloatware and who knows maybe some foreign spyware that the reinstall of Win10 removes.  After installing the 128gb SSD and reinstalling windows 10 it performs extremely well for a $380 dollar laptop.  Installing the 128gb SSD is very easy by removing 3 screws holding the drive/memory cover on the bottom and slipping in 128gb SSD M.2 2280 card.  Reinstalling windows 10 is not that hard but it is much more involved.  Download and use the Microsoft Media Creation Tool (google this tool for helpful articles) to create a USB stick with Win10 Home and then boot from the usb stick (you may need to change a bios setting to boot from the usb stick rather than HDD) and windows will install itself in 30 minutes. You will be surprised that when you are done that it was just not that hard.  If you do the above you have a clean and fast machine. Notes on Win10 Install onto the 128gb SSD - note you will be installing Win10 to the SSD not the 1TB HDD so if you do not succeed you still can boot Win10 from the 1TB HDD - you can leave the network cable disconnected and/or wifi connection disabled during the Win10 install.  You do not need a microsoft online account to install Win10....you actually may not want microsoft online account to reduce the data collected about you by microsoft....of course if you are using some of microsoft online services then you will need one...i prefer to disable Cortana and i do not use OneDrive. - during the Win10 install make sure you have selected the 128GB SSD and not the 1TB HDD drive - during the install you can remove all the partitions on the SSD card and the Win10 install will recreate the partitions it needs. - after the Win10 install go into the Bios and ensure the SSD is marked as the boot drive - after the Win10 install and reboot run a microsoft update to get Win10 up to date...this will take 60 minutes - after installing Win10 disable microsoft data collection by going into Settings/Privacy and turn everything off. - it is best to go thru every single Win 10 setting (yes it is quite painful) and turn off all the features that border on privacy invasion such as allowing apps access to location data, allowing all apps to access the camera...it goes on and on...etc... - once you are booting Win10 from the SSD you can reformat the 1TB C:/ drive to recover the space and use it to store data.

The laptop features the Intel i3-8130U 8th generation (latest generation for 4/2018, a 2 core processor), a 1TB drive and 6gb RAM.  The battery is supposed to last for 12 hours (I tested this a bit but not a lot).  The laptop has 6gb, a read/write DVD drive, and a lot of connections and a 1920 x 1080 display. The laptop is responsive and  snappy for an under $400 laptop.  I\u2019m a bit perplexed by some of the reviews claiming this to be slow.  It is not.  This value laptop has some chops.  I loaded my desired suite of applications with Ninite dot com, that went quickly. In testing performance, I ran a Netflix movie and a show on YouTube at the same time with no performance degradation.  I ran the 2+ hour movie twice while doing other stuff on the laptop and the battery still showed over 7 hours left. This laptop has a lot of connectors: USB, HDMI, and even a VGA connection (which I would suggest dropping, if you need that just put a HDMI/VGA adapter in your computer bag).  Also included is the R/W DVD drive... something becoming rare in laptops.  A nice option to watch movies if desired. The laptop display is good but has a poor viewing angle.  I wasn\u2019t surprised, my guess is that this is the display was where trade-offs were made to get the laptop to this price.  The display is hard to see from the side (a witty salesperson would claim this is great for privacy) and required tilting the display forward/back more than I liked to obtain the best viewing angle from the front. The speakers surprised me.  The speaker volume is typical to most laptops in that I wish it would be about 20% louder at max.  The speakers seems to be nice but not amazing, at least until I was lying on a couch watching a movie with the laptop on my chest.  The nearness of my ears to the speakers allowed me to hear a very nice spacial mix of the sound.. the movie sound track \"bloomed\" at that point and was surprisingly good.  Bear in mind, I practically had to have the laptop a foot or two from my face for this to kick in.

However, as others have suggested, there are three things you should consider to do in order to reach this laptop's full potential: 1) Delete all the bloatware's that comes with the laptop. The laptop comes with a lot of programs like Norton (only 30 days free trial) which slows the laptop a lot, constantly keeping HDD usage at 100%. You should go into control panel -> uninstall programs and remove all the unecessary programs. 2) You might want to defrag the HDD. Out of the box, the HDD that comes with the laptop was 23% defragmented. To defrag, type \"defragment\" in your windows search bar and Windows 10's defrag and optimize drive tool should show up. Click \"optimize\" to start defragging the HDD. Optimizing it made a heck load of difference for my laptop. 3) Add in an SSD M.2 2280 as a primary drive (for OS, boot and your most used files/programs) and use the 1TB HDD as secondary drive. There are loads of online tutorials which shows you how to do this. For me, I bought a 256gb m2 2280 SSD on Amazon, opened up the removable panel on the back of the laptop, removed the silver screw (SSD slot is located beside the RAM), slot the SSD in, used a random cloning software I found online to clone the files in the HDD to the SSD, removed and cleaned the HDD and set my booting priority to the SSD. There are tons of ways you can do this and after the process, it takes only 3-5 seconds for the laptop to boot from shut down, and with the 8th gen i3 CPU, the performance is beyond impressive for its price."}, {"name": "Sali", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "September 13, 2018", "title": "Very good home computer with subpar hard drive", "review_text": "I bought this laptop for my sophomore who wanted one in his dorms to do his home work, mostly browsing, and MS office (or equivalent). The feature I am most impressed with is its long battery life, wow, just wow. The laptop looks good, it feels good, its light weight and relatively thin. Its keyboard is not that great, feels little flimsy and it perhaps is flimsy. Like some other reviewers have mentioned, the screen colors are not vivid and it was real pain to watch some old low resolution movies; the colors were acceptable for more recent movies though. Sound, well, thats kind of weak too but some decent quality bluetooth speakers/headphones can be connected without much hassle. Now the weakest feature that literally flushes this otherwise fine laptop's performs down the drain is its hard drive. I know laptop hard drives are generally not the fastest, and on all my laptops I have replaced them with SSDs, but on this computer, its really really slow. Maybe its because the windows 10, maybe its because the RAM is shared (with the graphic chip), I don't know. I tossed out the existing 1TB hard drive and replaced it with with a $45 Kingston SSD (A400 SSD 240GB SATA 3 2.5\u201d Solid State Drive SA400S37/240G, also from Amazon). The difference in performance was something. It appeared that I was dealing with an entirely different laptop and not the one I un-boxed and booted just a few hours ago. Now for laymen a 1TB hard drive is a good incentive, and well, it does offer lots of space to store all kinds of data, photos, movies, songs etc. However, if the performance of the laptop is so sluggish with a barely 5% full hard drive, just imagine what kind of a performance you will get with like 50% or more full hard drive? With files scattered all over the place, the performance gets deteriorated and badly. Files can always be stored on flash drives or SD cards (you can buy very large capacity flash drives or SD cards for reasonable price), they can also be stored on external hard drives, or even on the DVD-RWs. So if you want to stick to a slow hard drive for capacity, you may want to revisit your approach. To sum up, its a fine laptop, its large screen, long battery life, and light weight are important pluses, and with a SSD (a minimum of 240 gb of course), it rocks. Its no gaming laptop, and to be honest with you, that was one of the reason I chose it for my sophomore LOL, but its a reasonable laptop for home/office related jobs. Its performance can certainly be improved significantly by adding RAM. Its two slots are occupied with 4 and 2 gb RAM modules which means to upgrade it, you will have to literally toss out the 2gb module. A single module 8 gb costs less than $40; 8 gb + 4 gb, 12 gb is going to make this computer a good multitasking machine for sure. And yes, you can always sell your 1TB hard drive for like $30-40 on ebay or letgo or similar sites. Or you can convert it into an external hard drive. You need something called an 'enclosure', they convert your regular hard drive into an external hard drive and cost less than $30."}, {"name": "A", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "October 25, 2018", "title": "$360 Russian Roulette!", "review_text": "I set my expectations low with the price point of this laptop, but expected it to function at the very least. Unfortunately it cannot. It\u2019s incredibly slow, which isn\u2019t a big deal, expected at $360, but it will not update. I cannot get windows to update. I had it downloading updates for 5 hours and the final download wouldn\u2019t pass 6% even after sitting for over an hour for this download alone. If you use the internet at all do not purchase this. Web pages take a while to load, or won\u2019t load completely, regardless of browser. Meanwhile I hop on my desktop, phone, any other device and the internet works flawless so I know my internet is fine. Went through and updated all the drivers without any success. Videos won\u2019t load either. Yeah, the screen is 1080p, but if you try to watch a random youtube video at just 720p, it cannot go more than 5-10 seconds without buffering for 3-4x that amount. I tried resetting the laptop and have spent hours attempting to make this work. Maybe a defective model, but something is definitely wrong. My old HP Pavilion that was 5 years old worked better. If you purchase this laptop make sure you have a smartphone or something so you can watch youtube videos to bypass the wait of loading your favourite homepage or email. Aside from all of the cons, the battery life seems decent. Probably because the computer is barely functional and the battery is quite literally just powering the screen. I think the HDD takes a nap or something once it wears itself out from starting up. Touchpad is okay, fairly responsive, comfortable to use. This is definitely a place where you feel what you paid for, same goes for the keyboard. Keyboard is okay, Caps Lock doesn\u2019t light up or anything so it always keeps you guessing when entering passwords for online accounts. Who knew logging into websites could be a fun game! Nonetheless the keyboard feels cheap as to be expected. Picture quality is decent. If videos would load i\u2019m sure the laptop wouldn\u2019t be too bad for simple tasks, using word, very light internet surfing, staring at your 240 I mean 1080p background picture.

Sound quality, I shouldn\u2019t even have to address this. Its a laptop, they shouldn\u2019t even come with internal speakers at this point. Buy an externet speaker set. I got an Amazon Basics set 4 or so years ago and they work pretty well. Not perfect, but a huge upgrade for $15. Overall feels worth it for ~$360 if you receive a working model.

It boots up in about 5 sec. Also, when you boot it up for the first time after cloning the HDD, it will automatically boot to the SSD. To get into Bios just press F2 and hold as soon as you see the Acer logo when booting up. There is new Firmware for the Bios at the Acer website and also fixes for the Intel chip hacks (Specter and Meltdown). You should probably do these ASAP."}, {"name": "Jenny Lou", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "December 6, 2018", "title": "Nightmare. Total Nightmare", "review_text": "I hesitate to leave such a horrible review but it has been a 5 day nightmare for me and it does't seem to be over yet. The browser would close on its own and open a random window that I did not open. I heard myself talking through the laptop speakers and looked behind the window I had open and was staring back at myself because the computer had opened Skype all by itself. Suddenly, I couldn't open any items on the desktop. The cursor would move but clicking on items wouldn't open them. It wouldn't type into the search bar, and the Windows Icon (far bottom left) wouldn't open to allow me to reboot. I had to force reboot by holding the power button (which I hate to do). Then, the \"restarting\" wheel just swirled and swirled... When I tried to backup my files by plugging in my external hard drive, it recognized it okay and opened the window to show the files, while I was looking it, it suddenly closed that window and opened another window. Then, while transferring files from the laptop to the external drive, I started getting the message, \"Are you sure you want to save this file without its properties\"? WTH? Also, when I clicked the Windows Icon (lower left) that opens to show the programs in alphabetic order, suddenly before my eyes, all names and icons of the programs disappeared and a random alphabet appears... A B C D etc with no names or icons. But, when I clicked the Windows Icon again, it all came back. It literally felt like there was a ghost in the laptop or someone was controlling it from elsewhere. I  have been on the phone with Amazon, Acer, and even Microsoft Windows.  I had already spent two days re-installing all my files and software (winzip, video editing software, Microsoft Word, Norton) only to ultimately restore Windows to factory settings while on the phone with Microsoft. This is when the problem occurred while trying to backup my files to the external drive... which caused me to fear that my external device was now corrupted. That device held 8 years of research with documents and images I had created. It held the backup of 4 books I had written, the family tree book I had been working on since 2012, and all our ancestors photos I had restores and only I had this family data. I had my wedding photos and photos of my deceased mother who just passed and my deceased brother who died in 1976 in a car accident, my daughter's baby pictures... So, I was horrified when I plugged the drive in after the factory restore and got the message that the external drive was not recognized. Thankfully! Thankfully! My brother helped me retrieve my data from it. I had bought my husband the exact same laptop but from another vendor and his didn't have these problems. The seal on my laptop had not been broken but Amazon customer service had said, \"So, you bought this on Nov 14th\". No... I bought it on Nov 29th. Then she said, \"No problem, I'll just change that for you\". Which makes me wonder what happened between Nov 14th and the 29th? A fluke? Last night around 1am, my Kindle starts alerting me of Yahoo email login failures and something about failures to log into Amazon through my Yahoo email. This is a full 5 days after this all started. So, at 2 am I up changing all my passwords to every account I own; my bank, Paypal, Amazon, Yahoo email... etc'.  I have demanded that Acer investigate by tracing the laptop though its SN number but am told they can't do that. It is their responsibility to ensure that their customer receive a clean computer. I have been emotionally exhausted, emotionally distraught, mentally exhausted and physically exhausted and I shouldn't have had to go through this. Customers should't have to restore their laptop Windows back to factory settings. But, my husband's laptop was fine. Somebody, somewhere, did something to the laptop I received and I feel it should be investigated. Maybe this feedback will make that happen. Or, maybe they will just come after me instead. That would be a lot easier than tracing where their corrupted laptop came from."}, {"name": "Hannah F.", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "September 19, 2018", "title": "Look for a different product", "review_text": "The computer is extremely slow.

What do you want for $329? I've swapped out the 1TB hard drive for a $70 Crucial 500GB NVMe PCIe SSD  (https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07J2WBKXF/( and swapped out the 6GB of memory it came with for a  $68 16GB (2 8GB-SODIMMs) kit from Samsung (https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KEAEX54/) . With these added-on bits, performance is far faster than most \"ordinary folks\" will need anytime soon. (I'm a former computer network engineer, and I've very happy with it.) There are several videos on YouTube showing how easy it is to do both of these parts swaps: remove 3 screws and cover plate (carefully!), remove m.2 hold-down screw, insert NVMe PCIe drive, reinsert and gently(!) tighten m.2 hold-down screw, remove and replace memory SODIMMs, replace cover plate and 3 screws = Done! Attached is a 15-second video showing Windows 10  booting to a log-in screen in about 8 seconds, at least half of which time is spent bootstrap loading the Acer bios. The included Acronis True-Image software worked fine in transferring the OEM Windows image to the SSD. After the transfer completed successfully, I did a \"Fresh Start\" to get a perfectly clean Windows install without any of the useless  trial software which Acer is famous for burdening its laptops (and their users) with. Had I a chance to do things over, I'd spend the extra few dollars and get the $104 1TB version of the Crucial SSD (https://smile.amazon.com/Crucial-1TB-NAND-NVMe-PCIe/dp/B07J2Q4SWZ/), which offers much higher data transfer speeds, although the performance difference is really only noticeable when moving very large files about. See PCWorld's comparative review at www[.]pcworld[.]com/article/3337244/crucial-p1-nvme-ssd-review.html. There is a second comparative review at www[.]pcper[.]com/reviews/Storage/Crucial-P1-500GB-and-1TB-M2-NVMe-SSD-Review-More-QLC . FWIW I was also able to use EaseUS Todo PCTrans to then migrate most of my applications and files from my old laptop to this new one. A few licensed apps needed to be reinstalled with new activation keys, but most worked right away without any issues. I used a 1TB USB drive to effect this transfer as moving this much data via my (very fast--I am a former computer network engineer!) home WiFi network would have taken 12 hours or more. I  took two stabs at it; on the first try, I tried to tell PCTrans exactly what to move, without a particularly good result. On the second, I just let it do what it wanted to do and all was good. BTW I used Macrium Reflect (free version) to capture a backup image of the original 1TB factory hard drive before making any software modifications, and to capture an additional backup image of the SSD after each significant modification had been made. Doing so gave me the option to undo any modification step that that might happen to go awry. I plan to reinstall and reformat the 1TB drive and use it going forward as a convenient repository for automated daily system backups made using Macrium Reflect. Hope this helps a few folks!

Looking at the specifications for the computer, the components that I most wanted to change were the mechanical hard drive and the mismatched pair of DIMMs that will prevent operating in dual-channel mode.  Fortunately, the laptop is designed to make both of those components easily replaceable. I replaced the HDD with an SSD and upgraded the RAM to an 8GB dual-channel kit.  Before swapping out the HDD, I went into the BIOS, added a password, and disabled secure boot.  I'm not sure if the password was necessary, but my last Acer laptop would lock out the HDD after a change unless the BIOS password was set, so I set the password on this one as well.  The upgrade process was quick and easy thanks to the access panel in the back of the laptop.  The SDD from the old laptop had an installation of Ubuntu 16.04 with the HWE stack, and everything worked well without making any new changes to the OS (I did have the minor workaround of changing the line \"GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT = \u201cquiet splash\u201d\"  to \"GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT = \u201cquiet splash acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor\u201d\" in /etc/default/grub already setup on my old laptop, so that may still be necessary for a new install).  After the upgrades, the laptop seems very responsive to me.  Of course, Ubuntu on an SSD is a very different setup from the laptop as shipped, so I really can't say what the user experience of Windows 10 on the HDD would be like. As others have commented, the screen is not the best, but it is good enough if you're not doing graphic design or gaming.  Also, I don't understand the fuss about the lack of a backlit keyboard, as I don't look at the keyboard while I type anyway."}, {"name": "Daniel", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "January 1, 2019", "title": "Its a hobby just by itself!", "review_text": "Okay, I am definitely not a typical user.  I got this because it had excellent reviews and everyone said it was a fantastic deal hardware vs value.  (I purchased it at $324, although I missed the $315 price which was only there for less than a day) Everyone also mentioned that it only started feeling peppy after the mechanical HDD was replaced by an SSD. I can only blame the available holiday sales because my first choice was to upgrade the SSD to an M.2 NVMe 500GB drive.  To those who asked, yes, it can indeed run an NVMe drive.  I am pretty sure the bus can't handle a full speed one so I purchased a cheap one that had merely 2000MB/s Read and 1750 MB/s for 89.99.  Yes, it works and it works great! https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07J2WBKXF/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Then I saw another sale of a normal 2.5\" SSD.  A 1TB SSD.  I have a small Diskstation from Synology so it was easy to convince myself that I could replace the existing 2.5\" drive.  I can always use the extra drives.  $127.98.  You could easily get this instead of the M.2 one above and from what most people say, you wouldn't notice the difference. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078DPCY3T/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Then, of course, it was noted that since the RAM chips are different sizes it is only operating in single channel mode instead of dual channel mode.  Well off to e-bay to get 16GB of memory.  56 dollars.  No link since it was used, not a store sale. It presently has KINGSTON  PC3L-12800S, 1600MHz, 204 pin, 11-11-C3 2GB+4GB SODIMM. Then I noted that the external mouse I used had an annoying nub sticking out from the mouse receiver.  Okay, off to get a bluetooth mouse.  The one I got has dual modes that can work with my work laptop too. $13.99. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CH1ZZFP/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Now this version of the laptop does not have a backlit keyboard.  My eyes are getting weak in my old age so I wondered if you could replace the keyboard with a backlit version.  After some research, I found you could, but it required soldering some components to the board.  While I am an electrical engineer it looked a bit riskier than I was comfortable with, so I went with the next best thing.  Fluorescent keyboard stickers.  They work pretty darn well.  Very visible and although it took some getting used to, not THAT ugly. $9.96. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CJPS66/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 One of the reasons I bought the laptop was it had a DVD.  I have movies and when I go on vacation or even a business trip I may bring one along.  I can use an external case but I like all in one solution.  The issue?  It's a DVD.  All my newer videos are blueray.  Fortunately, the drive is easy to take out.  Be careful.  The tabs for the bezel are fragile and the cheapest replacement bezel is about $15 and it's still unclear if it has the right form factor.  One of the reasons I got this is that I have extra slim external blueray drives.  I had intended to cannibalize one and stick it in my new laptop.  The problem was that the drive slot is for a 9mm high DVD.  Mine were 12mm high.  Whoops, that wasn't in the specs.  To be honest I didn't even know they came in 9mm size.  Well off to E-bay to get a 9mm blueray.  $45 not including shipping. Link removed since only amazon links are allowed whoops! UJ273, SATA-9mm, Blu-ray-dvd-burner-rewritable-BD-RW-drive Then I started to really notice a drawback to the laptop.  The LCD panel.  At any angle except straight on it was washed out and faded.  Even looking straight on video was... pretty terrible.  Okay, research mode.  Can I upgrade to an IPS screen and get a touchscreen?  No.  Apparently, a digitizer needs to be built into the motherboard (maybe a future upgrade;) in order to use a touchscreen.  An IPS screen replacement was cheap and after looking over Youtube DIY videos, its actually really easy upgrade.  A previous reviewer even supplied a model number and since then an Amazon seller was supplying them pretty cheap.  The increase in usability was breathtaking.  I regret nothing. $37.00. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JMM89NC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 My final upgrade came about noting how annoying to was to type in my password every time it woke up from sleep mode.  An extra ten to twenty seconds!  Intolerable!  Off to get a fingerprint reader to enable Windows Hello. Logging in with a finger swipe.  Of course, now I got a USB Dongle thingie again.  Hmm. Two steps forward, one step back.  Cheap but it took two weeks to ship despite being marked Prime. $21.99 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073Z6NZCJ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Okay, most people aren't going to be doing all of that.  It was more of a hobby than any real need.  Frankly, the only thing that was necessary was the SSD replacement.  I am hoping to recoup some of the cost by reselling the parts I removed on e-bay. I have a full-fledged gaming rig but I haven't played games in a while so I temporarily retired it in order to put the laptop through normal use for a while.  I connected the VGA port and the HDMI to a 4k monitor.  In general, it was extremely usable.  RAM use is consistently at 7 GB.  If I had only 8GB I don't know if I would be experiencing slowdowns (generally RAM is not 100% usable by programs). For business use, I usually have two Word documents up and referenced.  For shorter documents, I may not notice lag but my documents are over 300 pages (I am a writer as a hobby).  In documents this large there is a bit of spikey lag.  I suppose as it saves in the background and scrolls to the next bit to be viewed.  It's not horrible but definitely there. Internet browsing is seamless.  I have 6-8 tabs open and there is no delay in switching.  Youtube IT reviews and DIY videos are excellent experiences, especially with the new screen. As for gaming... I haven't played much in a while but after I did all that work so I wanted to see if I could do anything with the Intel 620 graphics.  I booted up Diablo 3.  Settings on full.  Wow, no stuttering, beautiful experience.  I put it the big 4k screen and notice its suddenly running in a window.  Full stop!  Horrible from rate!  Ugh.  Change it back to Fullscreen 1080 and suddenly its butter smooth!  An old game but still delightful.  More importantly its delightful on this laptop. Next, I load Fallout 76.  Yes.  I bought it.  Yes.  I regret it.  It loads up fine but the character creation is hideously painful.  Not because of the of the graphics but because there is a huge cursor lag of 5 seconds. Odd.  I start up the game on minimum settings.  It does load, it does have horrible framerates that I don't think I could bear (if I could bear the actual game) but it runs.  At low settings, it ugly as sin and moving feels like your constantly encumbered but it does run. Now when I installed the SSD I did a fresh install, so I didn't notice the bloatware mentioned by other people.  I installed it in a UEFI format... which was surprisingly tricky while using a USB install stick.  Supposedly this format will boot faster.  I have noticed that it doesn't always come up from sleep mode gracefully and I have to reboot it.  I fiddled with the power settings and now it comes up from sleep mode reliably and doesn't ignore the keyboard and mouse (Bios setting plus power setting).  I am presently worrying whether it will go to sleep reliably since I had to disable sleep on the closing lid.  Also, the fingerprint sensing on logging in from waking on sleep seems to have issues sensing fingerprints at first.  Logging in with password and then logging in and out makes the fingerprint sensor work... but this defeats the purpose of a fingerprint sensor if I can't figure out to make it work reliably upon waking."}, {"name": "Khaled Al-Suwaidi", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "August 17, 2018", "title": "Change the HDD to an SSD!", "review_text": "For the price, it's a great college laptop.

I learned this the hard way. But it's fine since I already own a gaming PC, and it's a good thing too since I won't play games while in the university library instead of studying like I should be :)  The trackpad is sort of sticky and doesn't have a slippy film that helps with finger movement. With higher temperatures and sweatier fingers, it can be a little annoying. A cheap wireless mouse, however, remedies this.  The screen has severe light bleed but I didn't expect any better. It hurts my eyes in my dark room but in the uni library it doesn't make a difference For my use case: 8/10. It lost a few points since I had to buy a 50$ SSD to replace the slow HDD.

She doesn\u2019t do video games or anything in any way computationally intensive.  At the time of purchase (April 2019), the price was $329.  I read a lot of the reviews and appreciated all the helpful information.  People were recommending installing a solid state drive (SSD) to reduce boot time and increasing the memory (RAM) size to allow the computer to operate faster.  I decided in advance of ordering this computer to do both of those things. I hope this review will be useful and maybe address some of the difficulties reported by others. After receiving the computer and going through Windows setup, everything seemed to be working ok.  It was extremely difficult to insert USB devices into the ports the first time.  It took so much force, I was afraid something would break.  That improved with continued use.  I bought some USB flash memory sticks and created a Windows 10 Recovery USB drive.  (SanDisk Cruzer CZ36 32GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive, Frustration-Free Packaging- SDCZ36-032G-AFFP for $6.99 each). Some reviewers said they were not able to get into the BIOS, but I had no problem getting into BIOS by tapping the F2 key during boot-up. At least one reviewer said wifi performance was poor and replaced the wifi card.  I did not have that problem, wifi reception was excellent, never dropped out, was ok waking from sleep. I had no wifi problems at all. On the Acer website, I selected Support then chose Drivers and Manuals from that dropdown menu.  I entered model E5-576-392H but that didn\u2019t work.  I found the SNID number on the label on the bottom of the computer and entered that, which took me to a list of the things available to download.  I downloaded the User Manual PDF files.  I did not download and install any device drivers or BIOS revision.  One reviewer cautioned against installing the BIOS revision, so that made me cautious.  On the web I found and downloaded a free DVD player program (VLC) and played part of a movie DVD to verify DVD operation.  I downloaded Adobe Reader, PrimoPDF, and some other utility programs that I like.  I signed my wife up for Microsoft Office 365 personal and downloaded those programs.  (I have been a ribbon hater, but decided to finally master that and quit complaining\u2026ordered latest copies of Word and Exel Bible \u2013 used from Amazon.) After a few days of operating and testing, a memory upgrade was ordered.  This computer came with one 2GB and one 4GB memory sticks as other reviewers have described.  Some just bought a single 4 GB for a very low price to replace the 2 GB, but I decided to buy a 16 GB kit (two 8GB) of a brand I was familiar with for $87.98 (Crucial 16GB Kit (8GBx2) DDR3/DDR3L 1600 MT/S (PC3-12800) Unbuffered SODIMM 204-Pin Memory - CT2KIT102464BF160B).  That was easy to install and operated ok.  There was a YouTube video of how to do the install. After I installed the memory upgrade but before I ordered the SSD, I wanted to run a free memory test program (MemTest86).  That required making a USB flash memory drive with the MemTest86 program on it and booting from it.  I could see the USB drive in the BIOS and move it to the top of the boot order, but I could not get the computer to actually boot from it.  And when I went back into the BIOS, it showed the boot order change had not been preserved.  This not being able to successfully change the boot order was a worry.  More about that, and how it turned out, later. Reviewers were saying conflicting things about installing an SSD.  Some reviewers replaced the HDD with an equivalent SATA SSD.  Some reviewers said that a new M.2 type SSD could not coexist with the HDD that came installed in the computer.  One reviewer claimed to have confirmed this with Acer tech support!!  I found a YouTube video that seemed to contradict that and at least one reviewer said they had both drives operating simultaneously.  I wanted to install an M.2 style SSD, which I had no previous experience with, and hoped I could use it for boot drive C and keep the 1TB mechanical drive as drive E for additional storage (the DVD drive is drive D).  At that point in time, I didn\u2019t know if that plan would work out or not. From the reviews and Wikipedia, it seemed there are at least two types of M.2 style SSDs, one type with a SATA interface, the other type with an NVMe interface which is faster and also more expensive.  One reviewer said, yes the NVMe interface is faster, but you will never see the difference unless you are doing something very heavy duty computationally.  That had the ring of truth to it, so I bought Crucial MX500 500GB 3D NAND SATA M.2 Type 2280SS Internal SSD - CT500MX500SSD4 for $66.99.  The connecter end of this M.2 SSD circuit board had two little cutouts, with a few connectors on left and right, and a wide section in the middle. The socket in the computer had only one interference nib. Temporary major panic quandary, which side of the M.2 SSD should be up!!  Then I realized the small sections on each side of the SSD were not the exact same width, so it would actually insert only one way. Whew.  When I powered up the computer, the new drive did not show up in the BIOS, but I clicked on the Windows button and in the pop-up menu I scrolled down to Windows Administrative Tools, selected Computer Management, then selected Disk Management and it was there as uninitialized disk 2. I didn\u2019t do anything more at this point. The YoutTube video I found for my exact computer (title \u201cHow to clone Acer Aspire E5 576 392H HDD to SSD make boot drive without reinstalling Windows 10\u201d) used a program EaseUS Todo.  Unfortunately, the free version of that program did not have the cloning feature.  I would have to buy the program to get that feature.  I found another YouTube video for a Dell laptop (title \u201cHow to Clone Windows from a Hard Disk to an M.2 SSD (and Keep It Bootable)\u201d).  It was beautifully made and used a slick free program Macrium Reflect, and when it was done it booted from the new SSD and the HDD had a different drive letter.  In the container with my Crucial M.2 SSD was a little paper that said go to the Crucial website/clone and get a download there. That was Acronis TrueImage which is a program I am familiar with and has been around for years. I installed Acronis and followed the prompts using automatic mode.  When it finished, there was no second drive showing in File Explorer.  Repeating the steps above to get back to the Disk Management window, the SSD was there and formatted. but had not been assigned a drive letter.  I thought about doing something there, but did not.  I decided to shut down the computer and take out the HDD, then reboot to see if it would boot off the M.2 SSD. After removing the bottom cover, it was not obvious to me how to remove the HDD.  I found another YouTube video title \u201cAcer Install a Hard Drive and Do a Fresh Install of Windows 10\u201d that showed I could just slide the HDD out, which I did.  Then when I booted into the BIOS, the Information page showed no HDD0, and the SSD showed as HDD1.  On the Boot page, Windows Boot Manager was showing the model number for the HDD1. The boot time into Windows was much faster.  All the programs were there and worked, so the clone was successful.  In Windows Disk Management, the new SSD showed as drive C. The question was, when the 1TB HDD was put back into the computer, how to achieve the computer seeing the new SSD as boot drive C and the old HDD as drive E?  What determined which drive it would boot from, was it the BIOS?  I put the old HDD back in.  When I powered up the computer, I was slow to hit F2, so I missed getting into the BIOS.  However, Windows booted fast to my surprise.  I got into Disk Management, and lo and behold there was the new 500GB SSD as drive C and the old 1TB HDD as drive E.  I didn\u2019t have to do a darn thing.  Windows and the BIOS figured it out by themselves.  Windows File Explorer showed both drives. I powered down and back up a few times, always with the same good result.  So I don\u2019t know why some reviewers had a problem with having both drives in.

Some of the main things I was looking for with a new laptop was a 1080p display, an optical drive, the ability to install an SSD, and a decent processor, all for about $300. The first thing I did with this laptop was replace the 1TB HDD with a 250GB Samsung SSD, which was quite easy. It took me a bit to realize the drive needed to slide horizontally to be unplugged before being lifted out (duh). I may increase the RAM in the future, but for the time being, 6GB is sufficient. Overall I'm quite pleased with this laptop. It's working well as a light-duty computer for browsing the internet, streaming movies, and doing some light processing when I'm not at my main workstation. It boots quickly and generally works as expected. The build quality is not the same as the ThinkPad, but I wasn't expecting that since the ThinkPad was a top-end model in it's day and was quite solidly built.

Primarily, the main problem is that the quick start process -- which actually begins when you shut down the laptop after your prior use -- can cause the laptop to hang when shutting down.  I had to disable the quick start options and just use the regular shut down and start up, which makes the start up process nearly five minutes long. It's 1 1/2 minutes from power on to the point you put in your PIN, then another 2 1/2 minutes before the Windows Defender Security Center turns from the red exclamation mark to the green all clear (or sometimes yellow warning triangle, more on that later). You need Defender to say everything is ready before you can get online, otherwise your browsers and apps will just hang until it's decided your antivirus and firewall are working. That leads to the second big problem: Norton. Norton is the only antivirus I could find that worked with this laptop, the other programs I tried simply didn't register with Defender and it would constantly tell me I had no firewall or no antivirus. Norton isn't that pricey so I just went with it, but it takes so long to start up that it adds another 1 1/2 to 2 minutes onto start-up time because your browser can't work until the Norton icon in the task bar has a green checkmark showing all clear. Windows Defender, meanwhile, has some kind of bug where it tells me there's a warning and I get the yellow warning triangle, but when I go to see the warning, there's nothing there. Also, as I mentioned in my original review, the sleep functions simply lock up the computer too often to use. I had to disable them completely, which reduces battery life. I use a screen saver so I won't get burn-in or anything, but it would have been nice if I'd been able to let the laptop idle or sleep when not in use. Instead, I have to turn it on or off, or let it idle as the battery drains. For this price the machine really should be better than it is. It's okay for watching movies, email and social media, and once the laptop is actually up and running after the lengthy startup it's okay, but the amount of work I had to go through to keep it from washing out the image (see below in my original review) and locking up is unreasonable. ORIGINAL REVIEW: This laptop has been pretty glitchy for me in terms of locking up when it goes to sleep, and in not keeping the color and brightness settings consistently. I was going to return the laptop at first but after reading reviews and playing with some settings decided to keep this, as this was mostly meant to be a portable web browser and DVD player for me to use in the bedroom. If I needed it for anything heavier than that, I would have sent it back. The longer story: One of the very first things that happened on this laptop was that the screen just went blank for no reason. It happened twice, the first time when I closed the lid briefly during the setup process, the second time after I let the laptop sit and idle until sleep kicked in, at which point I couldn't wake the screen up. The only solution was to hold down the power button for about 15 seconds and restart, which caused instability on the machine when I turned it back on. A search shows that this laptop has that problem a lot. There are several solutions to this problem and I wanted to share what worked for me. First, I make sure neither the screen nor the laptop goes into sleep mode by setting all the power settings to Never, and go out to Additional Power Settings and put them on Never, too. Then change the option for closing the lid to Do Nothing on all drop down menus. That doesn't actually fix all of the problems (and of course it uses battery, because it never goes idle) but it helps a lot. Still, closing the laptop lid, even though it's supposed to \"do nothing,\" causes the laptop to lock up. Nothing has fixed that problem for me so far. There was also a big problem with the laptop not shutting off when I turn it off. It goes into sleep and the power light and fan stay on, and it can't be turned off unless you hold down the power button. I had to do that that about 25% of the time, but eventually found that turning off the fast startup option solved it. The laptop doesn't boot as fast BUT you don't have to force the laptop to shut down by holding the power button down, which to me is worth it. Also, one solution for the laptop getting stuck in idle is to dial back the graphics driver to a previous version, which I did -- on this laptop, that previous version is a 2006 driver, but so far it's been okay and hasn't given me any trouble. Because of the locking up during the setup process when I first got the laptop, the unit was very unstable. You couldn't change volume, some apps wouldn't open, etc. A reinstall of Windows 10 fixed that -- with all the sleep options turned off during that reinstall, of course, so it didn't go to sleep or into hibernation while reinstalling -- but I do still get times when the brightness and color on my display settings won't stick. It happens off and on, and always on bootup if it DOES happen -- the laptop will boot up and after all icons load on the task bar, it brightens up by a noticeable amount. The color is very washed out even after a lot of tweaking, and I'm going to have to do more work to try to figure that particular problem out. After two tries because the laptop was locking up, the setup process finally worked, but the process was clumsy and irritating, partly because the scroll didn't work on setup, partly because a lot of the things you have to input just simply didn't take. During setup, Microsoft wanted to verify my identity so they sent a code to my phone number, but the code that I was sent didn't work. I clicked the option to send a second code and it didn't go through, locking up the entire process. I went back about 10 screens and started again and this time it worked. However, the setup process was an enormous waste of time. Note that during setup, you have to click to read both the privacy statement and the terms before it'll let you click next. It was easy enough to make changes to the privacy settings once the laptop was finally up and working. There are several good articles out there (I recommend \"How to reclaim your privacy in Windows 10\" on PC World, but there are tons of others) and getting to the settings is pretty easy with Cortana's ask me anything bar. I have Cortana turned off as much as possible, but find the search bar very handy. DVD playback is very nice. I use VLC free download to play movies with good results. Sound from the speakers isn't great, it can be pretty tinny, but with bluetooth headphones it sounds really good. Battery life is good -- I haven't gotten 12 hours, but can go seven with nearly constant use. I installed Mozilla Firefox and it's working well, no problems so far. Sometimes Edge wants to come up as a browser when I do a search for something on the Cortana search bar, even though Firefox is supposed to be my default, but that's not a dealbreaker for me. Overall, the laptop is nice enough. The occasional lockup is giving me an ulcer, but when I look at reviews and comments for other laptops at a slightly higher price point, I figure this is the best laptop I'm going to get for a low price. If you're looking for something for school or work or more heavy duty usage, I would go with a better quality laptop, however.  I may have decided to keep this unit, but I wouldn't trust it for anything really important."}, {"name": "Jim Wright", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "April 15, 2019", "title": "Get the SSD version (or swap in your own) for best results", "review_text": "Summary: If you stick to the default configuration - 6GB RAM, 1TB spinning drive - you are likely to get frustrated with this laptop (2.5-3 stars). It can be very responsive at times, but for the first several minutes after every boot it is painfully slow, with the hard drive pegged at 100% usage. Replacing the hard drive with an SSD or M.2 SSD will make it feel like a completely different laptop (4+ stars), with few of the bottlenecks. As long as you're not gaming heavily or editing video, it's a solid performer - on par with my aging Core i7-3770 desktop. Details: My E15 arrived the night we left on vacation, so I didn't have time to upgrade the hardware; we spent a week with its default spinning (5400rpm) drive and 6GB RAM. After years of relying on SSD drives, returning to a spinning hard drive was painful. Every restart meant 5+ minutes of 100% hard drive activity and the system effectively unusable. After the drive activity caught up, the laptop could feel pretty peppy at times, but involve the hard drive again and it's back to seconds-to-minutes of paralysis.  The first couple of days were the worst, as the months of Windows and application updates worked to catch up. As soon as we returned home, I ordered an M.2 2280 SATA (WD Blue 500GB) for same-day delivery, along with a 16GB RAM upgrade kit (Crucial DDR3L-1600 2x8GB). I'd saved about $150 on he original purchase with gift cards and credit rewards points, so my personal cost of the laptop plus upgrades was still under $400. Replacing the RAM took less than a minute. The M.2 was a bit trickier to screw into place - tiny screw, fat fingers, older eyes - but once it was secured the fresh Windows install went smoothly with a bootable Windows 10 USB. (Tip: you will need to change the BIOS boot to Legacy mode and remove the existing drive, and you'll want to change the boot order so the SSD is at or near the top.) Note that if you have an old 2.5\" SSD lying around, chances are it will also work as a replacement. I tried with an old 120GB drive I pulled out of a desktop machine and it booted almost instantly; it just needed to install missing drivers and OS updates. The M.2 is likely going to be a bit faster, but not that much--and it's hard to beat free. You would need to activate with a different windows key, though, where on the fresh install it was activated for me. Once Windows was installed on the SSD, the machine powers up or restarts to a Ready state in seconds rather than minutes. Apps load quickly and some near-instantaneously; lag is minimal for most productivity apps. Pros: Disk and RAM are a quick and easy upgraded for a much better experience. USB-C is a nice addition; can recharge a USB-C phone  on battery or plugged in. Keyboard is decent to type on. 1080p screen. Speakers are loud. 802.11ac networking. DVD player. Cons: Poor performance with default spinning drive. Lots of bloatware. Webcam not that great. Screen has a narrow ideal range; veer too far from front-and-center and quality plummets. No backlit keyboard or cues when numlock, capslock, and scrolllock are active. Heavy. Plastic feels lower quality and attracts fingerprint smudges, though the design is attractive. Won't keep up with modern games. Power brick is ungainly."}, {"name": "The Re-Evaluater", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "April 25, 2019", "title": "Better than expected!

This causes it to be so slow it is unusable. I have built a couple of computers previously, work as an IT Consultant, and generally am decently technologically savvy when it comes to computers. The specs on this computer seemed pretty decent for the price, but the performance is terrible. None of the 100% disk usage fixes worked. The computer sits at 100% disk usage, possibly dropping down to 99% disk usage, before jumping back up to 100%. This occurs even if the only application open is Task Manager to monitor the disk usage.  I have had 4 different computers, 3 of them laptops, running windows 10 before and never run into this issue. After doing some research, it looks like this isn't an unheard of issue with multiple guides and reddits discussing the problem. I tried everything I could find, from disabling the WPR system collector, turning off windows search, turning off superfetch, running Check Disk, resetting the virtual memory, etc. No solutions worked. I contacted Acer feeling defeated I was unable to fix it. My thought was that it was probably a hardware issue at this point. Acer wanted me to run through all the same fixes, so I did. Then they wanted me to create a windows boot drive and try with a fresh, clean install. I did that too, without success. When I contacted them again, they wanted me to ship the computer to them to fix. Unfortunately the shipping cost isn't included. At this point I've been trying to get this computer working like it should have out of the box for several months. I'll have to pay more for them to potentially fix it. I think it would make more sense to just invest in a ssd upgrade for it and see if that solves the issue, since it seems to be solely the hard drive that is failing. If that works I'll probably skip the repair time/costs. Haven't had a good experience with this computer. Out of the gate if you just buy a ssd that might be a better experience for you.

Now, I only used one of these and I removed the 2gb stick. I use AIDA-64 to read motherboard specs in windows and it won't show if the ram is in dual channel since the timings from this stick are different from the original 4gb stick still in there but the performance assures me it most likely is dual channel. A few issues and very strange at that include: I attempted to install windows 10 pro and it won't activate, even though the home version I installed first, with the supplied hdd, supposedly activated windows 10 with a digital license. This means that the windows key that activated the operating system is supposed to be tied to the non volatile memory on the mother. In essence, any time windows 10 is installed in the future, no matter the key used, window will recognize the motherboard and know it should activate the OS. It does not do this in any fashion when installing PRO, Pro wont activate. I don't really care though as my only use for this laptop is SERATO! The battery was dead on arrival. I mean no juice what so ever and the charger is not Acer brand. I Was forced to plug in to get it started. I think I'm ok with this off brand charger. I've used plenty over the years and they all seem to be fine. The fact that the laptop is cheap means you need to do those upgrades.

And spring for a m.2 ssd drive at the same time you get this laptop too (see below) - if you can, wait for the September (back to school) or November/December sales when prices drop on all that stuff plus this laptop itself.  GET THE M.2. SSD DRIVE NOT A \"NORMAL\" SSD DRIVE .. that is you want the SSD drive that looks like a \"stick\" , that way you can still use the hard drive  that originally came with the laptop for additional hard drive storage space for your files or whatever... if you get the \"non-stick\" (non m.2.) version of an SSD drive  that will force you into replacing the \"normal\" hard drive from your laptop and you lose out on that money-wise (besides which you'll be happy with the m.2 drive far as it's speed and it's really not that expensive compared to a \"normal\" ssd drive, at least as far as the adata brand). I'll start out by saying you should read Louie's super helpful review (look for the one he posted July 17th 2018) ... helped me a lot though I took a slightly different approach than he did but I'm sure his approach works fine too :) .. in my case I used ... well it used to be called the msconfig command in the old days, now I think you just use task manager, go to startup and disable the programs you don't need to automatically start up when the laptop does (you'll  have to do some research on google if you're not familiar with them but it's pretty easy to figure out if you do the work) to further boost the laptop's speed. In my case I just googled  \"youtube, acer aspire e15 install m.2 ssd drive\" to find a youtube video called Aspire E15 How to Install an M.2 SSD Drive  (put out by acer themselves the manufacturer) which outlines how to  basically create media (you'll need a 16 GB or bigger usb drive I found usb 2.0 speed works fine but if you're not cheap like me I'm guessing usb 3.0 speed would be faster) you use to reinstall Windows if necessary .. the video also describes step by step everything you need to do on the hardware and software side to get that m.2 ssd drive  up and running on your laptop. Upgrading the memory/RAM.. eh, you could if you wanted to but I find the m.2 ssd drive makes the laptop plenty fast enough for our purposes (do stuff on the internet, watch videos, microsoft word documents ) even if you just leave the 6 GB of memory as is... let's face it, this is not a gaming laptop so I would seriously question the need for more memory than what's already installed if you install that m.2 ssd drive. I followed Louie's advice as far as the ADATA SU800 M.2 2280 m.2 ssd drive except I sprung for the 512 GB sized one instead (model number ASU800NS38-512GT-C just do a search using that on amazon) and very happy with it so far works great :)  (though I know people who swear by using HP  brand drives only so up to you I guess but can state with certainty the adata works no problem with this laptop)... I have to disagree with other reviewers who say the screw you need to remove from the laptop to install the m.2 ssd drive is easy..  not sure if the factory machines were overly enthusiastic when assembling this laptop but I literally had to clamp onto that screw with a pair of pliers, clench and turn just to get the darn screw off (and yes I was using the \"correct\" screwdriver for it so not sure what was going on there)... of course the screw would not go back into place either once I had the ssd drive in there... fortunately for me the \"hatch\" you unscrew on the back of the laptop to get access to the memory and hard drives has three screws - one of those worked just fine to secure the ssd drive in place so I swapped that with the SSD drive screw which is now the \"middle\" of the three screws securing that \"hatch\" in place on the laptop shell/cover.  But that was annoying, wasted a good 30 minutes struggling with that stupid ssd screw before finally giving up on it. Of course I kept the hard drive that originally came with the laptop too and made sure that got reinstalled into the laptop when I got the ssd drive  up and running .. while 512 GB of storage on the SSD drive  should be plenty for my purposes it's nice having that 1 TB  (original hard drive) of space for documents when and if I start to run out of room on the SSD drive... as well, the 1 TB of hard drive is a handy destination point for the Acronis backups I mentioned previously.  I've found Acronis to be kind of weird although maybe I'm just not using it correctly.. sometimes it will let me save a backup of the \" C \" drive  onto the same C drive, other times it insists the backup MUST be on a different drive  than the C drive... quite honestly it's a good idea to put your backup on a different drive than the C drive anyways in case the C drive gets totally wrecked...  if you followed my advice  and installed that m.2 ssd drive that problem is already taken care of... just tell Acronis to backup your C drive (which is now the m.2. ssd drive) onto the other drive (the 1 TB drive that originally came with the laptop) and you're good to go.  Do that maybe  once a month to keep your backups current  or if you like just let Acronis routinely backup your stuff by itself (though doing that will slow down your laptop - by how much I don't know since I just program a reminder in Microsoft Outlook to backup all the PC's in the house with Acronis once per month to avoid slowing down any of my PC's).  I found the backup of the C drive contents using Acronis to be very fast. I would also sign up for alerts for Norton Security  (or whatever antivirus/firewall program you prefer though I've had great success with Norton over  the years - helpful hint, check with your internet service provider, if you didn't know this already it's possible they will give you antivirus/firewall protection free of charge for your PC's as part of the service you're already paying for)  through bfads or slickdeals .. it's nice that the laptop comes with a trial version of Norton installed but once that runs out the last thing you want to do is pay full price for Norton like it will prompt you to do, look for a discounted  price on Norton instead (or even better yet free if your internet service provider will  do that for you). I suppose if you're okay with slow computers you could just use the computer as is without the m.2. ssd drive upgrade but I wouldn't recommend it.. I've been spoiled by the SSD drive experience  with my desktop computers and find non-ssd drive  computers to be painfully slow.. the upgrade really isn't that expensive nor is the install  all that difficult and you will  see a vast improvement in the laptop's performance. If you want to be extra safe, get yourself a usb 3.0 thumb drive and plug that into one of the blue colored usb 3.0 slots on the laptop... every time you generate an important file back it up onto that thumb drive.  Of course when you run the Acronis backup each month you can then \"clean out\" the usb 3.0 thumb drive (delete the files) since you just backed  up those files, but it's a nice little extra feature to preserve those important files.. or just take advantage of google's free drive storage and upload  the files to there until you can do your next Acronis backup.  Alternately just store your documents on that 1 TB hard drive that came with the laptop originally but then you have to have a way to backup those files to be on the safe side (maybe the usb 3.0 thumb drive)... I'm a fan of samsung's fit drives due to their small shape - I found the hard way the big thumb  drives have a nasty habit of breaking off inside the usb slot if your computer drops or gets moved the wrong way, small thumb drives aren't as likely to break since they're not sticking so far out of your PC (helpful hint - see if the older model of the samsung fit 3.0 thumb  drives is selling, practically the same performance  and much cheaper) I would strongly recommend a good laptop cooler for any laptop (their number one enemy is the hard drive in it overheating over  the years) - I've had great success with the Deepcool N8 or N7 model laptops due to their solid construction and the sheer amount of aluminum used in it which allows it to act as a great heatsink even without the fans running (heavy and somewhat sharp corners but worth it in my opinion)... note that you'll want to plug any laptop cooler into the right side of the laptop so that when you turn the laptop off the fans on the laptop turn off too ... if you plug the laptop cooler into the usb ports on the left side the fans will continue to run off the laptop's power  even when the laptop is turned off which is bad (fans will stop working if you run them non-stop day and night like that)... something to do with the hubs on the left providing power to usb devices and the hub on the right not so much. Overall very happy with this laptop especially given the price paid for it .. not good for a gamer but great for a college student or home user looking for a budget laptop for day-to-day or school needs (unless you're a video game or graphic designer or something who needs a high powered device - in which case you're probably looking for a more expensive laptop and not even reading this review anyways :P ) .."}, {"name": "Lex", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "November 12, 2019", "title": "The laptop is defective.", "review_text": "Do not buy this laptop.

Anyway, I was frustrated with the slowness of it.  I also had issues with the battery.  It says right on the labtop 12 hours battery power.  Well it would not give me more than say 3.75 hours when I clicked on the bottom battery icon.  So I charged it more over night.  Got up and checked it out.  It gave me 4.75 approx hours.  I fiddled around with batter power settings and finally called them.  We went thru a lengthy process of resetting the battery.  At the end he told me that I just have to time the battery myself.  See if it stays on the twelve hours despite what the icon says on the bottom of the screen.  Ok, just great.  Also had an issue with screen size shrinking.  You know its fine them wamb, you touch the touch key pad and it shrinks your page down to tiny itsy bitsy can't read?  You have no clue why.  Well he showed me what to do.  You go to the upper right and click on the setting icon, top of page.  Mine is three lines.  Search for zoom and put it on 100 or whatever you want.  What a pain, but atleast I know what to do.  I wanted to turn this option off.  He said that is not possible.  Don't care for that.  Pluses of the laptop.  Price is good.  The customer service was good, but he had a thick latino accent and I had to insist he slow down.  I could not understand a single word he said.  What's up with that?  He was nice thou, slowed down and we managed to get thru it all, but it was work trying to understand him.  Lots of \"what?\"  or \"I can't undrestand you.  Say it again.\"  Oh boy.....set up was pretty easy.  I'm still not sure about it to be honest.  I sure hope I don't end up sending it back.  That's my take thou."}, {"name": "Joel", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "December 9, 2018", "title": "A great laptop, a few minor drawbacks...", "review_text": "I have a pros/cons list at the bottom if you want to skip right to it. As a replacement for a Dell Inspiron 13 (a 2015 model that had been passed around on eBay), I was really excited to purchase this laptop. The aforementioned was showing its signs of wear and mishandling by multiple college students, myself included, and needed to be replaced before it fell apart completely. After being stuck on an awkward 1366x768 monitor, an FHD screen was first on the list. The screen is fine all things considered, but you have to be facing it head on or else the colors get affected by the backlight, my older laptop was the same but allowed much more freedom in viewing angles before the colors turned south. Much adjusting of the screen is required if you aren't sitting still with the laptop on a hard surface in front of you. Long battery life was something my old laptop did not have and came in at a mediocre six hours. The battery life on this webpage suggests 13.5 hours, but it shipped to me with a sticker in the upper right corner that said 12 hours. The sticker at the bottom of the keyboard says it's a proper 392H, perhaps the battery life sticker was a mistake (595 BM model anyone), or is the page here on Amazon misleading? Anyways, I have yet to entirely evaluate the battery life but I can say that it is a definitive step up. Plugging it in to charge it does require a bit of finesse and wiggling around but once you get it in, it's in. That 90-degree angle is a welcome addition over having the charging cord stick straight out. Storage options, previously I was just stuck with your regular SATA based storage in the form of either an HDD or an SSD, of which I previously opted for the latter. Reading that this laptop offers an M.2 slot I had felt it would be a great replacement for my M.2 which was replaced with an NVME drive in my desktop. I can't attest to the speed differences between the M.2 and SSD since they're both pretty much the same, both are silent, and that's about it. Sadly I can only have one storage option in this laptop at a time, can't go dual storage with a drive and an M.2. The 8th gen CPU is also a fair step up over my old laptop since it doesn't get anywhere as hot but then again that might be because this laptop has actual air intake vents in the bottom and a much larger exhaust fan. Dare I mention that the fan itself is also fairly quiet as well? It's certainly quieter than the heating vent under my bed when the furnace kicks on. The RAM is 6GB of DDR3... wait, 6GB? So I have to sell this stick and buy two 4GB sticks? Okay, I knew this going into it, but why such an odd choice? I've already had one memory related BSOD two weeks into usage, a particular BSOD I never had on the previous laptop (where I ran 8GB) which is alarming considering I've cut down on my multitasking. Don't get me wrong, I can work with 6GB, but why not offer a 4 or 8GB (4+4) version? The keyboard, this was one of the more subpar elements. For starters, the lack of a backlight makes your only light source at night with no lights on is the screen itself. I like considering myself a good touch typist but just seeing the keys and only needing to glance down to get your bearings instead of the tactile F/J bumps, it changes the experience for me in a way I don't like. The function keys are underused since the volume and backlight keys are represented by the arrow keys which in my mind is simply a bad practice. F1 and 2 are empty which could be used for brightness, while F9-11 are empty which could be used for volume and mute keys. The caps lock key does not have a visual indicator requiring you to type to see if it is engaged. The power button is a key in the upper right corner of the keyboard. I can't tell you how many times I've pressed this as I've grabbed the laptop to move it around. There appears to be a key to even bring up the right click menu in between the right alt and ctrl buttons. Isn't the touchpad enough? Speaking of the touchpad, it has a quirk to it. While the lower corners are their respective left and right click buttons the upper touchpad itself also doubles as buttons where the left half is left click, and vice versa. I haven't heard about this in any articles or anywhere on the Amazon page or comments section so maybe this is just a bug with my particular unit? All that aside, the keys themselves feel nice with a good amount of travel and an un-distracting noise. Given that the number pad is to the left, it will take a bit of adjustment to get used to, but so far this hasn't been an issue. The touchpad itself feels great, is responsive, and has a lovely accent for a border. The media inputs on the side are of acceptable quality featuring USB 3, C, and HDMI for all your modern computing needs. VGA I suppose is acceptable if you still use the port for projectors or to hook up to an older TV and... that is an ethernet port right? I thought those were fatter than this. The one thing that I don't really like was the CD/DVD drive. If you want to watch a movie on the plane, that's fine, but there are standalone disk drives that you can get for $15. Copy the disk as an mp4 and you're done, easy peasy. In the end, I feel like the CD/DVD drive would just be an unnecessary expense that was thrown on for the majority that will never use it to satisfy the minority who will all so ACER could pad the bottom line. Nothing against it, but why should we spend more? The speakers are bottom firing... *headdesk headdesk headdesk headdesk headdesk* My old laptop had thin side firing speakers which were, okayish, but these ones just... no... They deserve to be on the top. I mean, if the table was sentient and listening to the music, I guess it would be having a darn good time with that TrueHarmony, but tables do not listen to music. For what it is, the speakers are fine, but their placement is very questionable. The body of the laptop is, well what can I say, it's sturdy. Perhaps it was the thinness of the previous laptop but merely picking it up one-handed caused the frame to creak and bend. You don't get an iota of that with this. The laptop is textured in a way that is nice to the touch, although it's dark surface would expose fingerprints under the correct lighting. I haven't even accessed the BIOS yet, I should do that but I never get a prompt... If you don't know what this is, don't go looking. It's probably like that for a reason. Finally, the startup time is awesome. I recently purchased a Western Digitial M.2 NVME drive (WDS500G2X0C) and between pressing the power button to logged in is ~5 seconds. Now, for those of you that just want the quick and easy: Screen: + FHD - Poor viewing angles Battery: + Solid 12 - 13 hours Note: After testing I averaged about 9 hours based on my usage patterns. + 90-degree angle coming off the barrel plug + Doesn't heat up when charging Storage: + M.2 capiable (slient operation) - No option for dual SATA+M.2 CPU: + 8th gen does not heat up under moderate load or while watching videos + Adequate and quiet cooling solution RAM: +/- Single 6GB +/- DDR3 Keyboard+Touchpad - No backlight - Underused function keys (volume/brightness regulated to volume keys) - No caps lock indicator + Good key travel on pressing + Doesn't sound too loud + Touchpad and palm rest have a quality texture Note: A few bugs are mentioned at the end concerning the trackpad Inputs: + USB 3+C + HDMI +/- DVD/CD drive +/- VGA Speakers: +/- Acceptable quality - Downward firing Body: + Solid BIOS: ~ Unreviewed Startup Time (WD M.2 drive - WDS500G2X0C): + 5 seconds Looking back, it's a good laptop if you don't mind all the little problems, but to me, this is one that suffered a death by a million cuts. The base package is fine but all the little issues have really built up to make it a merely acceptable experience. Considering I got this on Black Friday, for $310 I'm not entirely let down but I still feel like this will be a laptop that ends up returned at the end of the day come late December or even January. Considering I still have a month and a half to change my mind, who knows, maybe I'll come around but I'm pretty sure my mind is made up on this. If you do not care for the little problems I have described above, it's a great value for under 400, a steal for under 325, anything less than 300 is simply highway robbery. Good play ACER, but I don't think this is for me. The ball is in your court. Edit - 1/27 ------------- Well after working out the laptops quirks I've decided that indeed, this isn't the laptop for me. The lack of a backlight for the keyboard is what hurts the most. I'd say that is then followed up by the viewing angles and speakers. The 6gb of RAM started becoming problematic, I'd strongly suggest replacing the second two gig stick with either a four gig one or removing it entirely. Finally, I don't know if it was said lack of ram or something to do with my touchpad, but I didn't experience this with either my previous laptop or the wireless mouse I use with my desktop... Sometimes while browsing I'd be scrolling down the page when the page would suddenly stop scrolling with the two-finger touch. No matter how much I scrolled, it wouldn't move. Since my cursor was still usable, this forced me to click and drag the scroll bar or switch to another window/program before scroll would start working again. The issue came and went early on, but in the last few weeks it's been very prominent and I don't understand why. I still have half a gig of RAM left over so I'm not bumping into that ceiling, and the CPU is only at an intermittent 40% load. Everything is fine when I use my wireless mouse which leads me to assume the fault lies with the trackpad. As I wrap up this review and shut down this laptop, I feel like the experience was a good one, but ultimately a laptop that suffered death by a thousand cuts like I mentioned in my original review.

So for the review part. First thing is when I first used after the setup it would run really slow until I found out that the Windows 10 automatic updates were making it slow until the updates were done it which is running faster now. So keep in mind that the Windows 10 automatic updating basically do updates everything in one shot which is too much as well it's best pause all Windows Store app updates and use the internet until it done or it'll slow down the Windows 10 update. Now for the laptop hardware function which has some small flaws. First is the volume and screen brightness controls which requires using the Fn button then use the control buttons that isn't too big of a deal but when comes changing the volume in a hurry when you're watching videos you sometimes come across parts where the sound is too loud where you have to turn down the volume in hurry but you to have push the Fn then the volume control which makes it inconvenient and annoying. The Caps Locks is another annoying because unlike most if all other laptops have a little light showing if the Caps Locks is on or off but this thing doesn't have it where it gets confusing if it's on or off until you memorize the pop icon on the screen that is the only to know if it's on or not. Another annoying thing is the touchpad part which doesn't have the left and right buttons like most standard laptops have which is bad if anyone has a difficult time with touchpads without the button parts it's best to planned ahead to get a mouse. The good if not the best thing about this laptop is the long battery life and the 1TB hard drive that is bit much memory for me as well the $350 was cheaper then most laptops that a includes DVD disc drive which is the only reasons why I haven't made it 3 stars or less."}, {"name": "Smiley1956", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "April 17, 2019", "title": "Accepts NVMe M.2 Drive", "review_text": "very happy with this for my travel and power outages computer first thing I did was make a recovery drive following the instructions (took about 1 hour 15 minutes to make the drive) then put in an NVMe M.2 drive ( yes it can use an NVMe drive) and used recovery drive to set it up and booted to it much faster than with 5400RPM spinner boot times average 13 seconds used Crystal disk mark 6 to test speed and sequential speed are 1056.0 read 403.7 write.

I've used this stupid thing wireless 6 or 7 times and the battery is now DOA.  I don't know how they can claim with a straight face that you can get 12 or 13 hours out of their battery, when I only got 4 hours, when it I hooked it up in December 2018.  At the end of February, 2019, I needed a new battery.  The batteries are junk and these computers are JUST TOO CHEAP.  put out a hundred more bucks and buy something decent!!! The computer is selling much higher, than I bought it for a couple weeks ago and I'd certainly never pay what they're charging for it now.  Wish I'd thrown in a hundred more bucks and got something decent, but ewwww all the great reviews.  Yeah, right!!  I've had this thing a WEEK and a HALF and I had my last laptop NINE years with less problems than I've had with this thing.  I'll upgrade it and do everything I can to make it better.  Don't believe the reviews, this is a bottom of the line computer.  Pay extra and get something better or expect to do a lot to make it a better machine.  Yes, I knew it was a cheap computer.  Just not that cheap.  I'm not going to get into anything technical, because you can read that elsewhere.  I'll just tell you some of the problems.  (Trust me, there are More.) First off, it claims this is a \"12 HOUR BATTERY\"  Yes, I had it fully charged.  I was on it 4 hours and 13 minutes and the warning just came on that the battery was \"Running low and to find another power source.\"  WHAT???  The laptop is only 1 1/2 weeks old!! 4 1/2 Hours is nowhere close to 12 hours, as they tout.  This is while running an incredibly Dim Screen. I thought I'd like the Long Battery Life, but didn't like the fact that as soon as it goes to wireless, the screen brightness cuts in Half, without my permission or resetting it.  The computer decides for itself to do that.  It should have let ME make that decision, when cutting the resolution that drastically.  I don't like that.  I thought that the long battery life would make it more convenient to recharge my phone, on the go, when no ac outlet where available.  As it turns out, that LONG battery life, is NOT what they claim. MY BIGGEST BEEF SO FAR One thing I really don't like is the LAN port on the computer.  It's HORRIBLE.  Be prepared to replace a LOT of cables, so buy them CHEAP.  The reason, is because this laptop, like some others on the market, doesn't have a \"Normal Port.\"  You have to angle your connector to get it in and work a stiff opening up, with your connector.  .  The opening is half the normal size.  I used my laptop wireless exactly THREE times and my connector BROKE.  I had another new one on hand, so I used it.  After the second time going wireless with the laptop, the connector end, going into the computer became so loose that it started FALLING OUT, if you barely touched it.  ARGH!!  IT astonishes me why people aren't mentioning this.  After I called the toll free number, Acer told me how to do it and I was doing it right.  Really?  I wish I wasn't, because I don't relish having to buy a 10 pack of 6 foot cables.  Trust me, I'll be buying cheap ones and searching for closeouts.  This is my biggest beef on this computer, because a laptop is basically made to be used wireless a good deal of the time.  That means connecting & disconnecting and they should have taken that into account, when making the one and only LAN port.  Plus, it's so hard to do, forget about doing it in dim light, you can't even feel the stupid thing.  You have to turn the lights on to hook your laptop back up.  I've always just been able to plug it back it, because it was easily found.  NOPE!!  Not now.  You better turn on the lights and TRY to find it.  Then work it in just right and hope you don't break off or wear out another cable connector.  CRAP!!!  Oh yeah, that's fun. NOT A PROBLEM WITH THIS COMPUTER-BUT A MICROSOFT - SOFTWARE PROBLEM Before purchasing this laptop, I bought a Dell from Wal-Mart.  I was setting it up and got to the point, where you have to put your Country & Birthdate.  I put in United States and it wouldn't let me enter my birthdate.  Whenever I tried, it would erase it, before I could click on NEXT.  I could not continue with set up.  After trying all kinds of birthdates and everything I could think of, I called Dell customer support.  I talked to 2 separate techs for the better part of an hour.  They told me to return it to Walmart or mail it in to them and it might be a few weeks, before I'd get it back.  I wasn't about to mail in a brand new computer for repairs. Fast forward a couple days and I purchased this computer on Amazon.  Guess what?  I got to the EXACT same place and I could NOT input my birthdate or any birthdate.  I called the toll free number included in the box for Amazon/Acer Support.  After about 35 to 40 minutes of them trying everything, they agreed with me that this was a software issue and gave me Microsoft's phone number.  GAWD, if someone would have just done that to start with.  Called Microsoft and found out \"YUP\" it's in a LOT of computers.  She walked me through it and we set up the computer completely through Microsoft  I was probably on the phone with her about 50 minutes, but Hallelujah, everything was working and off & running.  Thank you Microsoft Lady!!! A COUPLE OTHER THINGS A touch screen would have been great, but this is a lower priced laptop, so I wasn't expecting one.  Since it's a 15.6\", it totes a full layout keyboard.  OK, I know a lot of people like the little 10\" & 14\" models, but I want at least a 15.6\" laptop.  Sure, I'd even like a 17\", but then you're jumping in price again. The trackpad isn't overly responsive, but I don't really use a trackpad much anyway. A backlit keyboard would REALLY be nice and my next laptop will definitely have that.  Again, not something usually found on a lower priced laptop. So, my Biggest Beefs are the \"Battery Does NOT Last Anywhere Near What Acer Claims.\"  \"The LAN Port is a JOKE.\"  \"Can't Blame Acer for the Software, that's on Microsoft-SHAME On YOU-Microsoft.\"  FIX THAT!!!  Acer is also not responsible for the problems with Windows 10.  \"Ahem-Microsoft?\"  Windows 10 has been around long enough, for these things to have been fixed.  Why aren't they?  Why do the buyers have to go in and fix everything? My advice is to go with another computer.  If you do purchase this, get it on sale, because you're going to have your share of headaches and you should at least save a few bucks.

You cannot easily use all three ports at the same time, usually I can only use 2 out of 3 as these three ports are right next to each other and way too close. My HDMI plug is too wide and blocks me from using the USB port next to it. Since 2 of the USB ports are also right next to each other you can only use very slim adapters, such as a charger cables, you will have some difficulty with some USB drives as they're too wide.

If you are even a little tech savvy, it is quite simple to upgrade this $400 laptop into one that can keep up with one triple the price. Just follow the below steps: 1. Get an M.2 SSD (Conveniently offered as a bundle) 2. Take off the battery, then the bottom plate and insert the SSD in the M.2 slot (look up a guide on YouTube if you need a demo, it's quite simple to add). Replace the plate and battery. 3. Turn on the laptop and go to Microsoft's website and follow the instructions to create a Windows 10 bootable USB. (This is a good preview of how the laptop would be without an SSD that will make you appreciate it all the more) 4. Once your USB is ready, shut down the machine, insert the USB in the 3.0 port and turn it back on. 5. Reinstall Windows 10 on the SSD, and format the old HDD. If it doesn't boot to the USB installer, you may need to restart and press the F12 (I think) key while it is powering on to get to the boot menu, and choose the USB to boot from. Voila! You now have a bloatware-free, 5-seconds-to-boot Windows 10 laptop with 1TB of additional storage that should run very well for the price.

The lack of backlighting on the keyboard is one of those things I didn\u2019t expect to miss until I tried to use my laptop at night. It\u2019s actually a bit annoying but it\u2019s part of the sacrifice at this price point. Lastly the plastic is fingerprint city. Any time I touch the computer a fingerprint appears and maybe it\u2019s because I spend a lot of time working on cars but I tend to not keep my hands very oily, and yet as you can see by my photo the prints are really bad leading me to wipe it down at least twice a day.

The construction is not particularly rugged, but as long as you pick it up with both hands, never by the screen, and use a cushioned backpack when transporting it, you should be fine.

You will absolutely want to add an additional 4GB of ram - it will make a tremendous difference in performance across the range. The second is the power adapter. It is the cheapest adapter Acer could have paired with it. It can struggle to both run the laptop and charge the battery at the same time, and there are high failure rates. This is true whether you have the Acer branded adapter or the Lite-On branded adapter.

I have only been using it about 10 days now but so far so good. I am new to Windows 10 and can't say I'm a huge fan but I know I will get used to it with time.  I love having the DVD-R drive. These are increasingly hard to find on laptops. Video on this Acer is sharp and sound is nice and clear from the speakers. The colors and \"themes\" are nice as well. I like that I can customize colors, etc. Battery life is good as well. I don't like that the number keypad cuts itself off every time I restart the computer or close the lid. There may be a way to change that in the settings. I am still learning new things each time I'm on the laptop. Will update this review after more time has passed."}]},

It is a little heavy to be used one handed, but it's large enough to brace against your body. I've gotten more arm strain from much smaller lighter devices. As a laptop the keyboard is well sized and easy to type on. All the keys are well placed. My only complaint is that there is no 10 key on the side, but with this size that wouldn't be possible. Battery life is decent, probably 4-8 hours. It multitasks well, I've watched videos with multitab chrome running in the background. Speaking of chrome, it runs great until you get about 12-15 tabs up. Then it get's a little slooooow. The touch screen is as responsive and a flagship smart phone.

I don't often write reviews but upon reading some of the negative ones on this particular product, I was inspired to leave one. First off, a lot of people are complaining about the limited app store that you are forced to utilize while in Windows S mode. However it's super easy to change to regular Windows. The first thing I do immediately when using a new computer is download Chrome. With this computer, I just had to go through the motions of downloading Chrome, it told me I couldn't while in S mode and asked if I wanted to switch, I clicked \"yes\" and boom, regular Windows, no problem. It is correct that there are no regular old USB ports on this. However, I bought a $6 adapter and it's no big deal. I don't plug too many USB things into it anyway (it has bluetooth, so you can easily get a bluetooth mouse and bluetooth headphones), but the adapter is so cheap that I picked it up anyway just in case I ever should need it for a flash drive or whatnot. Some people talk about a pen. I'm not sure why. Mine did not come with a pen. But that wasn't a big deal either. I was able to get a Microsoft certified pen for $30 on Amazon that works perfectly with it (not a stylus, a true connective pen). The lack of a slot for a pen is a little inconvenient, but I purchased a pen clip that attaches to the side of the laptop (also very cheap) and problem solved. The processor could be better, it's a little laggy with too many Chrome tabs open, but for the price I can't complain. Overall, it needed a few tweaks (like the adapter, pen, and pen attachment) but it was worth it for the low price, lightweight machine, and great battery life. I've been a lifelong user of Asus products and while I have been disappointed in the more recent low reviews of their computers, I wasn't able to stray away to a different company, and once again I am not disappointed."}, {"name": "Daniel H.", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "October 31, 2019", "title": "STEER CLEAR OF \"RENEWED\" UNITS", "review_text": "I purchased a computer and found that it has apparently had the Windows 10  \"key\" already used.

But any of us accustomed to the micro-SD slot on other tablets (including modern Kindle Fire tablets) or phones will be shocked at how awful the \"card reader\" slot on this device.  It appears as if the designers NEVER want a memory card left in the slot for longer than it takes to upload or download a few files. First designer / user mis-match, the SD slot takes the old-style full size (postage stamp sized) SD Card.  I would have (and think most users would) expect the micro-SD (fingernail sized) card. Second, the full sized card only inserts into the slot about 1/4th its length.  It leaves about an inch of plastic waving around outside the edge of the device -- catching on clothing, other paperwork, etc.  Obviously the card can't be left in the slot when the tablet is put away in a sleeve for transport; it would break right off, probably damaging the slot. Third, the card doesn't ever \"catch\" or hook into any sort of spring-like mechanism.  Most tablets do have a sort of tactile \"feel\" when the card seats into the slot correctly, and the catch also holds the card from getting unseated when the device is shaken.  Some devices with the full sized SD Card slot even have a rubberized cover over the opening.  This tablet takes a card, partway in, and you can push as hard as you dare without ever knowing whether it's engaged properly or not -- and you can tug it out accidentally with no indication you're doing so. Fourth, it's just annoying that all the other slots are micro modern.  HDMI, USB, etc.  All micro.  Why the inconsistancy/ Fifth, the slot is rated to take VERY LARGE  SD memory cards -- the kind I expected to use as sort of a \"hard drive\" to store the photos the tablet would be recording and editing.  This is inconsistent with the \"Card Reader\" description and the bad mounting design that seems to suggest the designers only wanted users to move a few files from separate camera, into the VERY SMALL on-board memory, then remove the SD card.  With this SD card slot out of the picture, there is no way to upgrade user-storage capacity, as with a hard drive or on-board SSD drive.  So, why bother installing and rating for large capacity SD cards?  Misleading. I'm not particularly thrilled with the \"Windows 10 (R)estricted  Operating system, either. Yes, it's a fine touchscreen. Very light weight.  Seems to hold a charge on the battery.  But  NOT what I needed or wanted or expected.

Just a heads-up before buying this though. It does not have old style USB Type A connections on it. You will need an adapter, hub, or just buy new peripherals with a USB Type C connector.

I really love how lightweight the computer is and the size is just perfect.

I didn't think I would use the tablet function much on this computer but after testing it out today I may have to play around with it more. I saw several negative reviews about this machine and I don't see why, other than perhaps those people just got a bad egg. I would most definitely recommend this computer to students and anyone who needs a lightweight computer on the go or something easy for personal use.

It's fast enough to handle normal internet browsing, and of course any office/ school work, its touch screen is great and useful, and it's nice, light, and sleek. the one thing that could be better is the pen. if you're drawing with it you may have difficulties. It regularly will think the pen is not touching the screen for a fraction of a second, so if you hit ctrl+z it will only remove part of what you drew, sometimes this makes gaps in lines aswell. you'll have to press harder than you might be comfortable with and i havent' see na way to increase pen sensitivity just through windows ink or through pen and touch settings. This laptop only has 2 USB ports, a C type and a microUSB type, so you will likely need an adapter. and the microUSB is upsidown for some reason, which is odd. lastly if the screen is free standing, AKA not stood upsidedown like the mail thumbnail or made to look like a tablet, the screen is a bit wobbly, which is fine for touch input, but not for the pen. Overall the cons sound worse than they are, this is a great laptop, it could just use some quality of life improvements aswell as a more functional pen Pros   affordable   plenty fast for academic/office work/lightweight drawing software   sleek and portable   touch screen works great   touch keyboard is very responsive   all around a good experience Cons   pen sensitivity could work better   only 2 USB ports, neither of which are the traditional USB-A type   you will probably need adapters   screen is a little wobbly when using pen in 2 of 4 (or more?) possible positions"}, {"name": "Lala", "rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "May 12, 2018", "title": "Terrible purchase.

I like to take my work to the coffee shops sometimes and had been using a tablet with bluetooth keyboard. While this worked fine, it was difficult to use apps like Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Illustrator, and In Design. This ASUS laptop allows me to use all of the apps I need to get the job done. The laptop was super easy to set up and it has been working flawlessly ever since. I was able to set up my emails, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Amazon Music, Amazon Video, Hulu, and Adobe CC accounts. The Intel Quad-Core Pentium N5000 processor, coupled with 4GB DDR4 memory is adequate enough to complete all of my coffee shop tasks. I\u2019m a graphic designer, so while I wouldn\u2019t rely on this as my work horse computer, it is great for what I use it for. There are 128GB of eMMC storage, which is plenty for most tasks, but if I\u2019m going through a session of uncut video, I\u2019ll just use my 1TB external drive to keep plenty of free space on the laptop. Lets talk for a moment about streaming video and music on this ASUS laptop. First of all, it streams perfectly. The computer is fast enough to easily handle streaming high quality video, of course that all depends on the available wifi connection, as with any computer or device. The sound quality on videos is excellent. I was actually surprised at how good it sounded. Listening to music, on the other hand, is just OK. I\u2019m not real sure why this is, but this laptops audio strong point is definitely movies. You can, of course, connect an external speaker or headphones as well. While this laptop does an excellent job at being a laptop, it sports another exciting feature as well. It has a touch screen! Let me say that again. IT HAS A TOUCH SCREEN! Hahahahaha The touch screen is awesome! I absolutely love it. It allows me to do fairly heavy work as a laptop, while still allowing the feel of a tablet when I want it. The screen actually folds back completely, transforming the laptop into a tablet. You can also position the screen in any position between closed and fully folded against the back of the laptop. Pretty cool! I enjoy using the drawing app, though it\u2019s not the best for creating stunningly realistic paintings. It is still a lot of fun and serves its purpose. There are a few apps included with this ASUS laptop, like an Office 365 trial. I\u2019m a bit disappointed that you have to pay for an Office subscription to keep using it though. I chose to search a free option and found a couple in the windows store that were very similar to Word and Excel. I\u2019m actually writing this review using the free software I installed. This ASUS laptop is also able to perform tasks like video chat through Skype, which is also included with the laptop, and free for other devices. While the laptops built in camera is only a VGA UVC Webcam, it does a fine job for Skypeing. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for glamour shots though. Lol The audio also does well with Skype. I was able to clearly hear my wife\u2019s voice and understand everything she said. This IS a laptop, so there is bound to be a touch pad. While I did accidentally bump it with my thumb a few times while typing (not at all the fault of the laptop), it worked really well while intentionally using it. It is basically a flat rectangle with a small printed line at the bottom, separating left and right mouse clickable areas. The track pad is smooth and didn\u2019t appear to have any glitchy spots. Clicking was nice and crisp. It worked perfectly. Overall this is an excellent little laptop that is able to stream video, stream music, web surf, email, video call, and run programs like Adobe Photoshop. I am very pleased and so far the laptop has performed perfectly with plenty of speed. I can\u2019t really say how long the battery lasts yet, but I am surprised I haven\u2019t had to recharge it yet. I charged it completely when I took it out the box and have been using on and off for a couple of weeks now. I\u2019m very happy and would highly recommend this laptop.

On the pro side, once I had it set up, I like the speed and responsiveness.  It isn't loaded with bloat.  The touch screen and flip keyboard makes it easy to use and flexible.  The display is nice and crisp. so from a purely functioning perspective this is a good computer But on the con side there are some things that kinda aggravated me: For one, I hate having to be tied to to an email account in order to log in.  It would not allow me past the set up unless I used a microsoft account.  Yes, you can go in after set up to allow signing on with just a local, non-email connected account but I dislike having to do it from the start.  Also no matter what, it would not recognize my professional office 365 account.  So I had to use a fall back old hotmail account. This leads to my other issue is that it runs widows10  home s which only allows downloads from the microsoft store.  So if a program or app is not in the MS store, you can't use it on this machine.  Through my employer I am allowed to download the full Microsoft 365 office suite of products to my personal computer, the desktop versions.  Except Windows 10 Home S does not allow that.  I had to find a contortionate way to finally activate my  office products (because remember it would not recognize my professional MS account during set up). So i get that this is more secure etc. etc. but is leads to some frustration and results in the loss of some autonomy. A work around is to download the Windows 10 regular Home or Pro.  I opted not to for now, but if I find that I am having issues downloading programs then I may go that route."}, {"name": "H.

It's so lightweight and slim that it is especially portable. The touchscreen is nice and the 360 degrees of folding make it an excellent, versatile laptop that can turn tablet. There is no usb-a port. It does have micro usb and usb-c ports and a SD card slot. There is a headphone jack and screen brightness is also on the side which is odd but doesn't bother me. The battery life it pretty darn good but didn't blow my mind. I suppose for being so slim the battery life really is pretty good. The speed is good and so far I've had zero hiccups or struggles with any software or use. The price point is especially good for this style of laptop, in my opinion. It would be an excellent choice for anyone with a decent basic, portable laptop or especially a student. This laptop also stays impressively cool. There are not hot areas even after an hour of use.

I was extremely unsure about a chromebook. I went back and forth with myself for weeks. But let me say this, if you're an android lover, this chromebook will come as a second nature. It's based off the Google play store, and some of the features are great! (Like, if you have your phone unlocked nearby, you do not have to input a password to your computer.) Biggest selling points was the screen size. Most of the chromebooks I found are much smaller and this has a HUGE screen with such beautiful quality. The display settings also offer a night light/blue light filter which I absolutely LOVE about it! Battery life is great and just all around great computer.

I also found connecting to my HP printer was much easier than the process to connect on my Mac. For me to transition from a Mac to the Chromebook was very smooth. This screen is so much larger than my Mac and has taken some getting used to. At this price my husband has encouraged me to get a smaller one to carry when we go somewhere but I am adjusting to this larger size.  I thought the large size would be a viewing plus and it is. It's heavier than the small Mac and that is the adjustment. I use it for basics and work- banking, contracts, etc and I am very pleased!!! I will add that I never liked iPhones but did like my Mac Air but like the Chromebook much better so far."}, {"name": "Jarel", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "September 30, 2019", "title": "Seemingly Great Bargin", "review_text": "09-30-19 Just received these today so take this review in stride as I usually try and update my reviews every couple months on expensive purchases like these. I bought two of these, they came at a great price, and right NOW I'm loving them. For me the screen size and picture quality are great. No issues as others seemed to have with resolution. My kids (11 and 12) are familiar with them because they use similar devices at school. They're seemingly fast, efficient and user friendly. They came ready to use right out of the box and limited effort on my part needed to be exerted to place monitoring controls on them. 10-7-19 So, I haven't even had these products a week and one of the units wont turn on and will not hold a charge. I've contacted the customer support team (located in India i.e. thick accents) these individuals are extremely difficult to understand, talk fast, and I \"lost connection\" twice. Long story short I have to wait for a shipping label, go to a fed ex store, send it in for repairs and wait 7 to 10 business days for those repairs to be made. This unit is my daughter's so you can imagine how thrilled she'll be about all of this. 10-30-19 So, I went to the fed-ex store to ship these back. I had to purchase a special box for the chromebook, that cost $25, as shipping it in the box it came in and bubble wrap wouldn't protect it completely. It came back within the 7 to 10 business days as promised.....in a different box, upside down and wrapped in bubble wrap. Seriously?!?!??

I bought this with the full intention of hacking it through developer mode and doing a chroot Linux install, which runs alongside the boot OS and avoids by using the main OS to interface with devices. I wanted a client to play my Windows desktop and Shadow cloud PC at my girlfriend's and when I travel. So I installed moonlight and shadow on Linux. They both work beautifully and the Wi-Fi connection is rock solid. But I have come to realize the fact it is very nice to boot into Chrome OS instantly if I just want to surf the web or do basic Android apps (no hardware acceleration for that or the built-in Linux feature in the beta channel, which is one reason I did the chroot install, so don't plan on using that to game), initiate the Linux desktop if I want a multi-purpose full desktop experience, or if I want full-on gaming, connect to my PC or my Shadow Cloud PC and let it rip. Even when connected to my Shadow cloud PC, the battery life is still incredible. It doesn't get very warm. The Wi-Fi connection is rock solid. The screen has a narrow viewing angle but the picture quality is actually pretty good. The colors get a little bit deeper if you give yourself a few feet from the screen which is easy if you use a game controller to play a good number of your games. It was an incredible buy for $200 and got me what I need it to do without having to buy a Microsoft license or buy from one of those expensive custom Linux laptop companies."}, {"name": "J.

I have been looking for an MS alternative for a while as the issues and maintenance of a MS PC have grown old. I wanted an easy to use and maintain system that was inexpensive but still fast to boot up and use. The Chromebook fit all of those requirements nicely. The setup of this system was very easy and the interface isn't that different from an Android phone. It didn't take long at all to figure out where everything was located and so far the system has worked flawlessly. The battery life is great and the 15.6\" screen is the same size as the older laptop that it replaced. I was able to show my non-PC savvy wife how to use this system without any problems. The hardware is more than capable of running the Chrome OS and there are plenty of apps available to do just about anything that you could want to do. The only shortfall would be if you require a specific software that will only run on a MS PC then this system would not work for you. For the vast majority of users this system will work fine. I have a relative who purchased an expensive MacBook and this Chromebook is very comparable to that system at less than 1/3 of the cost.

And after my order arrived... well I got that high-end Chromebook, with good performance and build quality... for a Chromebook. For a product advertised with a metal build, it isn't wrong, but the only metal on the surface is the center plating around the keyboard and track pad. The top, bottom, and screen cover are made from a cheap polymer coated with silver paint. This is excusable since it's a Chromebook but I just wanted to point out that it isn't all metal. The I/O is fantastic, as it contains 2 USB C ports, 2 USB 3.0 ports, a microSD slot, headphone jack, and k-slot. It also charges through the USB C slot on the left side, which is just amazing. Performance-wise the device is remarkably better than any sub-500 dollar Chromebook I've ever used. It contains an SSD, so quick boot up times in the seconds were expected. The 4 GB of RAM hits a sweet spot in price/performance for light work and multi-tasking. And the 2.4 Ghz CPU was able to keep up with the tasks that I demanded it to accomplish. For media consumption, this device gets the job done. The screen is a 1080p (not sure if 60hz) IPS display with adequate color accuracy. For reading articles or looking at photos, the Chromebook does an excellent job. I can't exactly say the same for videos, however, as any video I've watched was defaulted to 720p. I can set it to 1080p but afterwards the device gets a little slow and toasty. At least 720p isn't an unwatchable resolution. On the notions of productivity, Chromebooks were designed to accomplish this at a low price point. The specs are just enough for light multi-tasking, as I was able to run Chrome (3 tabs), Firefox (2 tabs), Google Documents, Microsoft OneNote, and Discord all at the same time. While it's true that Windows or Macbooks are able to accomplish much more than this, those laptops exist at a different much higher price point. Macbooks don't exist new at this price point and the Windows laptops that do are often plagued with meager performance and build quality (basically it doesn't take a whole lot to run ChromeOS compared to Windows). Lots of good points to note but I do have some bad points to point out. First off, the track pad. The track pad is just garbage with poor sensitivity, poor tracking, and poor physical touch. The material on the track pad is glossy plastic and it lacks a matte texture, making it difficult to precisely maneuver the cursor as friction slows your finger down. ChromeOS also only has 5 cursor settings, making it difficult to precisely personalize the DPI. Due to this I had to buy a Bluetooth mouse. Another flaw would be the battery life; advertised as 14 hours, I actually only got 6 hours off at 50% brightness. 14 hours at 10% brightness is probably what Acer was referring to. Final flaw would be the keyboard. Typing on it isn't very grand; it can be argued that I should not expect a good typing experience from a 300 dollar Chromebook, but I felt better keyboards from other 300 dollar Windows laptops. Also I did read some third party reviews from other sites, apparently the Acer Chromebook 15 keyboard suffers from water and moisture problems. As such I would recommend Amazon's recommendation for the silicone Acer Chromebook keyboard cover. Overall I think this is a good productivity device for small business or schoolwork. It certainly punches above its price point while not breaking the bank. If you can deal with the flaws I listed above, I would highly recommend this over any other 300 dollar laptop."}, {"name": "Sapphire", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "August 30, 2019", "title": "My Fifth Acer 15 CB....Trust this 5-star Review, Please", "review_text": "Since 2014, I have purchased five Acer 15 Chromebooks from Amazon. These last two just within the past week. I am impressed with these and love the back-lit keyboard, a new feature for my collection. Wonderful. I can type in the dark when and if I need to. Also, it is an additional perk and aesthetically speaking, very attractive. Another fantastic feature for my needs is the ability to charge my CB from either side. The adapter inserts to the left or the right of this CB. When buying Chromebooks, I look for brilliant screen features that are most important to me and they are, Full HD with IPS technology and  also a must-have \"fabulous audio.\" I love the speakers located on either side of the keyboard and facing up. I love great bass in my music and all my Acer 15.6 Chromebooks brings it in spades. \"Almost\" as good as my separately purchased remote surround-sound system for my desktop PC and the best speakers on any CB I have listened to. The beautiful FULL HD screen display is glossy, not matte which I would have preferred and my 3 previous Acer 15 Chromebooks from 2014 and 2017 have.  I should have knocked down a star for this issue but the top CAN quickly be adjusted when the light behind me is being reflected so I didn't.  You do lose some screen brilliance when you have a matte screen ( anti-glare )  but I got used to it in no time. If you want a matte screen that doesn't reflect light the ACER 14 has that feature but you lose the back-lit keyboard. I am going to wait until the 2020 CBs are available as they have this feature ( matte ) plus a longer AUE date. ( Automatic Update Expiration )  That date begins when the device is manufactured not when you receive it. I have read all of the reviews of this model and agree with all  5-star ones.

I reset the chromebook to factory settings and restarted. After the setup I tried it again, still didnt work. I didnt want to get stuck with a broken chromebook off the bat so I sent it back for an exchange.

The SSD drive loads everything a lot faster than my PC.  True, it the hard drive is only 32GB, but I was able to add a 256GB MicroSD Card for storage. The manual doesn't mention a size limit for the SD card, so if 256GB isn't enough for your storage needs, you can go higher than that. After a bit of fidgeting, I figured out how to save files on the SD card instead of the internal hard drive or Google Drive.  Yes, the purchase of this Chromebook gives you an additional 100GB on Google Drive.  However, I'm old enough (in my 60's) that I don't trust the Cloud.  The default setting saves your files to the Cloud, but it's fairly simple to change that setting  Just click on the clock (lower right side of the screen) > the Settings wheel > Downloads.  You can either set it to save in a specific location every time or ask you where to save the file.  I chose the later, just because I have several different folders for downloading files.  Another thing I like is that there's an app that mimics MS Word, so I can save files from my PC to the Chromebook using Bluetooth. I use the File App (a blue circle with a picture of a file folder inside the circle) to open files and determine how much free space I have remaining on the hard drive, USB drives and my SD card.  You can also use the File App to create new folders (for instance, creating a new folder for every year in the Photo Folder, then creating a new folder for each month in each year's folder). The one thing that bothers me about the Chromebook is that I can't put icons for the various apps on the desktop (like I do on my PC -- I called Acer's tech support and asked).  I can put them at the bottom of the screen -- Chromebook calls it the Shelf.  There are two ways to add your favorite and most used icons on the Shelf: * Drag and drop, or * Right-click on the app with your mouse and click app icon, then click \"Pin to Shelf.\"  To find all your apps, click the small circle on the lower left of the screen, then click the caret (^).  All the apps you've got on the computer will show up there. The reason I don't like not being able to use the desktop to store my favorite icons is that I have more than will just fit in a single row on the Shelf.  I also don't care much for the keyboard, but that's because I prefer my keyboard to have more of an audible click to it.  It makes it easier for me to touch type.  However, I didn't ding the stars for that because I know other people will prefer a more silent keyboard, especially when there are other people in the room watching tv while you're computing. The battery life depends on how you're using the Chromebook.  When watching videos, it lasts about 6 hours.  If I've got the Chromebook in standby mode (like my PC going to sleep), it will last about 12 hours."}, {"name": "Steve H.", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "November 23, 2019", "title": "Easy to set up", "review_text": "So far so good easy to set up love the back lit keyboard"}, {"name": "Mitch Goergen", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "July 30, 2019", "title": "Chromebook simply works", "review_text": "Chromebooks make life easier.

So first off, of course it's WAY BETTER than my old laptop, so I won't compare it to that, I'll compare it to my relatively new work laptop which is an HP. I lifted this Acer laptop out of the box, it's fairly light, and plugged it in - and immediately the WELCOM page came up and then it was just a matter of following the prompts and logging into my Google account! I am not tech savvy AT ALL, so this was immediately reassuring. It will take me time to discover all the joys of this new laptop - I know I will love the touch-screen and I'll get used to the touch-pad \"tap\" instead of \"click\". Anyway, I feel I'm in the 21st Century for sure. And the PRICE! Well, it's half of what I paid for my old laptop 10 years ago!

I have had some time with the new Chromebook and I would like to share a few thoughts and experiences with this particular model. The first thing that I noticed with this Acer Chromebook was how thin and lightweight it was. It reminded me of a Macbook, though I have never owned one. I love the silver metal look and the keyboard is very enjoyable and comfortable to use. The speakers on either side of the keyboard are nice and sound amazing considering the size and the fact that they are housed in a very thin and compact space. Initially I did experience some issues with the screen where it would not turn on despite the fact that there was power. It was very random but about 80% of the time the display would not turn on. I was able to contact Acer and they did resolve the issue within a reasonable amount of time. I had to send it back to Acer and they replaced the mainboard which I assume was the culprit. As I type up this review I am doing so on the repaired Chromebook and I have to say that though I had that initial experience, Acer made it right and I absolutely love this product! I\u2019m not real savvy with the Chromebook OS but it really is simple and I appreciate the fact that this model comes with a Micro SD slot for my 128gb card which will come in handy to use for loading some movies and or music for on-the-go. Also it will come in handy for loading a few photos to edit with my favorite mobile photo editing app using the excellent touch screen which I quite enjoy. Speaking of movies I have played a bit with Netflix, Google Movies and Hulu and the video quality is quite amazing with the 1080p screen resolution and, as I mentioned earlier, the sound is surprisingly loud and clear. Battery life has been pretty impressive and lasts much better than I expected. As I stated before, this has been my first Chromebook experience so the only thing I have to compare battery life with is my much larger gaming laptop which I can't even get a few hours of use before I need to plug in. Overall this Acer Chromebook 15 has been quite enjoyable, and because of Acer\u2019s great support, I would highly recommend this Chromebook if you are looking for an inexpensive well rounded mobile \u201cLaptop\u201d experience."}, {"name": "New England Yankee", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "June 20, 2019", "title": "Acer is Excellent.  Chromebooks/Google g-suite have come into their own.", "review_text": "The original concept of the Chromebook was a technically lightweight internet/web appliance without the usage, knowledge, and maintenance complexity of typical home computers of the time.  Aimed at those with similarly lightweight needs like simple browsing and email, it was ahead of the curve on cloud-based apps and storage.  Way too far ahead, unfortunately, as Chromebooks barely survived their introduction.  Cloud functionality, availability, and pricing has come a long, long way since then, to the point where it\u2019s unusual to find someone who isn\u2019t using the cloud.  Moreover, Chrome itself has become one of the most widely-used browsers, Google apps (g-suite) incredibly popular and powerful, and the Chromium OS platform itself has become attractive as a deployment base.  Microsoft is even porting its Edge browser to Chromium.  So the ground has shifted from the Chromebook being the odd machine out to a very capable alternative that gives up little to nothing for many people ... and not just those with lightweight needs any longer.  The OS & Chromium platform and Google apps coupled with cloud storage are completely mainstream. Acre makes a large variety of Chromebooks, the CB515-1HT-C2AE being roughly in the middle of their price range, which spans from about $200 - $800, street prices.  Memory and local storage is more than adequate as long as you are dedicated to using cloud storage.  The processors don\u2019t compare in power to those of more expensive laptops, but then, they are a fraction of the price. Build quality is excellent.  Design excellent.  Screen Excellent.  Usability - excellent and instant. \u201cInstant.\u201d  What does that mean?  That means my 18 year-old granddaughter was functional on the Acer inside of 15 minutes of opening the box.  And she\u2019s thrilled with it. Contrast that with my new MacBook Pro ($3k plus).  I was three days in to *really* complete the set-up.  Now the needs are entirely different.  I\u2019m typically running 15-20 simultaneous apps, 4 different browsers each with a dozen or so tabs open, a VM with Windows 10, and have software development tools as well as photo editing needs.  The thing is, BOTH Windows and OSX are capable of being taken to this level (and far beyond).  It\u2019s that extensive capability, configurability, and extensibility that contributes to the support issues that plague so many people.  ESPECIALLY those who don\u2019t need it! A Chromebook simplifies the entire situation and considerably lowers the cost besides.  Google\u2019s apps are superb for most.  (I use them as well.)  And the Acer is well-regarded.  I\u2019ve owned Acers before and still have one of their newer laptops (a Windows 10 machine) as well.  Acer - like a Chromebook itself - is a mainline choice.  The CB515-1HT-C2AE has been stable, it\u2019s fast when run as intended, and it\u2019s fun. Highly recommended and should be on the short list of anyone who doesn\u2019t have niche or heavy processing needs."}, {"name": "OLT", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "September 8, 2019", "title": "Excellent for my purposes.", "review_text": "Just shy of being a Luddite, I can add no real useful information about this product to the detailed reviews here.  All its specs are on the product page and also mentioned in the better reviews.  So I'll just say why I like this. Since I don't do anything complex on computers, a Chromebook works well for me. (1)  Almost instant start-up, no waiting around for it to boot up like my PC.  I'm not a patient person, so this is a great feature. (2)  Battery life is relatively good, but even better is the fast recharging time. (3)  Big, 15-inch screen.  This is great for streaming videos and movies.  And the image is quite sharp.  Of course, the trade-off for this large screen is that the Chromebook itself is a bit too large for convenient portability.  I just keep this at home. (4)  Easy-breezy set-up.  Takes minutes.  All you need is a Google account. (5)  Sound is good. (6)  Keyboard is backlit.  That's a very handy feature for me. (7)  It's touchscreen.  Another handy feature. In general, this is a good Chromebook.  It has the same strengths and weaknesses of most brands when comparing them to a PC.

I really don't feel like they're built to last. So, when I got a Chromebook a few years ago, I got a Toshiba, and I love it. She's still running strong with no issues! I got this Acer to review it; I really do like it a lot, but it will be interesting to see how it plays out in the long-term. The Acer is quite large. I like the smaller size of my Toshiba, but if you want a nice, beautiful (HD) screen, the Acer will not disappoint. The screen is a touch screen, which I don't find useful for my purposes, but others might like that feature. The sound is great, as well. If you haven't used a Chromebook before, it may take a little getting used to- there are some different keyboard buttons, and what you can do with a CB is a bit different compared to a desktop/laptop. However, if you are used to using a CB and are just looking for something new, I'd consider the size. Again, this is a pretty big Chromebook--maybe that's what you want, or maybe that will cause you to think about something else. Overall, the CB functions well and has a good battery life. As mentioned, the sound is great, and the screen is crisp and clear. It's a great machine--I just hope that as an Acer, it's as reliable as my Toshiba has been (which I'm not getting rid of by any means- just making a comparison!).

I am one of those people who has a million tabs open for all the things I'm either in the middle of researching, need to come back and research, or things I want to hold on to for later. Although I still do that, I finally got to the point where I wanted to have a bigger screen to be able to see things better and be able to type with a keyboard instead of the small keyboard on the phone. So when this Chromebook was up for grabs on Vine I jumped on getting it to try it out. Visually it's great. The subtle back-lit keyboard is super nice for laying in bed without the lights on and still being able to see what you need from the keyboard. The metal look and feel is also very nice. The matte finish is perfect for keeping clean and not leaving smudges all over. It also hasn't been uncomfortable to type on. The keys are very smooth and quiet (perfect if you're a loud/angry typer like I've been told that I am, lol) so the fact that it's quiet is nice when people are around and dont want to hear you typing. The screen size is pretty amazing, as is the quality being that it's 1080p HD. It has 2 USB type C ports (one on each side), 2 regular USB ports (one on each side), 1 MicroSD slot, a headphone jack, and a k lock spot. The sound quality when listening to music or watching videos has been great as well. The only complaints I have are with the following: 1. Battery Life - it states that the battery life can be up to 12 hours, but so far the longest I have gotten out of a single charge is about 6 hours. I'm assuming they rate it at 12 hours if the screen is dimmed to the lowest setting, but I'm not about to strain my eyes. I like mine around 50% brightness. 2. The other thing I'm not very fond of on this book is the center mouse pad. It's not overly sensitive, so it's a little difficult to maneuver over to select things on the screen. I will definitely been needing to get a bluetooth mouse. It also has the left click button built into the pad, but no right click, so again definitely need the mouse. You do have the ability to scroll up and down from the mouse pad, which can be beneficial at times seeing as though it doesn't have a page up/page down buttons. I can't say I'm by any means disappointed with my Chromebook. It's great for easy every day use. And for the price it far surpasses all expectations, and performs much better than other brand Chromebooks I've looked at. It would be perfect for students or someone who doesnt need all the other applications from a regular laptop.

My perceptions of Acer PCs and Chromebooks weren\u2019t positive. I remember checking out Acer PCs that traded expense for quality. The ones I knew were cheap and slow. My Chromebook experience was based on buying one. I lost money when I sold it shortly after because it had performance issues from day one. Flash forward to recently when I received this Acer Chromebook. The first thing I noticed was the size, much bigger than my first Chromebook. Second, after setting it up, I was surprised at the speed. It literally takes just seconds to boot up. I\u2019m using the Acer Chromebook more often than our almost as new Windows PC. I like it more and use it for almost everything. There was a time that I could have made a list of reasons I had to have a PC. Now, the only reason I\u2019m not choosing my new Chromebook one hundred percent of the time is because of one software program. It\u2019s personal finance software that I\u2019ve used for over a decade. I\u2019m ready to ditch it now when I decide on which app to use that provides the functions I need. Everything else, I\u2019m accomplishing through apps. This Chromebook\u2019s 34GB of built-in storage is plenty, especially since everything on our network syncs and backs up to shared cloud services. When I can finally only use my Chromebook and get away completely from the PC, I\u2019ll save money by canceling our subscription virus protection. The Chromebook comes with it at no additional cost, including regular protection updates. I love that any of the personal and business related doc, spreadsheet, picture, slide, etc editing I did on my PC, I can do on the Chromebook. It\u2019s big 15.6\u201d full HD screen lets me see more without scrolling. The screen is also a decided plus when streaming movies and TV shows. The built-in camera and speakers are as good as any I\u2019ve had on a regular PC. If I could change anything, I\u2019d add a cover for the camera for when it\u2019s not in use. Also a built-in microphone for using Hangouts or Duo to video chat would be nice.

Right now, the fans have literally been running, and they are VERY LOUD for the past two hours. I'll close the laptop and the fans will spin down, but within half an hour, they spin up again. The computer actually woke me up last night when the fans kicked in (with the laptop closed). I spoke to support again, and this time the agent told me the behavior was normal. Okay, right. In addition, this computer's track pad is the worst I've ever had.  It's almost unusable. I regret purchasing this machine. It is absolutely the worst computer purchase I've ever made. Original I bought this computer primarily for a mobile DAW. In general, it supports everything I do in terms of audio recording and editing. However, there's a couple caveats I feel I must share with others. 1. The fans are running for no apparent reason. They are tremendously loud and in fact they've been running since I turned on the computer 5 minutes ago. I've disabled all but the essential startup items and currently I am running only Chrome. No other applications are running. The computer isn't even warm. It's really annoying. I was one version behind on the BIOS, so I flashed it with the latest. No change. 2. The track pad isn't great. Sometimes it's weirdly sensitive and mistakes a scroll for a click. Other times scrolling is difficult (it will scroll smoothly and suddenly stumbles requiring that I move the cursor to the side and try again. If that doesn't work I just go to the scroll bar and go from there. So while the computer is suited to my needs, it's drawbacks are very frustrating.

I would give it 4.7 stars if i could. its a great laptop but its not perfect. If you plan on playing games you really need to buy an extra stick of memory with the 16gb model. Games will run mediocre without it but ur frame rates will increase 90-110% when you add the 2nd channel (depending on the game). Shadow of the tomb raider averaged 50fps with med-high settings with 1 channel, it jumped to over 90 fps with ultra high settings. Resident evil 2 remake went from 60-85 to 105-144 (cus vsync probably) on highest settings. It's great for work. The 144hz panel makes everything look smooth. I got lucky, my panel only has a little light bleed in the corners and can only be seen when the screen goes completely dark. Fans are loud. Use headphones. The speakers are pretty good, u need to turn it up really loud to over power the fans.  Panel is not gsync.. but 144hz so doesn't really matter. update: Worked great for about 3 weeks. Then the graphics card decided to disconnect itself from the computer. Couldn't find it in bios. My guess is high temps probably loosened a solder joint.

The build quality is leaps and bounds higher. Virtually no deck flex and feels super solid. The screen quality is good. I do wish it were a 1440p display and/or it had G-sync support, but at least it runs well at 144Hz. As with other nVidia laptops, if you hook up a G-sync compatible display via DisplayPort, it works. The NVME SSD that it comes with isn't incredibly fast compared to the Samsung 960 EVO that I replaced it with, but it's still faster than SATA. Speaking of SATA, it does come with the ability to add your own 2.5\" SATA SSD. Comes with a cage for it, and a special fiddly ribbon connector as it doesn't have SATA data or power ports on the motherboard. Not very difficult to install, but it does require a careful touch to not mess up the ribbon connector's latch. More about upgrades. You can upgrade the RAM. At least partially. Opening the back gives you access to the M.2 slot, SATA drive and 1 DIMM slot. I'm not sure if it has 8GB soldered to the motherboard, or if there's a 2nd DIMM slot on the other side of the motherboard. The speakers on this thing are fantastic. They produce a lot more bass than I initially thought they would. They fire out the right and left sides around the bottom of the keyboard so they aren't easily covered by hands. They can also get quite loud without distorting or vibrating the chassis. It took me a while to figure out the Aura stuff for changing the keyboard lighting (and disabling the light strip on the front which I find kind of obnoxious). The CPU and GPU are both fantastic and keep cool, as well as keeping the keyboard cool so it's comfortable to game on for a long time. Keep in mind that unlike the Pascal cards, the mobile variants of these Turing cards are not identical to the desktop cards. They have a bit less SU's and are clocked a bit slower. The trackpad is glass as well as having separate right and left click buttons. It uses Windows Precision drivers as well. It still has some troubles that I can't seem to work out yet (sometimes input is ignored for a second or two), but most people probably won't use it too often.

I treat my laptops like children, I air dust monthly, wipe down with screen safe cloths, dont remove any of the components or overrun this beast. It's an excellent gaming laptop, but it can get a bit hot sometimes so I bought an extra fan to go under it to keep the interior dust free and more cool when I ran heavy games. Most of the time I dont run this thing to its max because it's a nervous feeling hearing it give it all. I dont move this laptop much, if I do, I never, never drop it. So what happened? Well for starters, the laptop started to get a bit funky after 3 months, when I did add a little pressure to the system and play heavy games (Max settings on FFXV or Archeage, GTAV I never dared) it would unexpectedly blue screen and pop off. At first I was like \"Well okay I'll just lower everything, keep it on resting modes and no run it as hard next time.\" Which worked, up until the next month where the CMD prompt would randomly spasm on the computer. Thought I had a virus and ran multiple security checks on it, turned out clean, left it alone. Finally, the 6th month comes around, the screen just loves to black out frequently. Everything else is working fine, it runs and I even hooked it up to another screen to see that the computer itself is all good but it was literally just the screen causing issues. This is the week that the screen never even bothered to come on, and I believe the screen is faulty after awhile for this particular laptop, as I've been reading up on reviews myself.

The RGB is nice but can be annoying if you leave the laptop plugged in overnight as it will be flashing red continuously. Had a few issues where it would continuously reset the color and not keep it which is better now but still sometimes has this issue. The first game I tested with this was Dead By Daylight, which stuttered like crazy on the lowest settings. Which to be fair, its a terribly optimized game. While playing I felt as though my mouse was lagging and the inputs were delayed? I ended up switching mice, two models of the g502 (wired/wireless) and the issue persisted. Each mouse click felt delayed by up to 250ms or so. This is not normal, couldn't find anything on this so I said whatever and tested a new game, had the same issue.

The fans arent as bad as people think its usually not that loud .  IT cools it very well thats what i like. No thunderbolt 3. One more thing I what super annoying is that this laptop comes with only single stick of 16 gig so single channel .i had to add a stick of ram in there that i had from a previous  laptop. The battery is okay is u will get 3 to 5 hours doing normal things but gaming will be at 30fps . When u connect to charger u get get tripple the performance wich is good if ur trying to reach that 144 hurtz of the display wich feels super smooth and very very quick response time . The camera is crap. One thing i really wish is that the screen was a tad brighter and more accurate .  Especially how heavy it is im wondering that probably this isng goot for college students."}, {"name": "Richard R.", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "October 14, 2019", "title": "Great laptop!

The laptop even overheats, which is understandable, but it reaches temps of nearly 100 degrees celsius (with a cooling pad, and cool ambient temperature).

I would need to send it to USA, but shipping would be too expensive and I use this laptop for my daily work. I'm 99% sure this fan problem is a mix of bug in the BIOS + drivers + ROG Gaming Center. Unfortunately, it seems that I will have to buy another laptop, but you can be sure it will not be an ASUS. ---------------- Original comment: I bought this notebook while my daughter was in USA. Since I live in Brazil, she brought it to me 2 weeks ago. I'm not a gamer, I'm a software developer, so I need a fast machine to do my daily work, and gamers notebooks usually fits this requirement. I was an ASUS fan back in the 90's, when I used to assembly desktop machines with parts from different brands. ASUS was my preferred brand for the motherboards in that time, so I supposed that ASUS notebooks would provide the same quality that I was used to, back in those days. Well, it seems that my expectations was too high. The machine is fast, of course, but I faced two problems that I would like to share:  When you \"click\" in the touchpad, it is like there is something loose inside that hits the plastic chassis mostly where you stand your wrist, causing an weird sensation. The other problem is a \"high frequency\" noise coming from the notebook when the CPU is under some load. I searched the online forums, and this sound seems to be pretty common in ASUS notebooks, and they call it \"coil whine\" sound. It seems to be harmless, but very annoying. The loose touchpad also seems to be common for those notebooks. Unfortunately, ASUS warranty does not cover Brazil, so seems that I'll have to live with those problems. They are not showstoppers, but they should not exist at all in a quality product. Another problem was regarding the (mostly useless) ASUS support. I replaced the original SSD with a (higher capacity) Samsung EVO 970, meaning that I had to do a fresh install of Windows 10. I downloaded all the drivers from ASUS site, but I wasn't able to install the touchpad driver. In the end of the install, it always raised an error. I contacted ASUS support by chat, and they gave me all kind of useless answers, like installing ASUS live, send it to RMA (in my case, this would not be possible), etc. I was sure that there was no hardware problem, since the touchpad worked fine in the bios setup screen, and also worked fine in the pre-installed Windows on the original SSD. It took me more than a day digging into forums, etc until I finally found that I had to install the Intel I/O driver before installing the Precision touchpad driver. This wasn't mentioned anywhere. This solved the problem, but I wonder how ASUS support missed this information! So, I wonder if buying an ASUS notebook was the best choice..."}, {"name": "RAJESH M.", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "February 26, 2019", "title": "Bang for your buck", "review_text": "Very good laptop from a well known reliable company.

(I am talking turtle slow, go get a cup of coffee, make breakfast, and come back to find the computer is still thinking about doing what you are asking it to). Even just simple web surfing is annoyingly slow. There are two choices: either upgrade the ram to 8 gigs OR install a clean copy of Windows 10. You cannot uninstall the bloatware as it has been integrated into the installed Windows 10 operating system. These are your only two options with this laptop. Once I realized that I could not uninstall the annoying bloatware, I decided to completely format the hard drive and install a clean copy of Windows 10. Luckily I already had a copy of windows 10 so I didn't incur any additional costs. If you don't have a copy of windows 10 and don't want to purchase one, then your remaining option will be to upgrade the ram to 8 gigs. If you can do this yourself, it will cost about $40.

For starters, it takes less than 5 minutes to change it from Windows 10s mode to normal (You're even given a prompt as soon as the initial setup is complete), otherwise it's just a 10 second google search. For the specs, it can run any simple task like YouTube, email, word, etc. with ease. The system also comes with an SSD rather than a disk hard drive, making boot up much quicker. There are a few cons that do prevent it from being a 5 star product however. First, the battery life is relatively low, only getting around 2-3 hours doing light-medium work, so if you're going anywhere, make sure to bring the charger. Second, the mouse-pad is off center, which is bad for lefties like me (you're gonna have to buy a mouse or get used to the awkward positioning). Lastly, there is significant bloatware issues upon setup (McAfee, Lenovo apps, a billion Microsoft apps, etc.) making the computer slow at first, but once everything is uninstalled, it runs much smoother. Overall, it isn't a bad system at all. Many of the issues can be rectified with little to no money, and for it's price, I would definitely recommend it to people who want a college/business/recreational laptop, but do not want to break the bank. (note: for gaming, it can run simple games like minecraft, Roblox, LoL at 35-45 fps med-high settings.

Now we come to this AWFUL Windows 10 S mode. For those not familiar with S Mode: some new computers (including this one!) boot to S Mode when you turn them on for the first time. In Windows 10 S mode you cannot uninstall  anything from your new computer and you CANNOT install anything not made or pushed by Microsoft. Lets say you want to install you favorite web  browser. Not so fast! Windows in S Mode will tell you that you already have a wonderful Edge browser and will not let you install one of your choice. Most people do not like this S Mode and Microsoft says \"OK, switch to regular Windows 10.\" To do this just click here, then here and then here and that's it. Well, it took me half a day clicking \"here and here.\" I followed Microsoft instructions to the letter, but my new laptop stayed in S Mode. Then after probably 25 tries, it suddenly worked and it booted into normal, regular Windows 10 and it's fine now.

My only ding on this system is that the colors seem very washed out, not saturated.  I suspect this is due to the matte, non-reflective screen.  That's a nice feature in that you don't get distracted by reflections, but it does make the colors insipid.  I don't think she minds, but I prefer a more vivid display for my own use.

I bought this after my laptop died and I wanted something I\u2019d get quickly and also something cheaper than a laptop. Obviously a chromebook is NOT meant to be a laptop replacement. This does not support gaming like steam or anything hardcore. It doesn\u2019t support the usual apps you\u2019re used to such as iTunes BUT there are ways to get around it if you search up in the chrome store. I\u2019m an online editor and this is still powerful enough to handle that. The touch screen works just fine I love it and the chromebook is very sturdy when flipping the screen I have no worries about it snapping or anything. It\u2019s a good chromebook for the price, you obviously make some sacrifices of what it can handle to a laptop. Microsoft office still works just fine. It can handle the basics and things like Netflix Hulu etc you can have more than one tab open and it not be slow. I think it was a good swap for me compared to purchasing a pricey laptop.

I have a ten-year-old Macbook Pro which is getting heavy and clunky, so thought I'd try an inexpensive Chromebook next, as I'm fairly integrated into Google already. Compared to the Macbook, the touchpad is sticky and friction-y, and will take some getting used to. The lid seems a bit rickety, but possibly that's because it bends all the way back to become a tablet. The keyboard is nice to type on; no issues there. The touch screen seems fairly responsive. It was very easy to set up. My biggest issue thus far is that the Amazon description says 11.6\" screen, which is measured diagonally like a TV, which would be okay, but measured vertically, there is only about 5\" of actual screen, as the \"tray\" takes up a half inch or so (it's really only about 5x10 visible, usable space.)

I would have purchased a rugged military grade ASUS C202SA-YS02 but it was not as pretty as this Acer, so,  in order to please her I bought this Acer.  Being a girl, I figured she would be gentle with it and she was.  However, with in the first few months the Wi-Fi stopped working and it was repaired under warranty which got her through the rest of the school year; when I spoke to the repair technician they confessed this unit has a history of Wi-Fi receiver problems.  Then it rested some over the summer (in other words, not much use).  It has been about 2 months into the school year and the Wi-Fi has stopped working again, only a few days after the warranty expired.  Acer wants $170 to just look at it then add the repair cost on top of that.  The unit cost $275 to start with, so it is not worth repairing.  Buyer-beware! UPDATE: I repaired it myself for $12. I  had nothing to lose since it was a paper weight otherwise.  Upon taking off the bottom cover I spotted the wireless communications chip (pictured) and googled the model number to find resellers. compupartsolutions.com had the best price but yours maybe different. The shame of it is knowing it took me 15 minutes and $12 to fix it and Acer wanted to rob me of $170 just to look at it."}, {"name": "Amazon Customer", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "May 1, 2017", "title": "This is what I came to the future for", "review_text": "I've been EXTREMELY impressed by this device. I was initially a little nervous as the system was somewhat glitchy for the first couple of weeks, seemed to be a problem with the Chrome OS because it was fixed by the next update. I previously had an Acer Chromebook c720 which I LOVED--had it for 3 1/2 years and traveled with it all over the world before the keyboard finally died.  Here are my favorite things about the R11: -Touchscreen: hey, it's not an iPad, but it works great for what I need it to do (reading and annotating e-books and pdfs through Amazon Kindle and a great app called Xodo). If you're an artist, probably not responsive enough, but if you just want to play games and underline the occasional text, this is awesome. -360 degree rotation: LOVE the ability to watch movies in tent mode, turn it into a (slightly heavy, thick) tablet. Switching back and forth is seamless once you get used to it. I was super worried that touching the keyboard when it was in tablet mode would cause it to switch back to laptop mode, but it looks like once you move the screen back past like 180 degrees, it goes into full touchscreen.  Took a week or so to get used to, but love it now. Screen stays in whatever position you put it solidly enough to use the touchscreen. Processor: I currently have 4 windows with a total of 18 tabs open. I streamed an HD movie on Netflix with all those open, no pauses or buffering. Unreal. Battery: SOLID. Seems to have a slightly shorter life than my Acer c720 (which literally went for days), but probably because of the aforementioned dozens of tabs and Netflix. The promised 8-9 hours definitely holds true, and will last longer if brightness is turned down/you're only web browsing, etc. Price. I mean, come on $300 is unbeatable if what you want is email, Netflix, and books. I feel like I have a tablet and super mobile laptop rolled into one. The bad: - speakers are a little tinny (though the volume is AWESOME) and it's not possible to customize the equalizer on the Chrome OS right now :( - though it's a super light laptop, the chromebook is a little heavy as a tablet, not super practical for holding, but if it's resting on something, it's golden.  I mean, if you want a true tablet, buy a true tablet--this did honestly keep me from investing in a kindle as I was planning to. Overall: I'm super happy with this product. So far, I feel like my expectations have been not only met, but exceeded.

I love that it is only as big as it needs to be to have a full-size keyboard (not with a number pad, but full-sized keys). It looks way better in person than in the pictures. White exterior, black keys, very sleek and modern. Since you have access to Android apps on the Google Play Store, you don't have to rely solely on the Chrome browser to access apps. I searched for top android apps for chromebooks on the web, and found which apps work better than Chrome pages. I haven't had issues with the track pad as others have. It feels responsive to me, and I went to settings to customize the speed, clicking, and scrolling. I also bought a wireless mouse, which paired perfectly. Update it as soon as you turn it on!

I mostly do video reviews, but never of specific products. That may change here soon. This this is awesome and has quickly replaced many of my gizmos and gadgets, some that have cost me upwards of thousands of dollars. People who complain that Chromebooks are useless without internet access clearly are narrow minded and simply not thinking outside the box. Allow me to explain:  Let me begin by saying I take tech seriously. Since beginning a journey into a lifelong passion of filmmaking and screenplay writing I have invested tens of thousands of dollars of my own money into PC's that can keep up with the demands of 4k video editing and post processessing. I have amassed a couple of decent PC's, one a custom desktop (still being built; $3K~) and another an ASUS 970m ROG Laptop ($1300~)  that are great for exactly what I need them for. My desktop runs all my video editing software for my bigger and most demanding projects and my laptop is great for editing video and running PC games in places other than my home (like school!). Recently, I've really gotten into writing more and I've found myself coming up with ideas on the go and wanted something a bit lighter than a 10lb ASUS Laptop (that thing is a monster). So mind you I really ONLY purchased to type down ideas as I had them, Seriously. I wanted something I could work on my writing projects on the go, so I paid the $250 for this thing. I just wanted a mobile typewriter. But oh my... I had no idea how far the rabbit hole went, When I recieved the item I was amazed at the quality of it. I've had my fairshare of \"eBay Special\" aka Cheap Chinese iPad knockoffs (seriously, I've owned atleast 8 I think over the past 8 years) and have found each one to be a complete waste of money. Either they were so slow I couldn't get any work done or they just flat out broke after a couple months. I even broke bad and bought an $350 iPad and returned it not too long afterwards (I grew to dislike Apple products as they don't play nicely - or cheap - with just about anything else I own.) I was weary about paying this much for another iPad wanna-be tablet, which has an OS that doesnt go with anything, from a company that specializes in WalMart consumer PCs. But just at first glance, this thing is top quality. Nothing on it feels cheap at all. Not the glass, the display, the aluminum cover, the plastic. All of it feels very strudy (within reason) and has a nice, modern look and feel to it. I feel like this will look good in any decade. Very futuristic. I boot it up and notice quickly the display seems to be 720p (or something close) but for what I need this thing to do... who cares? I just want to type words on it. The touchscreen and the hotkeys along the top take some getting used to but I was quickly in the Google Play Store, downloading all the apps I have on my phone and linking them to my accounts. \"This thing is neat.\" I thought to myself as I was scrolling through Facebook, listening to Pandora and playing my cloud save of Falloiut Shelters. I became a wizard, learning to use the touchscreen, keyboard, and touchpad all in tandem. I prop the thing up to watch a Youtube video. \"This thing is really neat.\" But oh yah! I was supposed to use this to write! So I went to install my favorite screenwriting app, Trelby, only to find its not available. Darn. I use some other apps but nothing is quite the same for my workflow. So I got desperate and booted up Linux on it. After some headaches and code learning, I quickly abandoned the stupid idea when it became more trouble than it was worth and factory reset. I thought the gizmo was neat but I was disappointed that I couldn't really use it the way I wanted to it that regards. This is where the R11 gets interesting. I quickly realized that I could use the Google Remote Desktop app to access my desktop computer. BAM! I was writing on my scripts at home! I was using my whole $3k desktop on this little $250 laptop and it ran flawlessly! I could even watch videos and game from the laptop itself (to an extent). THIS IS AMAZING! But... If i wanted to use it on the go... I would NEED that internet connection to access the files. Man... maybe those negative reviews are right. Maybe this thing does suck without an internet connection.... Except everyone in 2017 is carrying a little WiFi router in their pockets. It's called a cell phone and even my cheap $30 ALCATEL has a tethering option. And just like that, I realized that I can use my studio desktop wherever I want, whenever I want. That is just incredible. For $250 I can control my $3000 PC anywhere. She's got a USB for a tactical mouse and external keyboard, an SD slot and an external HDMI output. This thing is the ultimate mobile workhorse. Sure, it wont completely replace my ROG Laptop is terms of what it can do on its own but the ability alone to access my own desktop and use it as a touchscreen laptop is just amazing. This is the ultimate tablet. This thing is amazing. As a matter of fact, I wrote this whole review on it. Buy it for school, buy it for home, buy on for the grandkids.

Due to the excellent return policy on Prime I decided to purchase this.  Yes, I threw the dice!  1st, I was shocked at how easy it was to set up.  Maybe 2-5 minutes to log into to my gmail account and bang!  Had access to my files stored in the cloud.  In preparation for becoming a chromebook user I had purchased a 256 gig memory card and moved all my laptop files to it.  It worked great.  I now have my files backed up to the card and the cloud. Every app I have downloaded from the google app store has worked perfectly.  Of course, I am not a gamer but I don't see why they wouldn't work also.  Amazon, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, Facebook, Skype, as well as the google suite of docs, sheets, slides, and photos work great. There nwere complaints regarding the lousy screen resolution, as well as the mouse pad not working well.  I guess I got one of the good ones as I have had no trouble at all. Honestly, my 1st computer was a Atari 800 which I hacd to learn Basic programming to get it to do anything.  Since then I have owned HP's, Dells, Compaqs, IBM's, essentially every major computer maker desktops and laptops.  This by far has been the easiest to set up and use.  That's from a guy who has been fighting the technology for 40 years. OK, here's a wake up call to people complaning about the Chrome OS.  Quite simply, this is not a Windows machine.  Period.  It does not look like windows nor does it act like windows.  It reminds me a great deal of my Samsung Note.  It is fast and simple.  That said, there are windows software that you cannot even attempt to use on this machine.  For instance, MS Project, MS Visio,  software like that.  You can however download from the playstore MS Office suite.  I did not and will not do this.  I am trying to break from Mr. Gates and this machine allows me to do this.  Did I mention, I can access all my word, excel, and powerpoint files using the google apps.  Also, when need be I can save the docs as pdf's like I had to do for updatiung my website.  Oh, by the way, Weebly website builder works great on this chromebook. I also read reviews that the sounds wasn't good on this machine.  I downloaded Pandora and listened to all my stations at 3/4 volume and it sounded fine.  The speakers are not like my JBL 4311 studio monitors at home but they sound good enough to watch Netflix. Of course, I have only had this Acer for a week.  I am really putting it to the test.  If something happens within 30 days I will return it but I will get another one. One irritating item that was a easy fix, The chromebook really wants to save to the cloud and not to the card I installed on the computer.  If you go into setting and click the advanced tab you can decide where you want to save your files.  You also have the choice of it asking you everytime where to save the document.

I chose this one mainly because of the full size keyboard, larger screen, and full size HDMI.  Most specs were similar between the two as far as performance/battery life/touch screen.  I bought a new device (1 year Acer limited warranty).  Here are some of the things I wanted to know during my research: 1. Touchpad.  A LOT of negative complaints about the touchpad.  It does make quite a loud click when you depress the button.  I use tap-to-click, so it's not an issue for me.  You CAN right-click by using two fingers to tap the track pad at the same time (or 2 fingers on the touchpad, using one of them to press press down/click the touchpad).  The feel of the touchpad is not as smooth (frictionless) as others I have used, but it's not terrible either.  I have not had any finger detection issues. 2. You cannot open it with one hand like a Mac.  However, it does feel like a sturdy hinge.  The screen does not wobble as there is a good amount of friction holding it where you put it.  When closed, the two slabs of the computer are noticeably discrete, but flush against each other (they don't form a smooth ovoid shape when closed like other laptops). 3. Reserve your judgement until you've updated the software entirely.  Performance will be poor unless you click \"Restart to update\" on the lower right corner of the screen (symbol is a small arrow pointing up).  This may happen multiple times for ChromeOS, Adobe, or other programs.  After this, performance will pick up to what you would expect.  I have not had any freezing or screen flashing issues. 4.  It's a chromebook.  Giving lower stars for not realizing its limited capabilities is your own fault.  I love the feel of a lighter OS and can do many tasks using Google/Web based apps. Overall:  I like it and am happy for paying a bit over $200 for the 4gb model (at the time of writing this, it sells for $220 new).  I can live with the so-so touchpad since the rest of it feels solid/sturdy.  I bought a new device so I wonder how many technical issues (freezing, finger detection issues) came from people who bought used devices.  One plus I'm particularly happy about: a quiet fan-less device that doesn't heat up too much!

The 1 App that is giving me a problem pertains to the sign-in process, the App gave me a choice to sign in with a Facebook account, Google account, or Email account. I chose to sign-in using my Google account which did not work properly, it seems that the Chrome OS was not able to supply the correct account information to the Android App. So my advice is to use an email account if possible to sign-in any Android Apps that you originally set up that way. Now about the Chromebook, I am very impressed with the speed and physical design. I have always been a \"mouse\" guy and actually have a wireless mouse operating on this Chromebook, but I find myself using the touchpad more and more. I have read about people having trouble \"right clicking\", scrolling and a few other problems (as I did), my advice is to use the \"Help\" function to see the correct methods to use the touchpad.

They do get loud and if you want an extra boost, look up EARS for Chrome. Android Apps: This is very cool, being that we still have the original ACER Chromebook which is about 5 years old, looks great, runs as good as it did when we bought it, but it doesn't have Play Store access.

I use this for my schoolwork, a LOT of Netflix/Hulu/Amazon Prime/Xfinity streaming and have started using it to take notes in staff meetings at work because it's so light to carry around.  Still charges fast and I can charge it about every other day and be fine.  If it's a little low from a binge watching evening I can plug it in while I shower and dress and it has plenty of juice to last me all day at work.  I didnt particularly care for the straight white color so I purchased a Decalrus Decal Skin and it's gorgeous.  I took a picture of the decal and set it as my wallpaper so it all matches.  I get TONS of compliments on it at the library,coffee shops, and at work. It's been less than a week but so far so good.  I don't mind the keyboard size, I have pretty tiny girl hands so it's quite comfortable for me.  I can see how someone with larger hands would have issues.  The picture is sharp and crisp.

I use this mostly, right now, for gaming and reading.  With the keyboard flipped over, it makes a slightly bulky tablet that displays a full page in color beautifully.  finally the perfect tool to read some of my larger volumes and magazines.  I can even rotate to view single page full screen. And yes, connect to wifi and run the first update.  After that, you'll have nearly full access to the android store.  I think it registers as a tablet, so the games that limit or restrict tablet use (like Pokemon Go) will also restrict this device.  But the influx of options from the google play store add some very powerful tools to the slowly growing, but still thin chromeos options. Oh, and the nicest change from the c720 is the SD reader.  Now, instead of thecard sticking out all the time, it click-inserts fully and flush.  So, now you can leave the card in all the time and still zip into a tight neoprene case.  Also, the AUX jack has been moved to the other side to help reduce the accidental power cord plug in failures. I've never been this excited about a laptop before.

With a little care, I've managed to keep this in good condition. just discovered today however that this model is part of the Linux beta program. I installed Linux with very little difficulty, and then a couple of applications. tried to install Minecraft but had some problems could be me. I'll go for some standard apps like Gimp,  LibreOffice and civ Free. Linux runs in a pocket like any emulator, but any folder you put at the top level appears in the downloads folder under a special Linux section. you can pop files in and out of the Linux experience as simply as dropping them into the downloads.

I bought this for my wife, and liked it so much I bought one for myself.  The Acer R11  is my favorite computer of all time.  Its rugged, trouble-free, and totally reliable.  Never freezes up, never makes me wait more than a few seconds for updates,  runs all day on a battery charge, and doesn't take long to recharge. It has a nice, bright display, excellent touchpad and keyboard, and works well in the tablet mode. Even though it has only a Celeron processor, it's remarkably speedy on the net and can run several Chrome tabs without bogging down. I can't imagine why anyone would need a Chromebook with a faster processor.  Unless you are doing something really unusual, like running movies in several different windows, you wouldn't notice much difference in performance.  In a side-by-side comparison, my son's $2K i7 computer and my R11  appeared  so evenly matched when rendering a complex web page it was hard to tell which computer won, I still keep a windows laptop around for running specialized windows apps, such as PCB design software and controlling milling and 3d printing machines, but otherwise I can go months without ever touching the windows machine.  And that suits me fine  After experiencing the Chrome OS I have no further desire to deal with Windows unless I absolutely have to.  Windows is so annoying,  I have talked three other friends and family members into switching to R11's and they are all very happy they did.  The R11 runs most Android apps I have tried, but since Chromebook apps pretty much handle everything I need to do, I don't use the R11 to run android apps."}, {"name": "geri morgan", "rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "August 19, 2017", "title": "Nice Chromebook for a decent price", "review_text": "Wanted to update to a Chromebook that could access Google Play Store apps.

Great, so all I need is a wifi card to replace the failed one. Well customer service would not send me one even though according to their warranty agreement, they are allowed to send replacement parts to the consumer(yes it is up to Acer's descresion according to the agreement). It's just bad business practice to only offer a repair if the user can be without their computer for weeks and pay for shipping. In fact, I don't think they're honoring the warranty if they do not make accomodations to the user. A product should not ever fail within the first 3 months if it has a 1 year warranty. I ended up buying a wireless card because I could have my computer back up in running in 3 days rather than 2 weeks. This way I would not miss anymore homework assignments. But now my wireless card failed again after about a month. So here I have had to spend an additional $50 in ownership for 5 months of use. It's a bad purchase taking into account no warranty support.

In addition to the weird keyboard (see below), starting this week it will not stay connected the internet.  My HP laptop doesn't have this problem, and both the laptop and the Chromebook are connected to the same wireless internet service. Searching the internet finds various suggestions, e.g. \"powerwashing,\" but some users say this doesn't work, so I hesitate to try it - I hate solutions that say, \"try this,\" try that,\" etc... I just want the darned thing to work. Also, various apps do not work correctly,  for example, Google Calendar shows part of the day, but the scroll bar does not appear, so I can only see certain hours of the day.  Every time I use this Chromebook, I wish I hadn't bought it. === Original review below === I've been using computers and keyboards for 40+ years - and this device has the WORST keyboard in recent memory.  The product description claims this device \"...maximizes productivity with fully functional keyboard...\"  While it's the same size  and shape as my laptop keypad, for some reason I cannot reliably position my fingers on the correct keys.  I often find I've typed an entire sentence (or more) with my fingers on the wrong keys, which is very unproductive when trying to take real-time notes in a meeting!  Or any time, really!  I eventually realized that my HP laptops have a small raised \"bar\" on F and J keys - it's very subtle, but it lets me know - without looking - that my index fingers are correctly placed on the keyboard before I start typing.  The keypad is my main complaint about this device, but it also seems rather \"clunky\" and ugly compared with similar devices, and the white color just makes it worse.  If you're gonna buy a clunky ersatz computer, get a darker-color - it won't be as noticeable.  I wish I had shopped for this product in a store where I could physically try it and compare with similar products - I'm quite sure I would have decided to spend a bit more money to buy one of the better-designed competitors."}, {"name": "Christopher L", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "August 23, 2017", "title": "Very Satisfied", "review_text": "I am a tech/gadget junkie...I'll put that right out there.

He found it easy to customize and shared this aspect with his computer programming brother, who now owns several Chromebooks and is a fan for life. Those points are true of Chromebooks in general, but this Acer model really goes above and beyond with the intuitive and efficient conversion back and forth between the following set-ups: laptop, display, tent, and pad.

I had reservations about the convertible package, but it is well done.  The hinges are cleverly made to give good friction and geometry throughout the range except the last little bit in either direction.  Then the lid sort of snaps into place as it is closed or fully folded back.  The unit is off-white or beige- colored.  There is a nice texture to the finish.  The unit is light enough to carry between thumb and fingers.  There are no fans.  Warming is minimal.  Battery life is somewhere well beyond 7 hours and charging is quick. The touchscreen is sensitive and smooth.  The keyboard is comfortable and has a decent feel.  Despite some of the criticisms by others, I find the touchpad to be smooth and responsive.  One thing I learned quickly is that the pressure on the touchpad has to be very light.  For example, if your finger pressure is too high, the cursor sort of sticks.  The two-finger stroke for scrolling up and down when viewing document or a webpage works very well in lieu of a mouse thumbwheel.  Just lightly brush the touchpad with the 2nd and 3rd fingers.  Most of the chromebook multi-touch gestures seem to work.  I haven't had consistent luck with the two-fingered tap for right-click, but \"alt + single-tap\" does the same job.  \"Tap to click\" is sensitive, which can cause problems if you tend to drag palms on the touchpad while typing. I connected a bluetooth mouse, which I prefer to a touchpad for moving the cursor.  Logitech M557 (large mouse) and Verbatim 98590 (small mouse) work fine, without evidence of the sleep problems experienced with Windows.  The chromebook mouse interface doesn't seem to support adjusting thumbwheel sensitivity, which is one reason the two-fingered touchpad gesture for scrolling is valuable.  The only mouse adjustment is pointer speed.  The special Windows button on the M557 pops up the App Launcher.  Between the touchpad and the touchscreen you really do not need a mouse with this system. The display is just \"okay.\"  I operate it at full brightness.  It is a little bit sensitive as to vertical viewing angle.  The resolution is adequate for most purposes.  In the tablet mode, in portrait orientation, I could comfortably read a full magazine page of the Economist, for example.  This involves very small print rendered as an image rather than as font.  The lower resolution causes a gentle blurring of the print in this situation, when compared to the crisp display on my Nexus 9.  (Zooming the magazine display in laptop mode seems to be a better alternative.) Speaker volume is excellent.  Half volume is about right for watching a Netflix movie.  Dialog clarity is fine. Many of the android apps I care about work fine, and this will probably improve with time.  This fact makes the chromebook a nearly complete replacement for a laptop.  Nook**, Kindle, 3M's Cloud Reader and Overdrive android reader apps work fine, and the device makes an excellent ereader, offline or on.  The Microsoft Outlook android app works fairly well, with some quirkiness.  About every 3rd time I send something it encounters an error and, fortunately, saves the message as a draft.  Excel, Word and OneNote android apps aren't compatible with this device.  The online equivalent apps work fine, although starting up the OneNote application seems slightly clumsy. My unit came loaded with File Commander by Mobi Systems.  I installed android OfficeSuite Pro, made by the same people, in order to provide an off-line office system other than Google's.  OfficeSuite Pro integrates with File Commander and can access GDrive and OneDrive and can open password-protected files.  File Commander offers a scheme for transferring files to a PC via wifi.  ( ESS File Explorer offers an FTP interface I think is better.)  File Commander insists on having access to  contacts, maybe for \"sending\" files to others. I could not get HP's eprint scheme to work but was able to install HP's \"All-In-One Remote\" android app.  This software enables printing to and scanning from my HP C8610 printer while connected to my home network.  Printing is only for pdf files, but the Chrome browser, OfficeSuite Pro and other apps support printing to pdf as an intermediate step. It looks like this is going to be a 95% replacement for my laptop, especially when travelling, and I am very happy that I bought it. ** Nook's reader is touchy for me.  It breaks if one tries to read a book in two-column mode in a maximized window.  Minimized, it works fine either in two-column or one-column mode.

When I needed to buy a laptop and saw the price tags on most Mac Books and laptops, I almost cried. How the heck was I supposed to get through all my classes without one, yet I couldn't afford them. Then I discovered these Chromebooks. For about a third the price, I get all the functionality I needed. I have had this thing for a couple of years now and can confidently tell you I still love this thing. The battery lasts for a crazy long time, and its so lightweight and portable. I love that it's small and compact and fits into my tote purse.

Both of which were expensive laptops at one time.  Needing to purchase a more current computer on a much tighter budget, I did a lot of research and opted for the Acer Chromebook R11.  I knew before I purchased it,  that I shouldn't expect (or become angered by) a level of quality that was not as high as my former laptops.  The less-than-expensive price tag  was a HUGE first clue.  Also, remember that laptops and notebooks are from the same fruit bowl but definitely not the same fruit. Notebooks are generally smaller and don't weigh as much as a typical laptop. Those two elements of a notebook explain why a laptop is able to \"out manuver\" a notebook. More functions = more hardware = more wieght. With all of that in mind, I am very happy with my purchase. The notebook is, as previously mentioned, VERY  light-weight, modern in color and design, and by taking just a bit of time learning how this \"new(ish) breed\" of notebooks work, I can say that I would definitely buy it again.  The creators of the Chromebook know that there is a small learning curve when first discovering how to navigate their product. There is printed material included with the notebook that addresses some of the differences, as well as, websites that do the same (both the product websites and personal blogs from unbiased reviewers). At first I wasn't happy at all with the trackpad, but after reading one of the blogs I previously mentioned, I was able to fix the \"out-of-control\" feel when using the trackpad by learning that it works much like my previous Mac. Trackpad \"smoothness\" is obtained by using a specific number of fingers \"swiping\" in different directions. A shortcut that I am loving more and more everyday. There is still a bit of a \"clunky\" sound when clicking on the trackpad. However, I usually \"tap\" the trackpad rather than \"click\" it anyway. And remember...VERY affordable price tag. Personally, I LOVE the keyboard. I was expecting to have to type on a truncated keyboard with little room for my hands/wrists. Not so. Rather than trying to  cram all the \"normal\" keys on the keyboard, the creators developed different keyboard shortcuts that give the user most of the functions he/she is accustomed to having. There is also an online keyboard that gives the user even more options. The only thing I miss from my former keyboards, are the ten-key pad and the backlit keys. AGAIN...won't-break-the-bank price tag. The  size and quality of the screen was a nice surprise. The picture is sharp and the colors vivid. I find that since the screen is nearly edge to edge, it creates the feel of a much larger screen. The quality of the sound was also a real surprise. I didn't expect the it to be so full-bodied and powerful. As for the convertable ablilities of the notebook, I land somewhere just a little to the left of \"Highly Satisfied\"... more like \"Almost Highly Satisfied\". This is why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5.  When I play my favorite games, the sizes are wonky. In tablet form, since my games are vertically oriented and the \"tablet\" dimensions are basically tall and skinny, the games appear HUGE. This is good for those who normally need their readers to see the games but it makes me feel almost cross-eyed when playing them. I've also experienced a glitch that sometimes \"freezes\" the move I just made so I have to touch the screen again to \"unfreeze\" my move.  But this only happens every now and then so it's not a deal breaker for me. However, there are websites that address both issues but I haven't had time to see if the \"fixes\" work. All in all, I feel like I came out ahead in the game of cost vs function. There are still several functions that I have yet to use and more \"hidden\" functions that I have yet to uncover. If you are looking for a notebook that is much more affordable than the well known \"giants\" of computer land, this notebook would be a very good choice. Just remember the INEXPENSIVE PRICE TAG. If you think you ordered a really cheap \"apple\" you are going to be disappointed when you receive an \"orange\" (albeit a very juicy one).

In flip mode, it perches just fine.  I can't really do that w/ any of my regular form factor laptops. 2) Battery life is very impressive: 12 hours. 3) It's great for doing something while parked in the car.  I've had some useful teleconferences after pre-downloading docs from my local wifi, and then having them kept open in my chrome browser.  State was kept, (in other words not reloaed upon flipping back open) which I was a bit worried about. 4) The weight.  It's very very very light.  Did I mention how light it is? 5) I like the centered keyboard.  I've always like the Mac style centered keyboard, and the PC style left shifted keyboard (for the number pad) has always been an annoyance.  The science (from area 51) is in, and shows that non-centered keyboards will actually turn you into a hunchback in 3 days time, unless you crack your back with a clockwise twist at the end of the day. 6) I't be great for taking on vacation:  None of your data would have to be on it (so you can skip TSA & customs violating your right-to-privacy: \"here ya go, you idiots\") and you can tablet for entertainment, or keyboard for worky-worky type stuffs. What I dislike: 1) The battery charger connector is the poorest fit & finish I've ever encountered.  It just rattles around in there.  In order to charge it reliably, I park it next to a vertical edge and push the connector into it's rattly little connection configuration, and then butt that up against the vertical edge.  All that said, if I do that, it charges just fine.  But still... sheesh! What I'm still getting used to: 1) Everything done from Chrome -- although I don't know exactly why this is a mental problem for me, since 95% of what I end up doing is browser based, anyway. 2) The whole google doc/slides/sheets look & feel. I'd also be interested in one of the larger screen models -- if I can find a good 15\" one, I might treat myself sometime. I also saw (a friend sent me some links) there are Linux installs (as virtual machines?) that go on top of the Chrome OS.  That's nice, because I've been a Linux kinda guy for the last 20 years.

I actually sent my unit back in for a replacement because I thought it was defective, however I had the same issue with the replacement. It's not a dealbreaker, just an annoyance - sometimes when you tap the screen, it registers as a tap-and-hold. So the app thinks you're holding your finger down on the screen until you tap again to release it. It's very sporadic, not happening at all on some days, and then happening on every other tap on other days; no rhyme or reason. Again, not a dealbreaker, but something I've learned to just be patient with. Great battery life, lasts all day at work with me (screen brightness turned down a bit most times though). Tablet mode works well, but sometimes gets a little janky - for instance, on two occasions, it got stuck in 180 degree rotation after taking it off tablet mode, but it's quick/easy enough to change, no big deal. Random sidenote: Sometimes Android apps run better than their web counterparts on this device.

Chrome OS is very light, so the machine is useable within 10 seconds of starting.  The battery lasts forever, as advertised.  The performance is wonderful as well.  This Chromebook is surprisingly powerful.  As of now, I have 10 Chrome tabs open while streaming Spotify with no issues.  For anything browser based, this feels identical to a high end laptop like a MacBook Pro at a fraction of the price.  As well, the thing is incredibly light.  It's half the weight of my old laptop, and I often forget it's in my backpack. I've only had one issue, and it's not the fault of the manufacturer or Chrome OS.  I've attempted to create a profile on the Chromebook with my ASU email managed by Gmail.  I haven't been able to, because ASU has some funky authorization rules and won't let the Chromebook create a profile with the email.  Of course, I can access the ASU email from the browser after logging into the Chromebook, but I'd really like to be able to actually create a user account with that email.  Other than that little quirk, my experience has been flawless.  Highly recommend this machine."}, {"name": "T.

My impressions on the construction, keyboard feel, and display were highly favorable. The tiny, tinny speakers leave some to be desired, but with Bluetooth connectivity I can easily send the audio to a better system. After owning the device for about a month, the wifi began suddenly cutting off. I tried shutting down and restarting, which sometimes restored the wifi connection, but never permanently. I searched the web and found the solution: the wifi card and its antenna wires became dislodged. It's an easy fix that involves removing the back cover, popping out the wifi card, and reinstalling it.  You can find videos on how to do this if you search on \"Chromebook WiFi Turned off / disabled\" Given the number of complaints I've seen, this seems to be an inherent problem with this model. I don't know whether it was an assembly mistake that, once fixed, will not reoccur, or whether this is an ongoing maintenance issue. I'm still otherwise happy with the R11, but because I had to repair it (albeit slightly) after only a few weeks, I've given it only 3 stars.

The first one was also an Acer I bought last year. I liked the first one for general Web access around town but thought it was too big for travel so that's why I looked for one a couple of steps smaller in size. This fits the need. The display resolution is less than the other Acer which was a full HD display (1920x1080) but I can live with that. Even with the lower resolution the display is quite good. It does come with an SD slot which is great for transferring pictures onto my GDRIVE. The other Acer did not have that. I also liked that the keyboard and keys are the same size as the larger Chromebook but I wish it had a back light. The touch pad is of course smaller but I usually use a wireless mouse. Otherwise it has the same 4G of memory and quad-core processor as the larger model. I've never tried a Chromebook with lesser hardware but performance seems adequate as I can load multiple websites easily. The only thing I have not used on this Chromebook is the touch screen.

I recently had an incident with my mac and was not looking to buy anything crazy expensive. When I first got it the main thing that bothered me was that the mouse felt sticky almost like it wasn't going. I also felt super lost because I'm used to my Mac. However, once i figured out how to change the mouse speed it was so much better. Turned it all the way up and felt normal again. The folding is very nice, kind of hard to hold it as a tablet but very neat. The google/android apps are a really awesome addition. You can download most games you have on your phone I believe. Another thing that bothered me was that the speakers were on the bottom of the laptop and the screen feels very small and almost hard to look at at times. Adjusting the brightness helps but if you can't see good I would suggest something with a bigger screen.  My battery also seems to not last as long as advertised. while using it i'm getting more like 6 hours of use? Not sure if im doing something to drain the battery though, I'm probably just on it too much lol. TLDR; Pros: Loud speakers Bright screen Android apps Able to be folded multiple ways Affordable Touchscreen Easy to type on- keys have a little texture to them Cons: Small screen Speakers on bottom No lit keyboard Touchscreen not very sensitive Battery life not as good as advertised All in all, I am glad i purchased it. It was a great deal and it is close to my old mac book in some ways. It is definitely a change from a pc or mac to a chromebook but i'm getting used to it fast and would definitely recommend to someone looking for a casual use small laptop!

No powerhouse, it is still quite capable of performing the tasks I got it for: Video watching, music listening, e-mail, web, and light games (i.e. Bejeweled). Sadly, ChromeOS forces me to use my Google account password. This would mean having to make my password more memorable, and therefore less secure.

Just WOW!!!", "review_text": "Was very pleased; actually really impressed. Bought it as an Amazon warehouse deal that stated the packaging would be damaged, so there was a bit of anxiety prior to powering on. What it basically meant was that the corner of the box was smooshed just a lil bit causing Amazon to have to cut the manufacturer seal on the box to inspect the contents for damage. As you know, once the seal is broken on the box that the product leaves the manufacturer, the product must be considered either used, refurbished, or sold at least at a discount price. My luck on this one. I could easily see this device being worth twice what I paid. The size is perfect, not bulky, heavy or overly thick. Actually is thinner than a Galaxy tab while inside a book type protective case. The speed for a Chromebook is phenomenal. As most of you, I am used to windows on my laptops/desktops. The use of a mobile OS on this type of device is something I've always supported as I prefer removable memory anyway.  An external hard drive or any size SD card really opens up the potential for this 2-in-1. Screen is very responsive. I am a heavy Samsung user and the responsiveness and fluidity of the touchscreen, and the touchpad is quite similar for anyone who has become spoiled by the top of the line functionality usually paired with their devices. The reflectiveness of the screen is not a problem at all, and viewing angles are perfect for its purpose. I mean you are not going to be streaming movies for large audiences to view directly from that screen; and when I watch anything or interact with my device, I am in front of it lol. Anyway, if you are on the fence about this product, I say GO FOR IT!!!

Pro: On time delivery, which is 25% the distributor and 75% the shipping company. Brand new product as listed. No scratches or any markings to be found upon first inspection. Unit was ready to go out-of-the-box with enough charge to get set up and hit the ground running. The OS experience so far is satisfactory. I knew a little of what to expect with a ChromeOS and so far I'm happy with how it feels to navigate and use. I would say it is very similar to an Android based phone (Galaxy S4+ user here) with exception to some items not yet being compatible from the Play store. Screen is crisp and undamaged. Great for watching a movie or show in bed. Hard drive size is more than enough especially if you use Google Drive for pictures. If not, it can easily interface with an external memory which would be recommended anyway if you care enough about the files. The unit appears fast and powerful for the apps it can run, but again this is my first full-time experience. Con: Touch screen isn't very touchy. Looking into adjusting this but it would appear to benefit from a stylus (not included, sadly). Even if it was more reactive to touch, a stylus would help out greatly for precision. This is something I can control, however, and is apparent for most touchscreen items such as these. And no, I do not have a screen protector (yet). Overall I would recommend this product. Cheaper than a standard laptop with more battery life and flexibility. We use Google Docs and it is great for basic word/sheet needs plus being able to share between the family. There's not much I can say negatively about the product that isn't due to either a 3rd party app or interface. These types of cons should not reflect the overall rate in my opinion as my view of an app, like Facebook or a Camera app, is on them and something that they need to control. If you need a more powerful laptop (advanced word/excel or gaming) then look elsewhere than a Chromebook. If you just need to use Facebook, IM, basic doc/excel like small business owners such as us, then this is more than enough. I selected 4 stars because it takes a lot to earn 5.

If your expectations are reasonable (i.e. don't expect to find a large screen, don't expect to run intense programs or games) then I think you will be happy with this. The notebook comes with Windows 10S (not windows 10) which can be upgraded free and easily.  If the upgrade is not made, then you are limited to the programs/apps in windows' store which is not very comprehensive.  The only issue here is that the Windows 10 version the upgrade goes to is 64 bit (not 32) which has compatibility issues with some older programs. I found the eMMC disk drive to be fast, the computer boots in a few seconds.  There is a Micro SD slot.  256GB micro sd card is only around $25 and is immensely helpful in increasing available storage (buy a name brand only; i.e. microcenter, sandisk, pny, crucial, kingston, etc etc).  The internal eMMC drive or the RAM can not be upgraded. WiFi is strong, the screen is only 11.5\" but is very bright and has very good resolution and color.  The USB ports are V 3.x.  The keyboard does not feel cramped or compromised in any way despite the small size of the notebook.  Too bad it does not have a trackpoint which would be very helpful in navigating more precisely on the small screen. I have only had this so far for a week so I can not comment on durability.  The card slot seems a bit flimsy. I have been unable to get anything near the \"whole day\" claim on a battery charge.  6 hours is about it but obviously that is still very good. Overall I believe this is a very good choice especially for this price range; this laptop is not much heavier than a tablet but is much more useful.

Looks good, feels as solid as one can expect, nice response feel on the keys, crisp display and bright, and lightning fast... for a reason. First things first, I ripped Windows out of this mini laptop shortly after powering it up. Why? Windows is a memory and resource hog. Secondly, the amount of information they want just to run the laptop outside Windows S mode is ridiculous. Hence, Windows had to go, so it I took it out. In place of Windows I installed Manjaro Linux, based off the Arch Linux distro, using the Xcfe interface system. Both are considered light weight and just seemed perfect for this mini laptop. The OS slid right in without a single problem, it picked up all the hardware on boot-up, and the response times proved better than I hoped. As a test of the battery, I loaded up Youtube with 15 hours of videos and let it run. After nearly exhausting the 15 hours of videos, the laptop battery finally gave up. It impressed me since it played for 14 hours and 27 minutes non-stop. Moreover, the speakers sounded much better than I thought they would. A little tinny, but what could anyone really expect? The laptop never got too warm, either, considering it is a fanless system. It just powered through without a hiccup. After ten days of regular use it seems rock solid. The shakedown period ran without a hitch. The distro comes with automatic updates, so the OS is kept fresh and update. The WiFi range is quite good. I remained connected to my WiFi for just about fifty feet, and the signal needed to pass through walls. The camera is okay, but to be honest I do not use it much if at all. I simply tested it. At just over two pounds, it travels well in my backpack and I use it during my commutes to and from the office. LibreOffice runs like a champ. GIMP runs like a champ. Audicty runs like a champ. KPatience is quick and fun. Firefox with extensions is incredibly fast... faster than on my main desktop. This is a great little mini laptop and, with the Manjaro OS changes, is worth more than purchase price. I highly recommend it since it proved so amenable to modification.

I can't find enough good things to say about this portable powerhouse. I'm a pretty hardcore gamer who also uses a lot of graphics intensive programs like Photoshop and Unreal 4. This laptop... is not for that. It's for those times away from your high-end programs, where you need 10 chrome tabs open in a coffee shop while you're experimenting with Microsoft Word layouts. It's for when you're out in the woods and want to sort and organize the photos on your camera's SD right then and there. It's for trips where you want to travel light, but still want the world at your finger tips. OK, OK, enough flowery language. Let's get to the pros / cons: Pros: -The keyboard feels great, with a nice balance of being chunky and \"clicky\" while still being compact. Once you get used to its size, it's pretty easy to get close to your fastest typing speeds with minimal errors. -This thing is really light. Maybe I'm too sued to heavier laptops, but seriously, this thing is effortless to bring around. Throw it in a backpack, tuck it under your shoulder, do whatever. This thing is pretty durable from what I can tell, so all that lightness doesn't come at the cost of having to gingerly secure it in a special compartment. Any ol' laptop bag / pocket will do! -The battery life is great! Maybe I'm too used to being tethered to outlets by more power-hungry machines, but I was able to get hours of typing and Chromeing out of this thing. The key I've found (as with most machines) is to keep the brightness a bit low when you're not plugged it, it can make a big difference. -ASUS has always made my favorite laptops and this one is no exception. If you're a fan of ASUS' work, you'll find everything you know and love about and ASUS packed into a tiny package. -The ports, lordy, the ports! So many ports in such a tiny machine. -The screen is far brighter and more colorful than I was expecting. My other laptop is a \"state-of-the-art\" ROG Strix II, with a high color accuracy, high refresh-rate display... the issue is they never calibrate said displays and they always end up coming out sickly yellow, requiring hours of manual adjusting. Not this little fighter though! Bright and beautiful right out of the box! Color pureists will notice things can get a bit washed out, but it's certainly preferable to the yellow tint of other machines. -The price is the best I've seen for the quality of machine you're getting. This thing is durable, sturdy and built for a few specific things it excels at. It's definitely given my productivity a boost and is well worth the investment. -There was pretty minimal bloatware on the machine, which was great. -Office 360 for a year is a HUGE plus. Also be sure to upgrade the machine to full Windows 10 (from S), the process is free, fast and jarringly painless. Cons: -Even 64 GBs is not a a huge amount of space. This is definitely more of a document and cloud oriented device. If you're hoping to put your entire music library on this thing you're going to need to expand the storage. If storage isn't an issue, than this is probably the book for you! -Similarly the 4 GBs of RAM can make this little engine chug sometimes. Don't expect it to be happy with running 20 chrome tabs at once,n or for it to instantly load pages the moment you click them. It's certainly fast enough, but as someone who's coming from a 16 GB machine the little differences can be noticeable. -The touch pad is ... OK. It's not terrible, but (much like all touch pads these days) it loses tracking now and then and lacks any real buttons for the left and right. I never much enjoyed touch pads to begin with so maybe I'm biased. Closing thoughts: If you like what you've read, read more reviews and honestly take the dive. If you're looking for a durable portable typer, that can do a little bit of everything this is your machine! More closing thoughts: A story for you, about ASUS laptops... In winter I got an ROG Strix II, a very powerful and very pricey machine. It was maddening getting the thing to work properly. Getting photoshop to play nice with the dual graphics. Getting the screen to not look yellow. Getting the damn speakers to not crank the bass. Many of these issues are still unresolved and frankly though I love the hardware I'm more than likely going to have to start from square one with that thing. I was all emotionally prepared to go through the same process with this little trail-blazer. I was ready to troubleshoot and troubleshoot and finally get something that mostly did what I needed. To my absolute delight, this machine seems to be the last bastion of PCs that do everything right, everything the way they're supposed to, right out of the box. I haven't had to troubleshoot a single thing about this beautiful laptop and honestly couldn't be happier. If you're looking for something portable, something durable, something to up your productivity and most of all something easy to work with, this is the laptop for you."}, {"name": "Amazon Customer", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "October 13, 2019", "title": "Writing papers and watching academic presentations?

The 512 GB SSD feels fast and speedy. The 16Gb of fast ram is nice. The i7 processor is a beast, with speed (and noisy fan) bursts when needed. This is a fast, well-optioned machine inside. The screen is nice and the 14 inch size is a nice compromise vs the larger 15.6 and 13 inch sizes. The chicklet keyboard is reasonable, and it is backlit which is a very nice touch. The fingerprint detector has been working reliably for me, but that isn't a feature that I care a lot about. I'm fine with logging into my computer with a PIN code or webcam. The Acer Spin 3 Convertible Laptop, 14\" Full HD IPS Touch, 8th Gen Intel Core i7-8565U, 16GB DDR4, 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD, Backlit KB, Fingerprint Reader, SP314-53N-77AJ has a rechargeable active stylus, which is not - in my opinion - up to the task of doing artwork on a computer. It IS fine for note-taking and rough drawing, but for serious art-work I think it needs to be better. Still, it is definitely a nice touch. So what is my big beef with the Acer Spin 3? THE CONNECTIVITY OPTIONS ARE SERIOUSLY LACKING!. There is NO USB-C. If you aren't familiar with USB-C (I wasn't until recently) it is the connector of all connectors. A SINGLE USB-C can be used to add almost dozens of different devices to your computer. A $50 hub can be plugged into a USB-C port and it can support external hard drives, internet ports, HDMI output, headphone jacks, card readers and even charge other devices. A single small USB-C port makes your laptop able to connect to so many more devices. Without one, you limited in so many ways . The Acer Spin 3 comes with only a COUPLE of standard USB ports and a card reader, a headphone jack and an HDMI output. I am constantly trying to plug devices into my laptops and needing more ports, and the Acer Spin 3 just doesn't have many. Another interesting (good) thing about the Acer Spin 3 is that the wall wart or transformer for this computer is very small compared to most of my laptops. It is only 2.4 amps and about 45 watts, which isn't very much really. You could run this off of a good sized powerbank if you had to for a bit. I was torn on how to rank this on stars. On one hand, I am very disappointed in the limitations that the Acer 3 has on connectivity. On the other hand, it is a speedy little devil that is pretty competent at computing. If you are using this in a work environment where you need to do spreadsheets, e-mail, word processing and even photoshop type editing, it is a pretty nice machine with very respectable specs, speed and parts list. If you are looking for something super creative, where you can plug in several things like external hard drives, or drawing pads, or you want an awesome screen - you are going to be frustrated by the lack of USB-C. I'm going with four stars. It is a very good computer. But if it had even just one USB-C port, it would have been a great computer. I hope you find this review helpful. I feel like that reviews are super important on Amazon and they really help me determine if a product is worth buying or not - so I try to return the favor and leave a review that will honestly tell you whether a product is good or not. We all use products differently, so I also try to make it clear what was important to me, and hopefully that makes it easy for you to tell if you will like it too. I also think it is important for Amazon shoppers to stick together and let each other know if a product is garbage. I WILL let you know if a product isn't good, so you can avoid the hassles of returning a product or a product you lose money on. PLEASE go to my profile page and reach out to me if you have any questions. I enjoy writing reviews and try to respond to any questions about a product ASAP.

As a photographer and videographer, my work demands a lot of RAM and processing power, and that is where this PC excels. I can have Photoshop and Lightroom open at once, working back and forth between both programs, and the computer keeps up beautifully. The included rechargeable pen works with the full Adobe suite without any setup required \u2014 and it\u2019s even pressure-sensitive! Extremely handy and natural feeling. The Spin 3 IS powerful enough to edit big projects in Premiere Pro, but after a certain point, some lag becomes inevitable. Still, I am surprised it handles large files as well as it does. I usually work with extremely large 4K videos formatted in ProRes CODEC, and the Spin handles them without any programs crashing. The downside of this PC, however, is its integrated graphics card. While cheaper and more energy-efficient, an integrated GPU is a great deal slower than a dedicated GPU when it comes to video editing, gaming, and other graphics-intensive tasks. So despite its fantastic processor and RAM, the Spin is just short of being the workstation it could be. The fan also blasts much louder than any other laptop I\u2019ve used, even with just a browser and a few tabs open, and it gets pretty hot. However, despite its disadvantages, the Spin 3 remains powerful enough to work on the go, and if necessary, at least get a start on projects that can be finished on more powerful computers later. It features a beautiful touchscreen display, a good trackpad, an SD card reader, and a keyboard that feels pretty similar to older MacBooks. I would summarize it as a mid-level workstation \u2014 not quite as powerful as it could be, but more than adequate for dozens of professional tasks. I highly recommend it! There is not much to complain about."}, {"name": "X12", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "July 2, 2019", "title": "Awesome Laptop", "review_text": "I was a bit hesitant to buy based on all the \"bought\" Vine reviews.

Speed: This boy is equipped with one of the fastest ssd\u2019s available at a respectable size, 16gb of ram (a must in todays era), and a 4 core 8 thread processor. This cpu tends to score a 4787 on single threaded loads and a 13130 on multithreaded loads accourding to geekbench. \"Geekbench 4 scores are calibrated against a baseline score of 4000 (which is the score of an Intel Core i7-6600U). Higher scores are better, with double the score indicating double the performance.\" My particular machine scored a 5259 on the single threaded test and a 15849 on the multithreaded. It should also be considered that i had firefox running at the time of my tests which was utilizing around 5% of my cpu. The screen: the screen is beautiful and has amazing viewing angles as most ips panels, though when compared to my Pixio PX275H, which has a high color gambit, the colors did appear to be slightly more muted. The hinges are great when comparing it to a family members asus notebook that was bought earlier this year. Unlike the asus it doesnt lock up in odd orientations. The touch screen is responsive and the pen is adequate for light photoshop work. The pen does lack the capability for the finer details and the buttons on it lack any meaningful programability. The brightness is average. Not the brightest screen ive seen but certainly not the dullest. I used mine at about 40% in a well lit room and 60-70% in a sunlit room. Battery life: at a balanced setting and an average use case this will last about 6 hours. This time can be increased if you use the optimal battery saving options and set the gpu to prioritize battery life when the system is unplugged. The keyboard and touchpad: this keyboard feels amazing! Its nice and solid and the keys are firm and dont wiggle. The backlight is nice and crisp\u2014but not over bearing\u2014and can be turned off. The touch pad is large and responsive and handles all the gestures excellently. The finger scanner is just as fast as touch id on my iphone 6s which is nice. The io: only 2 usbs? Not even a type c? Why acer! It would be more acceptable if both usbs were 3.1 but one of the usbs is a 2.0 which has way slower speeds. (When compared to its 10gbps 3.1 brethren) That port is basically only useful for a mouse dongle. It does have a sd card reader which is nice, but it juts out too far in my opinion. It could have easily been designed to fit more snugly into the system upon viewing the interior of the system. The full size hdmi is a plus and the powerbrick for the laptop is super small. The power connector also swivels for optimal placement. Gaming: this is not a gaming machine. This machine shines brightest in its productivity workloads. The integrated graphics should be able to run most competitive games like rocket league, csgo, fortnite, and overwatch at low to medium settings. It can run minecraft with optifine at around 50fps on average with a beefy texture pack. Upgradability: the laptop is equipped with 8gb of ram soldered to the board and an 8gb stick of ddr4 ram. Acer has confirmed that this motherboard can utilize 24gb if you were to swap that 8gb stick for a 16gb. The NVME drive is relatively easy to access and swap out for a 1tb if you so wish. Theoretically you could also try adding a 2.5in drive as there is an empty bay for it. If you were to do that you would need to acquire a ribbon cable connector. I have tried one from an SP315 model with no success, but that may be due to a defective wire. I currently have ordered a cable from an SP314 model to see if i have any luck with that. I will update if im successful. I got my system on prime day for $100 off, but even at its full $800 price tag this system is tempting. You wont find all these features on another laptop at this price point. The closest thing i could find was an ultrathin at the same price by acer, but it had only 8gb of ram and no touchscreen and pen support. I would recommend this pc for your average user.

I hope engineers will improve that in later versions. - Touch screen works well, but I expected it to be wider.

A metal body would be nice (this one shows smudges and recently got a scratch although I'm not sure how since the lid was shut and the scratch was by the touchpad). I have yet to need it for anything particularly resource intensive but no issues using it for Word, PDFs, Internet, and the like. It's also not all that common that I hear it's fans go into overdrive and make a ruckus. I try to use a lap desk whenever I'm not at a desk but even when I don't, it hasn't gotten as hot as the first day when it was too hot to leave on my lap. In short, if my previous cons list had led me to only give 4 stars, I would bump it up to a 5 now, but it was a five-star purchase from the start. :) (Summary at the bottom) PROS: -This is a pretty reasonable deal when you compare to the cost of getting the same specs on other laptops. I was mainly looking at Dell and Lenovo and the best I found from them was Lenovo's 2019 Flex 6 14\". Biggest difference between the specs that mattered to me was the Lenovo only cost $750 but also only had an i5 processor. The specs that mattered to me were processor, hard drive capacity, SSD, screen resolution, size, weight, RAM, and that it was a 2-in-1. -I haven't used much more than Chrome, Adobe PDF reader and Excel yet so I haven't tried to max out computer resources but I can verify that there's no lag with normal use. Restart takes 20 seconds from hitting restart to being logged in with the fingerprint scanner. -3rd party reviews from sites like PCMag of the 2018 model complained about the keys not depressing far enough to be comfortable typing a lot. While a slightly longer keystroke would feel more satisfactory to me, it's not so shallow that I would avoid it for large quantities of writing. -FHD seems like a good resolution on a 14\" screen. HD is not considered high res these days but I doubt the improvement of a 4K screen would be worth the cost, if you could even notice a significant difference between the two screens. -My last laptop had a 15.6\" screen so it was a bit of a risk cutting down on screen space but 14\" doesn't feel cramped the way 11\" or even 13\" does. It doesn't feel small unless it's sitting right next to my old laptop. The weight savings of having a smaller laptop are definitely worth it! -It's got a plastic body but it doesn't feel flimsy or cheaply built for the most part. The few minor exceptions are in my Cons list. -Fingerprint scanner was a bonus for me. It works very nicely -Stylus is handy in tablet mode. I didn't buy the laptop for the stylus so I can't speak to it's quality but I was able to make some fun art messing around in Inkscape with it. I don't know how it would work for professional-level art since the limiting factor for me is that I'm still pretty new to Inkscape. CONS: -Doesn't have the 12-hour battery life they advertise but then again, what laptop ever has the full capacity advertised? I would guess it's actually around 6-8 hours, which is still pretty reasonable. Tip: look up Acer's recommendations for battery charging before you set it up. I know it's important to go through a few full charge cycles when you first get it to extend the battery life but I forget the details of their recommendation. -It does get hot and use the fans at full speed pretty easily. The vents are on the bottom of the laptop and along the hinged edge whereas my last laptop had them on the left edge so with this one, I can almost guarantee you'll want to set it on a lap desk or large book rather than directly on your lap if you're going to be using it for a longer sitting. I'll probably eventually get a lap desk with cooling fans built in. That said, there's only been a couple times the fans have gotten noisy when it wasn't on my lap and when I moved it off my lap after it got too hot to be comfortable, it cooled down very quickly. -The charging plug is surprising small - probably to help keep the laptop thin. I don't mind that but it still has a lot of wobble to it when it's plugged in so my preference is to unplug it again once the battery is fully charged. -Indoors with a room well-lit by ambient daylight, having the brightness at about 65% is comfortable for me. This doesn't leave a lot of buffer to amp it up outside in the sun but I'm not surprised that's not what laptops are designed for. -Same with the volume - max volume was comfortable if not a bit quiet outdoors but if I wanted to broadcast music outside, I'd use a portable speaker anyways. In the home, I haven't felt the need to max out the volume though. -There's a couple rubber feet and you can see some of the places the screen clips into the frame, which gives it a bit cheaper aesthetic but nothing major. I'll probably get used to it. -Bezel along the top and sides is reasonable but it's pretty thick along the bottom - probably 3/4\" of visible case, which makes sense because of the hinges, but then another 1\"+ of glossy black before the screen actually starts. The only thing in that space, at least externally, is the Acer logo. The result is it makes the task bar look really far up. -Probably the thing I dislike the most is that the casing used for the 360 hinges has a see-your-reflection-in-it type of shiny surface. Maybe it's just personal taste but it makes them look like cheap plastic. It's also annoying when I'm in a room with low lighting and they catch the glare from a lamp behind me. SUMMARY: It has some quirks I don't care for but I bought it mainly for the processing power and portability. More money would probably fix the quirks but thanks to other reviews, I wasn't surprised by any of them."}, {"name": "Darin C.", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "July 1, 2019", "title": "Great Power For The Price", "review_text": "I was surprised by the actual power this thing had.

The only complaint I have is that it feels a little flimsy so you will need to use it with a bit more caution. I will be looking for a hard case for transporting it to class. This thing should definitely do everything a college student will need it to. Update: About a month in and it's still pretty quick. It's slowed down maybe a little with some of the programs I've been adding and running. I have the drive set to defragment everyday so that helps. I am still pretty well happy with it. I do wish it were a little more sterdy. They plastic bows quite a bit and it makes me nervous transporting it as often as I do for college.

I notice a fan running often, but did not look into that much yet. The Spin part, the convertible, is a nice feature.  I like using tent or tabletop mode (keyboard facing down) and the touchscreen is pretty responsive with my finger or a stylus.  I actually like having the SD card reader instead of using a dongle.  Like the fingerprint reader that lives in the touchpad.  Interesting placement, but works well. Two things I would change--a USB C for either charging or adapters.  Also another USB C instead of the USB 3.0.  Luckily I got a good StarTech USB to HDMI adapter for my second monitor (don't install their software, it will eventually recognize!), but it would've been nice to save $50.

The worse part was that they didnt fix the computer well! Now a part of the touchpad doesnt work correctly. Another thing to take into consideration is that the touchscreen is made out of a cheap material, therefore it bends with little effort.

In the past I've resorted to using one computer for professional work and one for personal but cheap computers are horrid things. I've bought a couple Acers in the past - chromebooks - basically to keep family out of my \"real\" computers. Frankly, that was what I was expecting again - another Acer that would be used for small family chats and other miscellaneous. I was pleasantly surprised to encounter a light weight, very versatile and downright peppy performance on this new model. First the good - out of the box this can be turned on and set-up. Cortana literally talks you through the process and it takes just a few minutes. Add a couple more for syncing with other accounts and you are done. The built in stylus is responsive and sensitive as is the touch screen capacity. The fingerprint security is terrific - works very well. This comes pre-loaded with some junk and games that I have no interest in so cannot comment on that but also has basic office software and the Microsoft/Google Edge. Initially I had no intent on using it but curiosity got the best of me and once again, I was pleasantly surprised. While I'm not sure I'll continue to use Edge, it's worth checking out. Meanwhile I downloaded my normal browsers and set-up a few other features...transfer rates were excellent as were launch/use. Everything is zippy - no major lag times encountered anywhere. The keyboard is comfortable but much to my surprise, this is so versatile that I found myself using the touch screen and voice instructions frequently. I absolutely love the ability to swap it around to type/work on a paper then switch to tablet mode while reading. Normally I work with dual monitors and often have a laptop beside me but this felt natural and able to switch naturally. Resolution looks good whether reading or launching a movie - I spent some time playing around with various media files and again, fast uploads and downloads, good picture.

It is fast and the touch screen is great.  The negatives:  battery life is about 6 hours and the fingerprint reader has not worked for me since day 3. I really do like this Acer Spin 3 2-in-1 laptop.  The combination of the 8th generation i7 processor, 16gb of ram and the 512 Solid State Drive make this machine very fast and I have yet to bog it down.  It is a lot faster than my desktop computer, which is about 2 years old and has 12 gb of ram and a standard 1tb hard drive.  The integrated graphics card is basic and would not be useful for a person that does a lot of video editing or hardcore gaming, neither of which I do.  The backlit keyboard works well. The 14 inch screen is exactly what I was looking for because a 15.6 would be to big for me to carry around daily and a 13.3 seemed a touch small.  I have watched many videos on the 1080p HD screen and it looks great, but then again it is only 14 inches so even 720p or possibly 480p would look good on this size.  The touch screen works great, I have had zero issues with it. The laptop has all of the connections I require, but it would have been nice if it had a USB-C.  When I purchased the laptop I knew it did not have a USB-C, so I fine with that.  The other outstanding specs in this machine were more important to me. Regarding battery life, so far the best I have really done is about 6 hours or half of which the manufacture claimed.  Unfortunately, half the battery life is par for the course when it comes to laptops.  Also the thumb print reader only worked for a few days even though I cleaned it.  Luckily I have been able to login with my PIN, but one day I did have an issue that said my PIN was not valid.  A restart of the computer appeared to fix that issue. All-in-all it is a nice laptop that performs well.  I want to rate it 5 stars, but due to the thumb print reader and battery life I am giving it 4 stars.  I would purchase this 2-in-1 again.

Even the material is not metal, the feel of the laptop is great with glossing casing from plastics. The speakers are nice for general youtubes. There are some cons for the laptop. First,  the screen is not as sturdy and it could easily get itself down when you walk with the computer. I expect the problem could get worse through time. Second, the fan noise is louder than a general ultrabook, but could result from the high cpu speed of this computer. However, for general light work such as MS Word, Youtube, and Chrome, the computer stays quiet. You should update the BIOS driver from July to mitigate this issue. Third, if you want to use the external 4K monitor, the HDMI is version 1.4 not 2.0. Thus you have only 30HZ refreshing rate, which is quite slow. There no display or usb c type port to resolve this.

My demands aren\u2019t terribly heavy \u2014 no serious gaming or rendering, just light CAD and software development alongside the usual browsing and Internet usage \u2014 and this machine fits the bill nicely. I haven\u2019t used Windows machines much at all for many years, but I wanted to try Windows 10 and the 2-in-1 form factor, so non-touch laptops were out. Cheaper 2-in-1\u2019s are surely available, but the i7 CPU, good-sized SSD, and 16GB of RAM, along with good experiences I\u2019ve had with Acer machines in the past, led me to this machine. I\u2019ve found it really pleasant to use and have found myself picking it up often for casual use. With Windows 10, it switches effortlessly between laptop and tablet modes, handling both portrait and landscape mode automatically. I didn\u2019t know how well direct screen touch would work with Windows apps, since most of them were designed with a mouse in mind, but modern apps like Microsoft News work nicely with big fingers. I also appreciate the fact that the system didn\u2019t come with a lot of extra junk apps installed. Although I\u2019m not a gamer, I have fond memories of the Mechwarrior series of games, so I installed Mechwarrior Online on the Spin. It was playable, but a little sluggish; I think I\u2019d get frustrated with its responsiveness in a pitched battle. Older games seem to work pretty well, so if you want to revisit some classics from GOG.com, for example, the Spin will serve well. The only nits I\u2019d pick are the lack of a thumb relief notch to make opening the lid easier and the fact that the machine\u2019s a bit heavy for tablet-style browsing. The fingerprint reader requires more than one try pretty often, and of course, one could always use more battery life. But I\u2019m really pleased with this machine, and although my MacBook Pro is still my primary device, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend the Spin to anyone with similar needs\u2026 it\u2019s a great value."}, {"name": "ckng60060", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "July 18, 2019", "title": "Fantastic laptop", "review_text": "The laptop arrived yesterday, and setting up was easy.

Barbosa", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "August 21, 2019", "title": "Sturdy and reliable.", "review_text": "I have been using this laptop for a month. First, the laptop arrived in excellent conditions. No scratches, no missing parts. It boots up very quickly, indeed. After turning it on for the first time, it required me to provide few information and, after about five minutes it was fully configured. Then, I updated the base language to my native language, which took another twenty minutes or so. After that, I have been using it without problems, except a few snags. I will explain it below. 1- Screen and touchscreen \u2013The screen is bright, clear, swiftly responsive upon touch and accurate. The rim around the screen is very thin, making it looks like the screen occupies the whole facing plate. Tablet mode switch window automatically pops-up when the screen is flipped over. The screen plate hinge built is sturdy. It seems to me it will be able to do the job flipping over and over for a long time. Pen is also accurate (Added on 11/20/2019 - I mean, fairly accurate. A small four points star reflects the contact point of the pen when it touches the screen exactly underneath. However, if you lift up the pen tip from the screen, just a few millimeters, and moves the pen around without contact, you will notice that the star indicating the pen tip position underneath falls behind and takes a while to update the exact position.) 2 - Core i7 CPU, 16 Gb RAM, 512 Gb SSD set - Very nice. CPU-Z version 1.89.1x64 rates the CPU as 1605.1 for multi thread and 358.8 for single thread. (multithread ratio 4.47), running Norton antivirus, MS OneDrive and MS Defender in background. Number of USB ports (2.0 and 3.1, type A one of each) is Ok for me. There is one HDMI 1.4b port and one SD card reader port. Double antenna ac WiFi, Bluetooth. 3 - Battery life - Using factory settings, it will certainly last between 4 h and 6 h. Adjusting battery settings to economy mode, Intel Graphics Control Panel to maximum battery autonomy, dimming screen brightness to minimum, turning off both Bluetooth and location (GPS) facility, and keeping the keyboard backlight on, battery will probably last between 10 h and 12 h (Battery gauge indicates remaining charge for 10 h at 94 %). When using it continuously for text writing and internet surfing, it will probably last up to 8 h. Turning keyboard backlight off will make it last a little longer, perhaps. 4 - Keyboard \u2013 This is the reason I gave it 4 stars (and stated almost flawlessly, above). I would have given 4.5 if it would be possible. The keyboard is backlit, which is very good. It dims off automatically a few seconds after the last hit, and turns light on as one types. It can also be permanently turned off, if necessary. Fingerprint sensor works Ok and activates the laptop swiftly. I had to relearn the positions of arrows, page up/down. In addition, home/end functions are only accessible via pressing simultaneously Fn & pgup/pgdn, which has been tricky since I started using it. The point is that the experience offered by Spin 3 keyboard typing makes me feel like the keys are not exactly loose, but not so tight either. Sometimes, it duplicates the character when I press the key once, like 'nn', 'aa', 'rr', 'ee', and 'oo'. As I type quickly, now and then I must come back, erase the character typed in double, and retype the word again (as I am doing it right now). (Added on 11/17/2019 - In my opinion, the problem escalates here when I type a password to enter an account. This double typing glitch may cause unwillingly [as it really does few times] password errors. In a plausible scenario where you are about to register an website account and enter the password for the first time, if a mistyping happens then, you will have to rescue your password ahead, at least.) I think this a chronic problem. This is my second ACER laptop. The first one, Aspire V5 touchscreen core i5, I bought it five years ago is overall working fine, by the way (Refer to a review I have made of Acer Aspire V5). The issue is that key pressing results in double tying in Aspire V5 as it does in Spin 3. However, Spin 3 typing experience has improved in relation to Aspire V5. Mouse-pad is Ok and fingerprint sensor works fine. Overall, I am glad about my acquisition, and I think this has been an excellent laptop for the price. Keyboard needs to improve.

I just bought this yesterday and got it today. It was one day shipping woo! I bought this laptop to be able to play games, do my homework and just browse.

The back light on the keyboard is an awesome feature too. It stays on while typing which is nice. The touch screen is fantastic! I used the stylus that comes with the computer (Thank you for adding a stylus with this laptop!!) and I had no issues tapping and scrolling. It does bend backwards to can use it in tablet mode. Battery life is great as well. No complaints so far. It came with a fully charged battery which was awesome too. Now for my GAMERS out there! I play Roblox (don't judge me lol) and I wanted to see how this computer will run a game that I like to play on my Xbox. This game has a LOT of stuff to load and it loaded everything very fast! The graphics are superb and I was able to plug in my Xbox one controller with no issue as well. I haven't tried playing like any heavy duty games like COD. I don't play that Fortnite mess, so don't ask lol. I do not plan on putting any major games on since again I have an Xbox which has my COD games and other stuff.

First things first, the touch screen works great. Super responsive. Same with the stylus. The only thing I don\u2019t like about the stylus is...it\u2019s a little small. Someone with big hands might find it hard to work with. But other than that, it\u2019s good. The 14 inch screen is a good size. I don't feel like it needs to be any bigger or smaller, just right. The fingerprint reader works like a charm. Sometimes it will have trouble picking up your fingerprint, but with some slight readjustments it works fine. The mousepad is great and I\u2019ve encountered no problems with it thus far. I\u2019ve had this laptop for several months and these are my TWO BIGGEST GRIPES. One: the battery life. I bought this laptop for school and the biggest thing that stands out is the BATTERY LIFE. DO NOT LISTEN to what Acer or Amazon says. This laptop does NOT get 12 hours of battery life. If that is a big deal for you, then please look for another laptop. I would say it can get 6-8 hours of battery life, 8 if you\u2019re pretty lucky. Now please note I have never run a battery test on this laptop, this is just coming from my personal experience. IF you\u2019re buying this laptop for school, then I wouldn\u2019t worry about. I have never had to use this for more than a couple hours at a time, so, personally, I don\u2019t think the battery life is too bad. My SECOND gripe is...it feels cheap. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the specs for this laptop at this price range are insane (btw, please don\u2019t expect to do hardcore gaming on this, it will drain the battery, look elsewhere if you want a gaming laptop), but it just...feels cheap. It\u2019s made of this cheap-feeling plastic (excluding the screen of course), which makes it feel like it will get completely destroyed after one drop on hard concrete. Now, notice I said cheap-FEELING. I have no clue what this thing can with stand or what it\u2019s made of, I\u2019m just telling you that, in my opinion, it feels cheap. However other than these two complaints, everything feels great. It super quick and snappy and have encountered very little problems with it. It spins around and works just fine when putting it into tablet mode, (though I don\u2019t use this mode that often myself). Keyboard is good, love the backlighting. Not too loud, and I don\u2019t feel that it gets that hot, (but I haven\u2019t been doing intense stuff with it at the same time). Again, idk what suits you personally but for me, the ports are fine. All I find myself using is the USB, HDMI, headphone jack, and charging port (obviously). I don\u2019t feel that it takes that long to charge, maybe a couple hours. Before I wrap this up, one final (small) gripe I have to talk about is the speaker. I\u2019m not a tech-savvy person (as you probably noticed) so I couldn\u2019t tell you what exactly is wrong with the speaker. It just feels...mediocre. It\u2019s not the worst I\u2019ve ever heard but it\u2019s nowhere close to being the best. It\u2019s just...ok. Certainly not a deal breaker for this laptop though. In conclusion, this is an AMAZING laptop for its price with a few issues (battery life, plastic, speaker), but honestly, every laptop has its problems.

When I got accepted to the university of London. One of the first things I was told I needed was a laptop. Not just any PC; but a laptop. So immediately I was looking for something that's easy to move around with because of my busy life and also that has a stylus for running thru PDFs on Microsoft edge and highlighting as I go through tons of cases. This PC proves to be excellent. I will say it is NOT A LIGHT WEIGHT PC. At about 4lbs you can definitely tell when it's in hand. But I would brush that off when I consider I Got a pc with the specs of the latest flagship of other companies for 600USD less. I don't need a thunderbolt. So I didn't see the need to spend the extra 100USD to have it and the present usb 3.1 port fast charges my phone.  A plus for me. Also the screen is remnant of a 2014 flagship.  It's better than my iPad mini 1. But shows significantly less radience/saturation in colors than on my Samsung Galaxy Note 9.  It's somewhere in the middle. As it's for school and not graphic design I'm not bothered. I'd advise that if u have to use it for precise editing that you connect it to an external monitor as it does have the POWER needed for most intermediate work and an external screen won't cost much. I think Acer built this pc with what is needed for professionals and students alike and as such. There is no competition when considering \"bang for buck\".  My disclaimer is. Know why you are buying this pc and it will be perfect. As I stated. I am a student. And as such. It gets the job done and then some. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udfff \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udfff.

The wifi chip included on the laptop I received was not comparable with my wifi provider. After 1-10 minutes of use of the laptop my modem and my router would \"crash\" and turn off. Therefore having all of my household devices disconnected from the wifi for about 2 minutes while my modem and router turn back on. I've never had this problem happen before until I bought this laptop. The issue happened right out of the box. I checked for updates and went through their IT support for about 5 times doing various things, but they couldn't fix it. At the end they told me to call my wifi provider and ask if it was comparable, I've never heard of this issue before so I decided to return the product. For the good. It was an amazing laptop other than the wifi issue. I thought it was amazing as of what you get for this price. It took like 2-4 seconds to turn on from shut down, and everything else seemed to have worked fine. The only downside I had was the graphics card, but it wasn't a problem since it isn't a gaming laptop.

First off, the shipping done by Amazon was not all that great. There wasn\u2019t even done bubble wrap or air packets to safeguard the package. Coming to the laptop, first impressions were good. I opened the laptop screen and voila. Three big issues, 1) The laptop display panel was coming out from the laptop lid so much so that the backlight and everything was visible (see attached image for reference). 2) One of the display hinges (right hand side) had already gone kaput. It\u2019s alignment was off and the display was swinging back and forth without any adjustment being done. 3) The touch pad was a nightmare. Not sure if it was just my laptop or if it\u2019s the same with all Acer Spin 3s - the touchpad kept getting depressed for every touch when in reality it should actually get depressed that much only while clicking. The fact that the touchpad surface wasn\u2019t all that great by itself wasn\u2019t helping matters. The whole laptop (construction and quality of a materials used) felt a little cheap and plasticky. Didn\u2019t read this on any other reviews so I thought I\u2019d mention this - the power button is placed very weirdly on the left side of the laptop towards the front. Quite an odd position and not very comfy either to use. PROS - I used the laptop for a couple hours and the battery life seems to be good. Did some heavy browsing and a little bit of spreadsheet work and the little thing did not have any trouble handling the workload. In the end, I ended up returning the laptop. On the lookout for something better now."}, {"name": "Cory Whitney", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "November 14, 2019", "title": "Great laptop for Designers", "review_text": "This laptop is more than powerful enough to run the Adobe software I have tried so far which was Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere. I have had this laptop for over a month now and it has been very useful and I haven't really had a problem with it. Everything works great for what I need it for but that can vary for each person. I have had good experience with performance, the fingerprint scanner, touch screen, etc. The one thing I wish they would add is a few pads or something around the keyboard for when you have the keyboard face down on a desk or table. I love how you can fold it up backwards but the area around the keyboard scratches easy. If you do buy this product it would be a good idea to set the laptop on something soft if you plan on using it keyboard down. The battery life doesn't last 12 hours as they say but that goes for a lot of things you buy. I have had a good battery experience and it does not lack in this area. I can't really say how long the battery lasts because it depends on what you are doing. If you are browsing the internet then it should last a while but if you are running a more powerful program then it will go down faster. Overall, this laptop has proved its worth so far. If you are thinking about getting a laptop I would highly recommend this one. I am rating this 4/5 stars because of how easy it is to scratch and how the battery doesn't last 12 full hours on a regular use (it still lasts long, just not as long as they say without turning on battery saver, having the brightness down, etc.)"}, {"name": "Janet", "rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "July 27, 2019", "title": "LOUD computer", "review_text": "I like the weight, price and functionality of the laptop but when they said it was loud, I didn't think it was LOUD.

So far, I\u2019m impressed with the amount of value Samsung brought to this device. The N3060 processor is perfectly suitable for my daily tasks. This Chromebook is able to stream 1080p/60fps videos, load ad/image-heavy websites relatively fast, multitask without slowdown, and run Android apps/games well. For example, 3d games such as Max Payne, GTA San Andreas, and Star Wars KOTR from the Google Play Store are perfectly playable at their default settings (If you\u2019re wondering about the controller, the DualShock 3 is compatible with this model). As for the general build quality, I have no complaints. The spill-resistant keyboard is comfortable to type on, the mousepad is responsive, and the design of this laptop both looks and feels more premium than the price suggests. The only downside I have for this laptop is the screen. Compared with my old Chromebook, the Acer Chromebook 11 (2016), it\u2019s no contest. The IPS screen on the Acer Chromebook has much better viewing angles and the colors are more saturated. That being said, I wouldn\u2019t say that the screen on the CB3 is bad. The colors are decent when you find an optimal viewing angle and the anti-reflective screen is well suited for brightly-lit environments. You can tilt the screen about 30 degrees outside of the optimal viewing angle before the colors get washed out. Also, I've had no issues running this Chromebook through my 1080p monitor. In the future, the Samsung Chromebook 3 will have Linux support with Crostini. Currently, you can switch this Chromebook to the Canary channel to test this feature out. Unfortunately, I was unable to get Linux to work because of mounting issues. Hopefully Google will get this feature ironed out in the future, since having 64gb of storage is optimal for installing a plethora of Linux apps. To conclude this review, I\u2019d recommend this Chromebook to anyone that wants to install both Linux apps (either with crouton or crostini) and Android Apps on their Chromebook. Having 50gb of usable internal storage makes this Chromebook an excellent device to use both online and offline. Pros 1. Decent processor with 4gb of RAM 2. Anti-glare screen 3. Comfortable keyboard and responsive trackpad 4. Less than $300 5. 8-10 hours of battery life 6. Google Play is supported and Crostini (Linux apps inside Chrome OS) is coming in the near future. Cons 1. Colors get washed out when the screen is tilted out of optimal range. 2. Quiet speakers *Update - 1.5 months later* The Samsung Chromebook 3 officially supports Crostini Linux in the beta channel. Even though I initially had a few issues getting the terminal to install on this Chromebook, Linux apps work quite well. For example, the Libre Office suite (a Linux substitute for Microsoft Office) works very well and I haven't experienced any crashes with it. The same thing can be said for Filezilla, Gimp photo editor, and GnuCash. However, if you're using Linux apps that rely on sound and video/graphics (Spotify desktop, VLC Media Player, watching videos through Firefox, games with Steam), the performance is quite laggy and all of these apps have audio problems (scratchy audio or none at all). Therefore, it still has a long ways to go when it comes to replacing a dedicated Linux distro. If you're interested with a smoother Linux experience with this Chromebook, I'd recommend installing Gallium OS and dual boot it with chrx. I was able to get Counter Strike GO playable through steam (at very-low graphics) and the rest of the apps I've had problems with in Crostini worked in Gallium."}, {"name": "Kacey Lauren", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "October 18, 2018", "title": "Definitely a good little machine for the price!", "review_text": "So, I'm going to be comparing this Chromebook with the really well rated Asus Flip.  I wouldn't have changed, except for the fact that the screen on my Flip cracked when I was bumped into and dropped my backpack. Pros: It just looks more expensive/high end. The Asus Flip, in my opinion, looks cheap. This laptop looks like a sleek little machine. The screen is sharper and the colors are brighter. Nearly $80 cheaper for the same specs. The Flip has a touch screen, sure, but not a very good one. I constantly found it registering touches all the way across the screen from where I touched. The hinge feels very durable, far more durable than the Flip. The Flip hinge wobbled every time I even used the touchscreen. Touchpad flows a lot better and it's slightly bigger. HDMI port, SD card port, and 2 USB-A ports. Good enough! Cons: The keyboard is noticeably smaller, so I find myself making a few typing mistakes. I'm sure this will go away as I use the laptop more and more. The charger!!! Really, Samsung? A unique charger in this day and age? It was so nice to only have to carry one charger for my phone, laptop, and Switch (USB-C for all 3). This laptop has a unique charger and it's really irksome. The future is USB-C, and I'm not sure why Samsung refuses to jump onboard. Like other reviews have said, it does get smudgy. I would invest in a skin or a hard snap on case. Overall, for the price, it is great. I bought this in a pinch because my Flip screen is totally destroyed from the drop and I'm a college student who needs a laptop. I would definitely recommend this laptop over the Flip."}, {"name": "Jessi Kalenda", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "September 27, 2018", "title": "Good for school!", "review_text": "It's light and simple.

Imagine an average screen quality with poorly applied protective plastic film left on, that's almost as bad as this.

Lafferman", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "November 27, 2018", "title": "It Definitely Has Its Issues", "review_text": "I love Samsung products.  I had a Samsung Microwave.  I have a Samsung 10.1\" Tablet, & I have a 32\" Samsung Flat Panel Tv.  I rarely if ever have had any issues with any of their products, until now. The picture screen on this Samsung Chromebook at 11.6\" is barely larger than my Samsung 10.1\" Tablet.  If you are used to having and using a standard sized laptop, you will be in for a shock with this, at how small it is. Mine came with a Quick Start Guide & Warranty Booklet, but the Owners  Manual, which you can download the PDF here on the product page, or thru Samsung.com, it's literally 73 pages long!  I called Tech Support, was told they could mail it to me, then was told they couldn't.  No Owners Manual should be 73 Pages long for ONE language! Over the course of 3 days I have called Samsung Tech Support 4 times.  They seem knowledgeable, but all have very strong accents, if you live in the U.S.A., which makes things more difficult when dealing with a new product, to explain your issue. My biggest issue is when it comes to printing.  Forget about Click & Print!  I have a Brother All In One Printer, less than a year old.  I had to call both Brother Tech Support, as well as Samsung Tech Support, so that I could print.  I have an entire page of handwritten notes just to print!  I doubt I can scan, etc.  It uses both the I CLOUD Beta Printing, as well as my Brother All In One to print.  Unlike both my Android Tablet & Android Phone, where all I had to do was get the Brother Plug In App through The Google Play Store, and could either download or print, etc. With this Samsung Chromebook you have to basically download and save the document, but then there are about 6-8 \"this opens another window\" instructions BEFORE it actually prints whatever it is you want to print.  Way too much for what is supposed to be a fairly simple Chromebook, so you might want to think twice about buying this  if printing is important to you.  I've always had a printer with a computer. I doubt I will be using this Chromebook for printing!  I also noticed that when using Chrome for your Search that pages don't always load correctly.  I had that issue with Amazon.com. I didn't want Windows 10, and I already have a tablet, so it was suggested to me by Best Buy that maybe a Chromebook would be an option.  I am not sure that it will work for my needs, but if you are mainly buying it to check email, things like that, this will probably work fine for you. Yes it does have Google Play Store loaded on it.  There is also a Chrome Web Store. It is nice that it updates automatically when you turn it on, that there are no Windows Updates since the Operating System is Chrome, which I always thought Chrome was just a search engine, like Firefox or Internet Explorer.  No need for Mal ware or Norton either. I think the picture on this is fair, not great.  I have a sound bar attached to it for better sound. Now I am just trying to figure out if the pluses of having this Samsung Chromebook outweigh the negatives.  I haven't made up my mind yet! I purchased mine Used, Like New in Original Packaging through Amazon Warehouse on Amazon.  Normally I buy everything new when it comes to electronics, after having a bad experience with one refurbished item.  They shipped very fast, it was packaged well,  the item does look new, and after contacting Samsung with the Model # & Serial #, I found that I still had 10  months left on the One Year Warranty. FINAL UPDATE- I am returning this to Amazon, only my second purchase to return since 2001.  That's how long i have been an Amazon Customer, and A Vine Voice since 2009. In the few days that I've had it, it has been a constant source of frustration, not what I anticipated at all when I purchased it. Have had printer issues where something should print but doesn't.  I can't even get Amazon's web page to load correctly through Google Search. I thought that this Samsung Chromebook might be a good alternative for me, instead of purchasing another laptop. I really didn't want Windows 10, but I need something that can do what I need it to do, which this can't, at least not for me.  Funny thing is, I was just trying to do basic things on it- checking email, going to a web page, printing. After speaking to Samsung Technical Support once again today, I was told that Chromebooks are mainly for students, a lower cost alternative to a computer.  It was suggested to me to buy one of their larger Chromebooks.  No thanks! I am done with Chromebooks! Back to looking at laptops!  I wish that this had worked out for me.  I am sad that it doesn't.  Hopefully it will work for some of you.  I always get the bad apple in the bunch!"}, {"name": "Albert Sunseri", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "November 16, 2018", "title": "Just right for my needs", "review_text": "As a retiree, it serves me well.

Before it dies entirely; I figured it was time for a new laptop. The laptop arrived packed well - the laptop packaged in the typical fiberboard form fitting packing, in a Acer box.  This was packed in a larger box for additional protection that is typical for Amazon - it protected the laptop well. The laptop comes with a power supply and a kit that provides the cable and mounts to install a second HDD. Make sure you plug in the laptop or it will not allow the setup to commence. Cortana promptly comes up and guides you through the setup process - you can acknowledge choices via voice or mouse input. The setup process is typical Windows 10 and proceeded smoothly with no issues from start to finish.  I was up running and saving favorite websites in a few minutes! What I like: This PC has a \"SSD\" (Solid State Drive) - what this means is that the main storage is electronic (like the chip in a cell phone) - as such access times are very fast - improving the boot time (about 20 seconds!) and speed of the laptop.  An SSD is also more reliable and potentially long lived versus a \"HDD\" (Hard Disk Drive) - a failed HDD is often the end of most PCs.  This is a fantastic feature and value in an inexpensive \"budget\" PC! There are plenty of connection options available on the sides of the PC - an ethernet port, two \"standard\" USB ports, a USB C port, an HDMI port and the power connection grace the left side of this PC - another \"Standard\" USB port, a headphone jack and a place to connect a lock cable on the right side. Display is great - there is a very thin bezel that surrounds the screen - about 1/4\" on the sides and maybe 1/2\" on the top.  The display is also 1080P and very clear - I just watched a 1080p test video on YouTube and it looks fantastic!  Streaming is smooth with no lagging as well.  We have very good Wifi at our house so your performance in this area may vary.  Its also welcome to be using a larger 15\" display as it is significantly larger than the 13\" I have been using. The look of this PC is also stunning - a brushed aluminum cover with matching plastic finish elsewhere - looks clean and classy. The keyboard is also big - great for my rather large hands - the keys have a nice tactile click and are responsive. Have not used it enough to confirm battery life but assume it will be good as the SSD uses much less power than a HDD.  Also, I understand that the Intel processor is rather efficient and less power hungry than others - as with any PC - screen brightness, heavy gaming or other processor intensive activities will use the battery more quickly. What Could Improve?: The most notable shortcoming is the amount of RAM provided - 4GB.  This is really insufficient by today's standards but it is upgradeable to 16GB and for basic web surfing, watching videos, editing spreadsheets or presentations or tending to email the 4GB will still work well - remember the SSD does enhance speed and performance overall as well. A VGA port - I know that these are going the way of the dinosaur but it still is a rather common connector for older projectors or AV systems - I need one to connect to our system for presentations at work.  An inexpensive HDMI to VGA adaptor quickly solved this for me. A larger SSD would be amazing - I get it though, this is a \"Budget PC\" and the very fact that it has an SSD versus an HDD is impressive! Video chip is average - ok for watching streaming videos but assume it would struggle with heavy video editing or heavy graphics gaming - not an issue for me. Windows 10 in \"S\" mode is a hassle - does not allow you to install any program not available in the Store - I had some issues opting out of S Mode (Microsoft issue) - they resolved and I opted out in order to to install Microsoft Office 2010 - no more issues! Overall, Acer makes a great budget PC - they are generally reliable and the SSD in this model makes it a solid choice.  Highly recommend! EDIT:  I have used this laptop for about two weeks and cannot believe just how good it is!  I have had many laptops over the years - my first being a 486 based \"Gateway\" running DOS and an old version or windows along with multiple others over the years.  This is clearly my favorite!  The SSD makes for AMAZING fast boot times - from pressing the power button to reaching your desktop is achieved in under 20 seconds- crazy fast!  I just installed Microsoft office, the \"Team Viewer\" app and \"Citrix Receiver\" (allows for remote access to my office PC) & the chrome browser - my plan is to keep this laptop \"clean\" without excess programs that might slow it down.  The battery life so far has been excellent - I just charge it after several uses - hasn't been below 60% yet.  I was initially considering upgrading the RAM but have not seen the need the 4mb appears to suffice for me.  If you are on the fence about this purchase - GO FOR IT - I guarantee that you will not be disappointed! Edit#2 - 6 week update - this laptop still amazes me every day - the boot times remain crazy fast, seems that I can type faster on this keyboard than ever before - although specs seem to be \"budget\" this is clearly the best performing laptop - including Macs that I have ever used!"}, {"name": "Nick", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "July 31, 2019", "title": "Battery", "review_text": "The battery takes extremely long to charge Edit: I\u2019m an idiot the charger wasn\u2019t fully plugged"}, {"name": "J. Collins", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "August 11, 2019", "title": "Acer knocked it out of the park!", "review_text": "I've been using computers since the Intel 8088 processor hit the market via the first IBM PC...well truth be told, we came out at the same time  in June of 1979. I feel somewhat like the old man relaying how they walked to school, up hill both ways, in the snow, with no shoes on, saying this but when that device came out, it cost the equivalent of $5,000 ~ $10,000 USD today. Fast forward to 2007 when I purchased my Mac Book Pro for $2,500 to do high-end Graphic design on, with a Core 2 Duo, 2GB DDR2 RAM and 5400RPM HDD....and now....I just purchased a budget buy of a PC that puts them both utterly to shame. I say these things because it has a large bearing on the decision to purchase this laptop. I just finished repairing and upgrading my mother in laws laptop from 2011 that cost more than this but had now where near the performance, even for it's time. Granted, this is not a gaming PC as it does not have a dedicated graphics card but it has enough to push the envelope of what we consider a budget PC. Also worth noting is that this laptop is a replacement for my Dell M6700 workstation laptop that got murdered by lightning. The 8th gen i3 is only half of the overall power of the i7 that was in my M6700. But! the \"Single Thread Rating\" of the newer i3 is significantly better...and let's face it, even many of the graphic design tasks I do are really only single threaded applications. So, all that extra power was usually not even being tapped. My CPU was usually only at 25% doing HD renderings in Blender. That's definitely worth considering when buying a device, what are the needs of your tasks? If they are single thread tasks, like most non gaming tasks, then an i3 performs quite well, so long as you don't over multi-task by running to many applications at once. It's got DDR4, which is an obvious advantage over DDR3 systems. But even systems that cost more than twice as much are being sold with 5400RPM HDDs. There are very significant performance differences between SSD and HDD systems and the fact that this laptop comes with NVMe drive, which outperforms both SSD and HDD, gives it a solid edge over other budget PCs. Being only 4GB of RAM can be concerning, especially for things like photo and video editing...but I used to do that with 2GB or RAM and it is easily upgradable to 20GB. 128GB of storage is not a lot either by today's standards, but for $50 yo can add in a decent 2TB HDD for storage...i just so happened to already have one because of my  system that died. I also redirect my Desktop, Downloads and Documents to the secondary drive to help keep the OS drive clean...worth Google-ing to do yourself. The display is great! it was important to me to get something that is Full HD 1080. I was very near to buying something in the tablet range just because most laptops in this class are only 1366 x 768. it is also not glossy, which I rather prefer. In most cases, glossy screens create in consistent results because of reflecting too much of the environment. It is also very thin and light weight. This was a very important factor since my M6700 was twice has heavy and twice as thick. Overall, I'd say this laptop is the perfect balance of budget pricing with mid level performance."}, {"name": "Thunderbird66", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "September 1, 2019", "title": "Noisy", "review_text": "Purchased this computer and thought Wow this is fantastic.

I want to love this laptop. I have run Ubuntu Linux on it along with Windows 10. Even with only 4GB RAM and 128GB eNVM it is very usable. It does have a serious flaw. The touchpad has a problem with recognizing a single finger tap verses a double tap. Quite often it will recognize a single tap as a double tap. Sometimes it will not recognize a single finger tap at all. Even with pressing down to make it click. Working in a application like a browser you can deal with it. While coding or writing in multiple documents it is unusable. I will fiddle with the sensitivity and toggling off some touchpad features, but this about to be sent back. In addition, it appears Acer manufacturing has changed this A515-54 model to no longer have two DDR4 RAM slots and a spare SSD connection. Instead it has one spare DDR4 RAM slot and no additional storage connections. This makes the Aspire 5 line less interesting with a max 20GB instead of 32GB RAM and no upgrade options for storage. I am disappointed. I really wanted to love this laptop. Instead I am likely to return it and seriously consider other manufacturers. Updated: I figured out the touchpad cannot handle a tap or touch within a inch or two for dragging or selecting. Almost has to be click bottom and drag from top. Usable now I know the quirk.

It has some nice features, some missing features, and one glaring negative issue for me. Acer is of course a good brand. They've been making great laptops for years. What's included: - The Laptop - The power cord and brick - Paperwork including a brief Setup Guide - A hard disk (or SSD) adapter frame and HDD ribbon cable. Design, and Construction This is a good looking modern laptop. It has an all plastic and has a plastic feel but I do think it will hold up well. The back of the screen is aluminum. The laptop is about 4 pounds which is about average for this class of laptop. The laptop is also reasonably thin and would easily slip into a backpack. The edges are smooth, fan sound is not too loud, opening and closing requires a fingernail as there is no slot to grab. The screen clarity is great and has a wide viewing angle. The track pad is responsive. Features Keyboard feel keyboard is nice to type on (I'm a touch typist). Shift and enter keys are in the right place and of the standard size. The small numeric keyboard will please some. The backlight keyboard has only on/off, no levels of brightness. The backlighting stays on for about 30 seconds, then shuts off to save battery power. I consider a backlit keyboard a requirement and it's good to see this computer includes that feature. Ports - One USB 3.1 port type C. This greatly expands some of the features of the laptop including the ability to charge a phone from the laptop, or charge the laptop from an external battery. - Two USB 3.0 ports - One USB 2.0 port. - HDMI Port - 802.11ac WiFi - Bluetooth 5.0 - Gigabit Ethernet - Webcam Performance I ran streaming video from youtube which worked well. The speakers, at full volume, are just okay for a quiet environment. The sound was clear but the volume was limited. Given the options of using the 3.5mm headphone jack, or Bluetooth speakers/headphones, I didn't consider this a big issue. After upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Home, I loaded the powerful photo editor Acdsee Pro 7 64 bit and it performed quickly while editing a 24megapixel photo. I did notice a slight reduction in speed compared to my desktop but that is to be expected. The speed of photo editing was quite acceptable. Could not run Chrome browser in S mode. Upgradeability  The RAM can be updated max 20GB. I left it at 4GB. I was intrigued by the included hard drive adapter and cable. It captured my attention that there might be space for a hard drive so I stopped everything else and looked into it. I opened the back, located a spare 256GB SSD I had and installed it. I needed help from ACER youtube video to install the HDD cable. Once physically installed it just worked! There is now 256GB of extra storage, assigned as a D drive, which I think makes a major difference. Now there is room for some real programs and data. Computer seems a little laggy but not bad. It wasn't slow enough to be a bother. My other computer is a quite fast desktop to compare with. Operating System The computer comes loaded with Windows 10 S which is a restricted ability operating system. It restricts the ability to load any other programs than those available in the Microsoft Store. It also makes Microsoft Edge the default, and only, browser I can use. I couldn't even load the Chrome browser let alone try to run it. Only those apps in the Microsoft Store can be loaded and used. Perhaps this would be okay with you in which case go ahead and buy this computer. For me Windows 10 S is completely unusable. I don't use any Microsoft apps, but I do use quite a few other programs that won't run under Windows 10 S. Microsoft says Windows 10 S is faster and more secure than Windows 10 Home and other programs that could then be loaded. I'm sure if you don't load large powerful programs, and you load less apps, the computer can run faster. But it is still the same processor, RAM, and storage either way. I'm not so sure the marketing for Windows 10 S tells the true story. One of the first things I attempted to do was upgrade from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Home. I checked several web sites which gave instructions on how to do that. But every site gave instructions that didn't match this laptop. It seems the wording and process have recently been changed. I was unable to find a straight forward means of doing the upgrade. I spoke with both Microsoft and ACER who told me I would have to purchase Windows 10 Home. That would more than $100 to the cost of bringing this computer up to a reasonable performing laptop. Finally what did work was I loaded a copy of the photo editor I use on the laptop. When I completed that step the laptop had somehow automatically updated from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Home. Finally all of my programs, Quicken, TurboTax, the photo editor, a video editor, Family Tree Maker, and others will now load and run. Pros: - Good list of ports including USB 3.0 and USB C - Good display with wide viewing angles - Nice keyboard that I find easy to type on - Backlit keyboard - Bluetooth 5.0 - 802.11ac wireless - Stated 9.5 hours of battery run time - Aluminum screen back - Can be upgraded with a 7mm HDD or SSD. Cons: - No touch-screen. We have a desktop computer and two other laptops. The desktop does not have a touch screen and I'm not tempted to use my finger on the non-touch screen monitor. However our phones, tablets in the family, and the laptops all have touch screens. Every time I use this ACER laptop I'm tempted to touch the screen but alas it isn't a touch-screen display. This is my biggest complaint about this laptop. - Small storage. Only 128GB would have seemed like a lot five years ago, or on one of today's cell phones. But for a laptop this is so small I would likely run out of space in less than a year. There is only one drive so it has also to contain the Windows Operating System, all applications, and all user data. - Windows 10 S. Microsoft would call this a good feature, touting the added security of running only Microsoft Apps. But I have no use for any of the Microsoft Apps. I use programs that run in desktop mode. All of my programs are large and powerful, unlike the smaller limited feature Microsoft Apps. - When running in Windows 10 S mode only the Microsoft Edge browser can be used. Other browsers such as Chrome cannot be loaded or run. - Slower i3 processor which is to be expected in this price range. Still it seems to perform well. - No memory card reader (would have to carry an adapter dongle). I use a lot of SD and microSD cards so this is an issue for me. - Plastic laptop case Conclusion The bottom line is if you are considering laptops of this low cost there has to be trade-offs. In some cases features you desire can be added but then it may actually be cheaper to buy a slightly more expensive laptop which has the features you want. For casual use such as searching the internet, Facebook, news, weather, college reports, simple non-graphic-intensive games, and such this laptop would serve you well. For heavy duty use such as graphic intensive games, or Video editing, you may want to look for a more powerful system."}, {"name": "Steve Rider", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "September 8, 2019", "title": "Can Be Converted to a Linux Laptop, Great Deal, Easy to Upgrade, Ideal for Kids", "review_text": "I was looking for a low cost notebook I could convert to Linux as a gift for my grandson. With EFI and Windows S it is not trivial to replace Windows but it can be done.  This comes with really good hardware and a crippled OS. My original plan was to replace the original M.2 SSD, it has been described as NVMe but I found otherwise. The EFI would not recognize my real NVMe stick. On examination the original is PCIe but not NVMe. Plan B was activated. I put a 512gb Crucial MX300 SSD in the empty bay. Acer even provided a bracket and the screws necessary in the  package. I also installed an 8gb SODIMM in the empty slot bringing it up to 12gb  total, 4gb is soldered on the motherboard. The IPS display is excellent, much better than a cheap Chromebook. There are ten identical screws on the bottom, I removed these and used a pry tool to remove the bottom cover.  Clearly Acer has intentionally made it easy to work on this, sort of an anti-Apple. In order to get it to boot from a USB stick go into the EFI  options (by pressing F2 at boot) and find the option to enable F12  selection of boot drive. I installed Ubuntu Studio 19.04 with no problems at all.  My grandson is getting a great laptop and it was not too expensive.

I immediately added an extra 8G DDR4 Ram chip to it,  for a total of 12G.;  you simply unscrew the 10 tiny screws on the backplate with a small Phillips head;  slip the backplate off and pop your new DDR4 chip into the little socket provided.  Total time?  About 12 minutes. Really,  the unit is now amazingly fast...  I haven't seen it hiccup or lag yet.  I had opted for the Intel chip version of the Aspire,  as it does have a slightly faster CPU speed.  I immediately opted-out of the Windows 10 \"S\" mode...  which literally took a few seconds to do.  I connected my high-speed internet to the unit via the Ethernet socket,  and proceeded to upgrade all the drivers and firmware for the unit.  I gave the unit a good Defrag and a Registry cleanse,  and I'm good-to-go. I mainly bought this laptop as a way to entertain myself on long airplane flights.  The unit is very light and handsome...  I am mystified by those who point out that the chassis is not more hip 'n' chic looking,  because it looks great to me.  I've also read several pro reviews online which allege that the unit is deeply flawed by a bad-looking monitor display;  I absolutely don't know what they're talking about--  the display looks amazing to me:  super-sharp and clear 1080p,  with natural-looking colors,  perfect brightness and contrast.  Fonts look sharp yet nicely antialiased.  A 15.6\" monitor is perfect real estate to view movies on while traveling,  neither too big nor too small. I will agree with the naysayers who say that the onboard speakers are not very loud,  and the sound quality is not as good as one might wish.  Yep,  those things are true,  but hey,  who expects a laptop to sound like Studio 54?  Usually one will be using headphones anyway,  right?  When watching videos on the VLC Player,  one can tweak their included graphic equalizer in order to get the optimum sound response possible. I will soon be purchasing a mouse for this unit,  as,  at age 56,  I never have gotten the hang of using a touchpad.  I am not a gamer at all,  so am not worried about the power needed to play GTA,  etc.  Although I will take a stab at doing 2D and 3D  artwork in Photoshop and Cinema 4D and see how it goes. All-in-all,  I am very pleased with this new laptop and hope to get lots of good use out of it.  At this price-point,  I don't see that you can do much better.

You are easily walked through it using either voice prompts or the mouse. I would say that the total setup took around five minutes.  The other thing that I have thoroughly tested on this laptop is, the Bluetooth. I have connected my printer, and two vinyl cutting machines to it, with no issues.

Not too much to ask for, right? The Acer Aspire 5 fit the bill. Thanks to a SSD, the full HD 15 inch display, 4GM memory and a whopping 9 hour battery life, I can get the work done that I need to do without wasting a ton of money. I have several other computers - mostly Apple computers - so the slim, modern design (reminiscent of an iPad pro) appealed to me. The solid state drive means the laptop can take a smack without crashing and it starts up super quick. Unlike SOME computers I could mention (ah hem, Apple), this computer as oodles of ports. An ethernet port, two standard USB ports, a USB C port, an HDMI port ,and the power port on the left, with another Standard USB port, a headphone jack and a place to connect a lock cable on the right. The display is excellent. No, it doesn't match up to some of the higher-end laptops, but it's very good. I can edit huge files with no trouble and watching video is awesome. The thin bezel around the screen makes the view great. The video chip is nothing to write home about it, but it's pretty good and can certainly handle the basic job. Of course, 4 GB of memory sucks. You can upgrade, and if you are only paying $300 for a laptop, what can you expect? The keyboard is freakin HUGE. It's backlit and the keys are quite separate, which is nice if you have big hands. Actually, I have small hands, and it's great for me, too. The keys have a small gap between them, making it harder to fat finger things. I'm getting about 8 hours of battery life with regular use, which is pretty good, though short of what the manufacturer claims. It takes a chunk of time to charge, but larger batteries tend to do that. Overall, I really can't complain. This is a good laptop at an amazing price.

The 1 TB HDD that it came with was terrible, but after an easy upgrade that laptop has been quick and reliable. So when I saw this new model, the A515-54-30BQ, I was very confident getting it, even though the specs seem rather modest.  This is a great looking laptop, with a nice brushed aluminum top, a backlit keyboard, and a bright 1080P display.  The 2 USB 3.1 ports and a USB C port are very nice, but I really wish there was a card reader.  It comes with 4 GB of RAM, 128GB of storage and Windows 10 in S mode.  Right out of the box, it fired up quickly and worked very well.  I'd never heard of Windows 10 S Mode, but a quick search revealed that it seems to be Microsoft's answer to the Chrome operating system.  It's a limited version of the underlying Windows OS designed to run faster, give better battery life, and provide better security.  You are limited to using the Edge browser and can only load apps from the Microsoft Store.  It's not a bad option if you use Microsoft Office 365 and OneDrive.  You can easily switch to Windows 10 Home or Pro if you're not comfortable with those limitations, but once you do there is no going back.  The Windows support page titled \"Switching out of S mode in Windows 10\" shows you how to do it for free. Knowing that I was going to be making that switch, the first thing I did was add RAM and storage.  The operating system is installed on the 128 GB NVMe SSD, so I just went the easy route of adding an additional SSD.  Acer support has published a video of the procedure on YouTube titled, \"Aspire A515-54 How to Install an Additional Hard Drive.\"  I've included pictures of the process, but you should really watch the video.  While you're in there, you might want to add some RAM.  There is 4 GB soldered to the motherboard, so whatever you plug in will be added to that.  I was able to get an additional 4 GB for less than $20. This just goes to show that the best thing about this laptop is its versatility.  Out of the box, it's a great Chromebook alternative.  The CPU, an Intel i3-8145u, is a 2 core 4 thread processor with a boost frequency of 3.90 MHz that easily beats the processors you will find in comparably priced alternatives.  For just a little more (I spent about $75 for my upgrades), you can convert it to a full-fledged Windows laptop.  I wouldn't call it a desktop replacement, but it's thin and light, easily portable, and it works great for me!"}, {"name": "Kendall B.", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "August 25, 2019", "title": "Slim and Trim but No Slacker", "review_text": "The Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop is aimed at the casual user / student who needs a little bit more power than the average tablet or bare bones, internet only laptop.

Thanks to the 15\" screen there is also room for a 10-key numeric keypad on the right side. The 15\" HD screen is a treat considering other laptops are being sold with 13\" screens for much more. It's perfect for streaming movies, TV shows. The sound from the laptop is surprisingly  crisp, clear, and full. As full as you can get with a laptop speaker in this price range. The photos show the included ports which should be fine for most applications. Other than the power cord feeling a little wiggly when plugged in to charge, the unit feels very solid.

The option to opt out of Windows S Mode is provided as a one time switch out - photos shown above.)"}]},

Nice sturdy plastic chassis. (Keeps it lightweight) 2. USB type C port, SD card slot, HDMI, and USB 3.0 3. Touchscreen with an IPS display 4. 4 gigs of RAM and 64gig of storage. (rare at this price point) 5. Nice feel to the keyboard and track pad. 6. ARM processor that is optimized for the Google play store apps and runs much better than the Intel celerons you see in most low-end Chromebooks. You get a lot for $300. You can't really find those options within that price range. The only thing I wish it had was a FHD display. 1366x768 still looks sharp on an 11.6 in screen but it would be super sharp if it was 1080p. I would highly recommend this Chromebook."}, {"name": "Josh Hartman", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "November 29, 2018", "title": "Far exceeded my expectations", "review_text": "Full disclosure, I am not an IT professional but use laptops, tablets, and desktop computers daily in my personal and work life. This chromebook has far exceeded my expectations. This is my first time using a chromebook. I have had a week or so to really dig into the device. I own an alienware gaming laptop, but I find myself only using it now for gaming purposes only. This chromebook is fast in my opinion. The speed is snappy and the device responds quickly to gestures and commands. I have yet to find sometime I can't do on this that I do on my windows laptop aside from gaming. One game I like to play requires windows, mac, or linux. Since this has an ARM processor it does not support linux applications at this time. Design: This device is a bright attractive white chromebook. I find the design to be pleasing to the eye and appears sturdy even though it is made from plastic. I do not particularly like using it in tablet mode. The screen feels bulky and sometimes unmanageable in tablet mode. The screen quickly transitions to whatever position to place it in whether laptop, tent, or tablet mode. I personal find myself not even using my LG tablet for much of anything except when I need LTE internet away from home. Overall the design is great. Screen/Input: I find the keyboard to be on par with most laptop keyboards. The keys are a little shallow and I feel my typing has slowed a little bit, but not by much. The IPS touchscreen is very responsive and rarely find myself having to touch the screen more than once for my intended gesture. Screen is bright in home conditions, but feel it would lack in more intense lighting situations, such as outdoors. Ease of Use: The google play store makes this thing be able to do just about anything. I have not tried any intense applications. I use chrome, netflix, hulu, evernote, several banking apps, and various other apps. All of them are snappy responsive. The bank apps load like they are in phone mode, thus they are in a small window. The apps still work as designed. Netflix and Hulu playback is smooth and pleasant to watch on the screen. Overall, I am impressed with the Google OS and this device in general. If your someone who is on the fence about the operating system, I suggest you give it a try. The battery life is good as well. When using my gaming laptop its always with a cord tethered nearby. I also understand a gaming laptop is far more power intensive. I have yet to use this chromebook while charging it. The battery has allowed me to watch 4-5 hours of netflix, talk on facebook, and text through my phone without ever getting critically low. I charge it at night and then never put it back on till the next night. This is a max screen brightness. I was also very surprised with the speakers. The speakers were much louder and not distorted. I honestly expected them to be cheap netbook quality that is mostly better just to never use them, but thats not the case with this chromebook. I do generally use a bluetooth headset. The bluetooth headset paired with extreme simplicity. I also set up my brother wireless laser printer with google cloud print in less than 30 seconds. Google did it right and lenovo delivered a solid product. I did purchase this on sale for $200 but would have spent the $300. If your a web surfer, music listener, netflix watcher I highly recommend this. If you need windows intense software then go with windows. Otherwise I think you'll find yourself using this as your primary device as I have."}, {"name": "Ajax", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "November 24, 2018", "title": "Not sure how I feel about this right now.", "review_text": "Brand new device, went from 64gb out the box and after the OS update i only have 49GB available. 3.7G are in use by preinstalled apps.

Better Chromebooks have Intel Core CPUs for great performance. The much cheaper Mediatek system in this Chromebook gives it mediocre performance, especially for intensive games or for business users who open lots of tabs simultaneously and frequently switch between them. On the plus side this Chromebook has a useful 4GB of RAM, a sharp colorful IPS screen, a touch screen that works great with Android apps, a very responsive (for swiping) touchpad, and reliable WiFi (much better than my HP laptop). On the minus side, the white plastic shell looks and feels a little cheap, the screen is not very bright, and the touchpad's button feels a little clunky. In summary, if you can't afford more than $300, this is a good choice for casual users who only have a few tabs open at once and use it mostly for email, Facebook, web surfing, and streaming music or videos. If you can afford $350 to $400, you will have several choices with more powerful CPUs for more intensive users."}, {"name": "jrodshibuya", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "October 28, 2018", "title": "Excellent Chromebook for the money", "review_text": "I am extremely impressed with this unit.

Of course the display could be better but for what you use it for 95% of the time, 1366 x 768 is more than adequate. Videos are sharp and clear, document display clearly and crisp and texts are sharp on the screen. You can operate this in all different ways; as a laptop, flat tablet or tent mode to watch your favorite movies. Touch screen is very responsive, I kept forgetting it's a laptop! One gripe however, the SD card slot is shallow; put a SD card in the it sticks out more than half the length. So you wouldn't want to leave the card in; must remove it after use. Of course, you know the benefits of a Chrome book. Light weight (in many ways, both software and hardware), no need for tedious OS upgrade, no worries about viruses while providing everything a computer user needs. If you are a Netflix subscriber, there is no download option however so you couldn't take a movie to watch on the plane ride. Regardless of these limitations, I still love this chrome book and it would definitely with me on trip from now on."}, {"name": "Two kids mom", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "December 2, 2018", "title": "Good value at the price for everyday use as long as you are not a demanding gamer.", "review_text": "I am a big fan of Chromebooks. They update themselves, can now run at least some Google apps.  They are portable, cheap enough to haul where ever you go and fit one both airplane trays and the teeny desks they give students at college.  This one is a good value at the price for everyday use as long as you are not a demanding gamer. Pros: Price. Touchscreen.  Nice at this price point! Lots of connections SB-C 3.0 port USB-A 3.0 port, a full-size HDMI connection and a DisplayPort port a full-size SD card reader, combo audio jack.  There is NO Thunderbold 3port. Keyboard is excellent for the size.  Nice rebound to the keys. Folds so watching videos is easier.  And when you fold it the speakers are then behind the screen, which gives reasonable sound for this small of a device. Battery lasted 10 (surfing internet mainly) hours, 11 hours (mostly playing videos) and 10.5 (combo of tasks) hours in three trials.  This is a long time.  You can get through an entire day with this.  Screen was at between 50 and 70 percent brightness for these tests, higher brightness will drain it faster. Will run Google apps that are available (not all google apps are available for chromebooks) Lots of storage at 64GB for a Chromebook. You can add more with the SD slot. Has Bluetooth, so you can use your headphone to get a better audio experience. Cons: The bezel is too large for the size (see photo).  The resolution is not great at 1,366 x 768 (140 PPI).  We have all become a little spoiled with the clarity of phones, this is noticeably lower.  It has a refresh rate of 60Hz so it is fine for catching a little Netflix, but do not expect high def quality. No backlighting on the keyboard. No number pad. Its too slow for intense gaming.  You will not be playing any high demand games on this, it lags.

I had to return the first one I bought, because there was a problem with the sleep and the bluetooth. Sleep, because when I would close the lid, it would just power off the device, rather than putting it in suspension. Bluetooth, because when connected to a bluetooth mouse for anywhere between 5 to 30 minutes, it will bug out and refuse to work again until it's rebooted. Now, I had thought that the problems might be related, and since it was a hardware issue, the replacement would be free of both problems. However, I was wrong, unfortunately. It seems the bluetooth issue is just what the device does. It's a bit disappointing, as my Moto X Pure Edition (which was the first Moto X made by Motorola after being purchased by Lenovo) had nearly this very same issue with its bluetooth. It makes me draw the conclusion that Lenovo makes poor decisions when they choose who they use for bluetooth radios. That aside, everything else about this Chromebook is fairly surprising. It's snappy, sounds good, looks good, works well. It's a lot better than it has any right to be at the price point they have it at. I am, again, disappointed that their cost saving measures had them put in a faulty bluetooth radio in them, but I will find a way. I work from this thing, so I can't be without it again, and I am not rollin' in the dough, so beggars and choosers and all that. If bluetooth isn't a huge need, this is the ticket. If bluetooth is a big deal, you might want to invest in a more expensive chromebook from someone like ASUS, who uses great hardware."}, {"name": "Christini7", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "April 10, 2019", "title": "Great while it worked...for all of 42 days", "review_text": "If I'd written this review right after I received my Chromebook I would have said it's a great little computer for the money.  Unfortunately, it suddenly stopped working after 42 days. Amazon tech support and Lenovo tech support walked me through a few fixes to try, but ultimately the screen just wouldn't turn on. Of course, the standard Amazon return period for this machine is 30 days, and Lenovo does not offer any warranty for machines sold by re-sellers (including Amazon). I found this out after Amazon transferred me over to Lenovo. Lenovo transferred me again, disconnected me and ultimately made me try the same fixes again before sharing the details of this delightful policy. Ultimately my Amazon Tech requested an exception, and I was allowed to return the machine.  That said, I'm not going to buy another one and risk having another lemon of a machine that essentially doesn't have a warranty. I'm going back to buying Macs + Applecare.

I LOVE this Chromebook and feel fortunate to have above a basic understanidng of how Chromebooks work.  First, it came with a Lenovo box packaged in an amazon box. No problems opening the packages or initiating start up with the Chromebook.  The winter white case is plastic and may require extra care.  However, it does NOT look or feel cheap as noted by other customers.  Also, because I noted the complaints with regard to speed associated with memory, I did purchase the larger 4 gb RAM and 64 gb memory with a SSD.  I really think this is a gamechanger and will be utilizing this Chromebook for online classes and anything else I may need to do online.  I have already been able to utilize commonly accessed apps for my cell phone on my Chromebook!  No problems with anything thus far.  I will update. Today is 4/16/19 and I am still enjoying my Chromebook.  A couple things that have come up with regard to the laptop keyboard: the keys can pop off if snagged.  The keys have popped or snapped on easily when I noticed they were gone. It is nice that the keys don't actually break off.  I have noticed that some apps still don't work on Chromebooks, however there are extensions to improve access."}, {"name": "Andrew Dresden", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "January 21, 2019", "title": "Best dollar to feature ratio of any Chromebook", "review_text": "I only had a few days to use this before I discovered a flaw I thought was just a feature of the device, was actually a hardware defect. When you close the lid, it is supposed to sleep. Suspend. Instead, mine would shut down completely, logging me out and erasing any of my unsaved work in my apps. I use this for work, I can have that. However, I learned, having done a bunch of reading to figure this out, that this item page isn't the default item listing for the Lenovo C330 (this), so when I had to return the defective unit, I reordered my replacement through the Amazon listing itself. Theirs is 64gb, and the same price as this. That aside, I am blown away at how amazing this Chromebook is. It is so much better than it has any right to be at this price point. It's closest competition is a $474 ASUS. 2-n-1 Touchscreen at $240 is remarkably cheaper than the other options, so I very much assumed I would get what I paid for. But I got a much more valuable device for a heck of a lot less than I should have. It's quick, the speakers, while are not optimally placed for laptop mode, are the loudest (and still clear) speakers on any portable computer I've ever used (including laptops, tablets, and smartphones). It boots fast, it is kept up to date with the newest Chrome OS features, including being one of the few to get the formerly Pixel book exclusives like Google Play and Instant Tether. Linux apps are inbound as well. If you are needing a device that's fast, versatile, and affordable, go no further. But search around Amazon for the best possible deal.

It was purchased for a student who has a chromebook at school so she was using it immediately and very thrilled to have it. The Amazon description doesn't have a model number but the paperwork says it is a C330. I'm thinking it's a newer version of the model since the description says it came out in November 2018 and there aren't any reviews yet. The C330 model 81HY0000US is listed as being released on Aug 2018 and I read those reviews before purchasing. I took a chance getting something without a review because it had a similar description to the C330 and it was able to arrive within 2 days. The white color is very nice, the weight is nice and it seems sturdy. There were remarks on the C330 reviews about settling for a resolution that wasn't as good as others, but I think the graphics are just fine. The keyboard has a nice touch and it has many features I was looking for - a touch screen; blue tooth; and being able to fold it to use as a tablet. Bonus: it sits in other positions for easy movie viewing; HDMI; USB slots, SD slot; camera, etc... I know you can get a more basic Chromebook for $150 - $200 but it was work paying $250 to get all of these extra features. I just can't see getting one without a touch screen.

I needed to replace my 9 year old Macbook Pro that was an excellent machine but just couldn't handle modern computing needs. However, I have a desktop for more intense computing needs, so I really didn't want to spend $1000+ on a new MacBook to browse the web, watch YouTube videos, read eBooks, watch Netflix etc in the evening. Cheap laptops in the sub $350 range are frankly almost all junk, so I wasn't really interested in buying one of those either. I don't want a tablet because I want a keyboard and I like to lie flat in bed and that's just not convenient. Enter the Chromebook! So far, this has been an impressive solution for the purchase price of $231. Of course, Chromebooks have a variety of hardware and you need to do your homework to get the best experience. For about $50 more than lesser Chrombooks, this is an ideal middle ground solution. Within its comparable price range, the MediaTek MT8173C processor scores at the top as far as processing speed. Coupled with 4GB DDR3 RAM and a 64 GB SSD for boot speed, plus how lightweight of an OS ChromeOS is, this is a very well performing little machine for the price. Web browsing is snappy, YouTube loads very quickly and the Google Play store gives you access to all the apps you need. So far, all apps have loaded without any issues and function well. The battery life is remarkable - I've gotten 13-14 hours of use from it and still had 15% when I finally plugged it in. ChromeOS is super easy to learn/user friendly and reminds me of the user experience of a phone/tablet. NOW - this machine is not a few things. It doesn't have a super high resolution screen, but it's a small screen, so it's not bad, but if you're used to a Retina screen it will be a bit lower in quality. It is fine and perfectly functional, but not exceptional, as a tablet (not the best touch screen response and obviously heavier than normal tablets and ChromeOS isn't as optimized for touch screen use compared to phone/tablet operating systems - think things like bigger front/back/X buttons - those aren't as prevalent on ChromeOS). The keypad is nice and sensitive but the click is loud. Printing is probably a pain but I have a desktop for that, so I don't care. So far, those are really the only cons I have found to this machine, but the pros far outweigh and you need to be realistic about features vs. price. It does a lot of things really well at the current list price of $251. It is not a $1000 laptop and you simply can't expect $1000 features from it. I'm very glad I spent the extra money for this over the sub-$200 Chromebooks with lower quality hardware and no convertible/touch screens. The convertible/touch really makes it fun to use. So, in summary: If you just need a machine to do run of the mill browsing, streaming, etc I think this is an almost perfect solution and an excellent value for the money."}, {"name": "Zhuansun Ren", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "November 28, 2018", "title": "Great low-end chromebook for web surf", "review_text": "I got my device for $200 (normal $300) on Black Friday.

Very Impressed.", "review_text": "Regarding Chrome OS.  This is my first chromebook so I'm still learning, but so far I'm extremely impressed!  It seems like the chromebook was the computer I've always needed but never realized I wanted!  Marrying the pc experience to an android compatible operating system is magical.  Although I'm apprehensive about this browser-based computing, I've found it very easy to save and edit documents offline so I'm still able to work on the go.  I can also connect it to my android phone, send and receive text messages with it, emulate old school video games, connect it to my bluetooth speakers and blast some jams.  I regret not making Chrome OS a part of my life MUCH sooner! Regarding performance.  I've heard people say this processor is mediocre.  I have to ask, what are those people even doing to arrive at the conclusion?!  I have not once seen the slightest indication that this thing isn't *completely* competent for daily needs.  Incredible response time.  No lag when scrolling.  Minimal to no delay opening apps.  Stunningly fast start up time.  I feel like it's a pretty outstanding performer, overall.  Really, what more could you ask for? Regarding the build quality.  It's a bit bulky in its \"tablet\" mode and lacks the premium build materials of high end chromebooks, but it still looks and feels great, certainly better than any laptop PC I've ever owned!  The white color is gorgeous.  The size is perfect.  The keyboard is comfortable and the touch pad is large and responsive.  If you look closely you'll see Lenovo coated the touch pad with a hefty clear coat to prevent wear and tear.  As someone who immediately coats touch pads with contact paper to prevent damage, this is an impressive step, however inconspicuous to the average user.  Additionally the hinge feels solid and smooth.  The construction of the entire build just feels extremely sturdy.  The monitor produces extremely sharp images with outstanding color.  Although many people express dissatisfaction with the lack of 1080p and the larger bezels framing the monitor, I didn't even notice!  (Side note: If bezels really concern you, consider the experience of flipping this into tablet mode and walking around with it while working.

To me, a Chromebook was nothing more than an ADM-3A incarnate; connected to the cloud, instead of a mainframe.  But as Chromebooks started adding Chrome OS, Android and now Linux; I decided that I should get one, to carry around with me on trips; that did not require me to have access to a Windows Pro system. The hardest decision I had to make about this particular purchase, was if I should get the 64gb \"Amazon's Choice\" unit that was actually being sold by Lenovo; or a more expensive 32gb unit sold by other sellers, because their product titles included the words \"Newest 2019.\"  Rest assured, when my 64gb unit arrived, the \"Manufactured\" date on the box was only 2 weeks old. While you are waiting for your order to arrive; it helps to pre-create a Google account, just for the Chromebook.  You can setup & customize a Chrome profile exclusively for use by the Chromebook; and then \"Add\" your other Google accounts to that Chrome profile.  This will speed things up when your Chromebook arrives, because you can just log into that Google account & Chrome profile; and your Chromebook is ready to go.  The advantage of this, besides setup speed, is that you won't clutter your Chromebook's login screen with more than one account choice. Be sure to update your version of Chrome OS.  As of the late March 2019 manufacturing run, version 70 comes installed.  You need at least version 72, if you expect to run Linux, from the get-go. For right now, the only thing that really surprised me about the unit, which may or may not be a \"standard Chromebook thing,\" is that I have (until now) never seen a physical keyboard that was labeled with lower case letters on it!  Speaking of the keyboard, for those who are wondering, the keyboard is disabled after the hinge goes beyond 180 degrees.  It does feel \"weird\" however, to feel the keyboard pressing against your fingers or lap, when using the Chromebook in tablet mode. ********** 2019-04-27 Update ********** Because the display side of the clamshell is so lightweight; when used in \"laptop mode,\" it is very sensitive to motion transfer, and may show signs of noticeable vibration."}, {"name": "Kindle Customer", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "March 19, 2019", "title": "bad usb port", "review_text": "big problem with getting this machine fixed.

Now, these Chromebooks AREN'T made for this kind of work, so I wouldn't grade it on that.  Basically, I just needed this machine to work as a gateway to my remote machines, and for that, this worked perfectly.  It's light, quick, and simply get's the job done.  If you can keep your work limited to stuff you can do in Chrome (and *some* Android native apps), then this particular machine should be able to get the job done. With that being said, my machine had issues with Bluetooth that I simply couldn't ignore.  Normally, I don't utilize bluetooth very often, but due to the nature of this device and the way I wanted to use it (i.e., highly portable with the 2-in-1 feature), I planned the purchase around it.  The Bluetooth was essentially non-functional.  After looking into it, I found that basically every Chromebook has issues with bluetooth (so it's not necessarily specific to this device), but despite trying everything I could to get the bluetooth even mildly functional (trying beta builds, updating drivers, experimental Bluteooth software, etc.), nothing worked.  Specifically, I could connect to the machine's bluetooth, but after a few minutes, the blueooth would completely cease to work and would only work again after a reboot. After realizing that I wasn't going to be able to fix this problem, I returned the device.  I then bought another 2-in-1 Chromebook that was a little more pricey (I'll try to avoid outright advertising for them, but it was $500 Samsung device, so it cost twice as much).  This device is leagues better. First, the bluetooth actually works.  I still see many of the \"quarks\" that every Chromebook has, but I an actually use the Bluetooth with little issue.  But, that's not the only improvement.  The machine itself is significantly faster, which may not be of much value for most, but certainly improves my experience.  The touchscreen is also drastically superior, allowing for active pen use.  Again, if the \"touchscreen\" portion of these devices aren't that big a deal, then this might not matter, but after using the active pen, I could never go back to a simple touchscreen.  On top of this stuff, the new machine is much lighter and much more comfortable.  I've had people comparing it to an iPad when in tablet mode, which was certainly not the case for the C330. All in all, the C330 is a fine device, but it attempt to be too much of too many things, and doesn't do any of it right.  It's cheap, which is a big plus, but not cheap enough.  It's a 2-in-1, but isn't very good as a tablet.  And it's a Chromebook, but slow and not completely functioning.  I'd suggest either going cheaper and finding a Chromebook that isn't a 2-in-1, or spending the extra money to find a proper 2-in-1.

After the usual initial setup (which is very easy due to the simplicity of Google), the battery life is definitely longer compared to my old Chromebook. I didn't really clock it but even with multiple tabs running at full brightness and full audio, id say it was about 5 hours before I had to plug in, which sets you up for a good idea on how long it performs when you're frugal with your power usage. Audio was very clear, screen had good resolution and responsive touch feedback (but a fingerprint and smudge magnet!) and does well in the multiple tablet modes while still staying snug. Build-wise is where the issues arise. While light, it is very obvious after long use, plasticky. The keyboard tends to be rather noisy and clicky at at times non-responsive and annoying. There's been times that button presses don't respond at all which FORCED me to switch to the tablet modes and rely on the touch-screen.

The quality is far greater than the HP piles of junk out there. The screen is magnificent for such a cheap little thing.

I have used a lot of machines - including Macs and Dell. I don't feel the price for those things are justified in anyway unless you are a full time graphics dev or designer and need heavy overpriced programs like Photoshop. There are superb alternatives with open source. Inkscape, GIMP, Scribus...and more. Cheap Chromebooks can't do everything but they are getting better all the time. I highly suggest updating Chrome when you buy this laptop, restart it then open settings and turn on Linux Beta. Learn about the programs you can run and how intelligent Linux is at installing them.

With 4GB of Ram and 64GB of drive space this has much more than most other Chromebooks in the same price point. Although not full HD (my only complaint) the screen is colorful and vibrant, and the touch screen responsive. Converting from computer to tablet works seamlessly. Whats nice is with the Mediatek processor you can load most (not all) Android apps. Also, at my time of purchase, Google is giving you many offers for FREE like 100gb of Google drive space, among other things. You also have HDMI, SD card, headphone, and USB ports. The power adapter is USB-C as well. All in all this Chromebook is a great buy at this price. I was very happy with the speed and flawless operation.

The many ways to fold it are great as well.  It makes it easy to prop up and watch videos. The touch screen is not a \"tablet\" so you can't use it for art - just so it's clear.

This chromebook is fairly light and small and gets the job done and there little to no wait time when you open the chromebook turning on automatically. There a bunch of things i noticed while using it is you can link your phone with the chromebook in where once you previously log into the chromebook beforehand you can unlock your chromebook right after by unlocking your phone (both have to have bluetooth enable). To search up shortcuts you can easily click the search button on the keyboard and type in shortcut and it have it where you can search all the shortcuts you can do and what nice is any additional keyboard say a bluetooth one can also do some of the shortcuts. Also there are options where you can close the laptop and you have two options you can either put the laptop to sleep or it just turns off the screen then there a option to lock it by closing it or not. nice note is if you have display off you can still listen to pandora,mp3,or youtube. Also for those who are wondering - you can play minecraft, ragnorak mobile (not fully keyboard control it only for texting in chat so no WASD movement) and hearthstone on it so it have it nice touch but you cant use the split screen feature from chrome so that a bummer now for the drawbacks. Also you can use microsoft word, excel and powerpoint from the googleplay store but you would need a account for it or just use the free online version. This is small nit pick - the screen is 720p yet it clear but it is noticeable when you use it long enough wish it was HD or 1080p also some apps are set to the 720p by default. the google play store youtube uses the quality of the screen while chrome youtube (basically youtube normally on browser) is more clear. Also skype doesn't have screenshare or sharesound so that a major bummer and skype seem to run slow on the chromebook in terms having people sharescreen their desktop it always come out blurry on some occasions and i have to minimize and reopen skype to actually see what going on. i haven't try video call yet so it up to debate. Lastly for discord from google playstore you would need to adjust some of the call setting for it to work. the default setting would cut you off mid sentence and random pausing in between. Another thing is you can't adjust the idle timer it either it goes to sleep, display turns off or stays on there no option to change it and when you have option to lock your desktop it end your skype call so you would have to go into settings for normal use, call use, and game use. lastly is your better off having your laptop go into sleep mode with locked instead of turning it off. when you shut it down the screen goes blank white then gets brighter and brighter then goes to black. it's just me being paranoid like it would be better if it just dims and turns off instead of going very bright then poof black not to mention if you usually play on medium to low brightness setting then having your screen go maximum brightness with no setting to change it get annoying not to mention when you open up your chromebook after shutting it off it adjusted your brightness setting as well as well a bright chrome logo before going into login. Mostly this is a nit pick since it bothersome when you are using it in middle of the night then when you turn it off it hit you with the brightest setting so i just end up closing it to sleep mode or shut off and look away.

Pros: The battery can last a whole day of good usage, the screen quality is great, the keyboard feels nice, and my favorite thing: it's FAST! I was so sick of my slow as a** clunky hp laptop. It takes probably like 10 seconds to start up, and pages are quick to load. The laptop is a perfect size for sitting on your lap or putting in your bag, and it's really light to carry around. Not necessarily \"cons\", just stuff that takes a little to get used to: Like with any chromebook, most of the \"apps\" are just in another window of the browser. That being said, I managed to find a good add on to chrome for spotify and discord, but if you use other apps that you're used to on pc or mac, you might find that a problem. With microsoft apps, you could just use the online versions and they work fine for my student purposes. The touchpad feels a little inaccurate, but after some use, I got used to it. The two-finger scrolling and zooming feels nice, though. Also, the speakers are kinda washed out but again, I got used to it. Actual cons: It's crashed on me a handful of times already... normally, it's just a little annoying since it starts back up so quickly, but recently I had it crashed TWICE during an online midterm. Really though, that was just awful timing and otherwise I don't really mind it. Any issues I had at first were gone after time passed.

So I returned it and got another. That one and another (total of 3) suffered the same failure. Apparently lenovo does not offer help desk support for chromebooks.  My kids c330 works fine. I was ready to get a 4th but they were back ordered and the price had gone up so I selected a different mfg.

I am a longtime computer user starting with a \"Sinclair\" that used a cassette  recorder for a hard drive . Then the Commodore  64 came out  and I had one of them. Eventually got a Desktop with Windows 3.1  then Windows got fancier every time , the last one I really liked was XP. I also had a IBM mainframe that came complete with all the huge disk drives  and a 6 ' wide printer and all the operating manuals and took a 16 ' box truck to move. Then Microsoft changed to Windows 7 , liked it OK but it got worse and worse with updates and then the notice about  quitting support and get Windows 10 or else! Well for me its else! I have tried Win 10  and absolutely hated it. Good bye Microsoft! I read all the reviews on every brand of Chromebook that I could afford being a disabled Vet. I decided on this Lenovo C-330. Ordered it on 7/16/2019 and got it the next day. Had no trouble whatsoever with setup , I followed the setup guide  and figured it would take hours to charge the battery and then do the setup. I let it charge for about 30 minutes and then decided  to take a look. I  was surprised that ir was fully charged and in seconds it had booted up, updated its self and all my stuff was available from my old computer. The only thing that didn't meet the description was that the spec's said it had a Micro SD card slot and this one has a full size slot. Sure it has a small keyboard but I can only use 2 fingers anyway and  use a mouse to browse with and the touch screen to read books so its no hardship to me.  All in all  if you are a fence sitter like me don't wait any longer and buy your self a Chromebook !

Fortunately, I was able to get this next-day Prime delivered to where I was staying in LA and began using it minutes after it arrived. To make this review easy, I'm breaking it down by main key features: display, keyboard, battery life, and build quality. Display: For the price, I don't think you're going to find one much nicer in terms of resolution and quality. Incredibly, you are getting a true IPS panel with nice viewing angles. I've found that the low res matte displays on other cheaper Chromebooks are incredibly difficult use and lead to eye strain. I'm a personal believer in purchasing as much screen real estate and pixel density as possible -- it really does make a huge difference. Another huge plus (and I'm not sure if this across the Chromebook line or specific to this one) is the night mode that cuts out blue light and boosts yellows -- this is another hugely important feature for me, personally. Touch screen functionality works fine. Display cons are that the bezels are massive and with it being super glossy, there can be lots of glare. Keyboard: Basically Lenovo has it figured out with keyboard layouts and feel. While it's nowhere near as nice as the Thinkpad keyboard, this one is laid out quite nicely and is easy to complete bigger writing assignments on. There's no backlight, which would be a huge plus, but for the price, it's difficult to find anything to complain about. The top row function keys will be familiar to those coming from the Mac ecosystem. Everything is very easy. The trackpad is also surprisingly nice for the price as well. Gestures work without issue. Battery life: This is where this computer truly shines. I purchased this while I was traveling during the winter and needed to it to complete weekly freelance assignments and had plenty of battery life while on the road. Even when being back home laying in bed watching Youtube or Netflix, the battery lasts all night, and then some. I basically never take the charger with me because I don't feel that it's necessary (unless it's already low on juice). In terms of just general surfing and Google doc stuff, you should be able to get a couple of days out of the battery. If you're watching videos and streaming, it's still a good full day's worth of battery life. Build quality: I've previously had an HP Chromebook and was not impressed by the build quality by any means. It felt cheap, almost like a toy. While this Lenovo Chromebook feels much more solid, I still wouldn't compare it to a Thinkpad or the higher end machines in Lenovo's lineup. Still, it feels quite durable and I've never worried about carrying it in a pack all day, or stacking books and other heavy items on top of it. The only thing that is kind of a bother is that the brilliant white finish does get smudges and dirty fingerprints on it. But that's more of a nuisance, not a flaw with the machine. For the price, you really can't do much better. So long as you have reasonable expectations for what you're getting and how much you're paying, you will be very pleased by this product."}, {"name": "Tbaby", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "April 28, 2019", "title": "Using the up down arrow keys to scroll..", "review_text": "I like the fact that it's like one big phone.

The screen quality is great enough to read books clearly for a long period of time. Ultimately, this is a great Chromebook depending on what you want to do, such as browsing, school, apps, book and audiobook storage. Cons: The speakers are on the bottom of the Chromebook, where sound can be muffled. This can easily be fixed with headphones and the Chromebook supports Bluetooth. The SD card slot is not big enough, the card hangs out. The Chromebook does not have a grippy feel to it, very slippery. The keyboard may feel cramped to some. Also, the body of this Chromebook is not very durable. I dropped this thing and the body easily dents. I mean, it's a pretty body but not practical for my use for the long term. Also, I rarely use tablet or portrait positions on this tablet because it's so awkward. It's made to be used vertically and it's a bit bulky. But it's great for apps and video.

So, my wife thought I'd be a good idea to order this Chromebook for me as it is a 2-in-1 model. And, I'm super thankful that she did. I am really impressed with this device. Although it is a bit heavier than I would want, it does everything that I need it to do and more. Initially, I was a bit bothered by the large bezels on the screen. I figured the company could have definitely made them quite smaller. However, as you can see from the picture above, the bezels are actually the right size for one-handed holding when in tablet mode. The bezels actually prevent accidental touches to the screen, so that is much more useful than I originally thought. For the price, this is a fantastic Chromebook. Battery life is good, the screen is quite responsive, and the programs show up really well on the screen. Also, this Chromebook (as well as many of the newer versions) come installed with the Google play store.

I decided to get one because most of what I use a computer for doesn't require anything more heavy duty than what this has to offer. I'll still use my other computer should I require things like Photoshop or those heavier use programs, but since I got my Chromebook a week ago, I haven't even touched my other laptop. The Pros: Battery life - When it estimates that I have 12-13 hours of battery life, it means it. I can stream videos and multitask and it doesn't sacrifice that time. Time to charge is also impressively quick. Speed - I open the lid and it's on. It's that simple. No waiting for everything to load up. I had to do an update and it took maybe 10 seconds, including restart time. I know internet will vary depending on network, but I'm able to easily multitask and it's not dragging. I'm currently casting a video to my TV and have multiple tabs open on chrome, all with no lag to the video (which would often happen with my other laptop). Ease of use - If you're already a chrome/google user, switching over to a chromebook is a piece of cake. I didn't have to transfer anything, and I do have to eventually back a few more things up to my Drive, but again, that's easy. Getting used to more app-based programs than desktop ones is easy enough too.  Almost everything that would have required a windows download has an app version or a way to use it on a chromebook as well. Screen/Tablet mode - I haven't toyed too much with the touch screen, but it's a nice perk. I like being able to flip the screen around and turn it to the side and bam, it's a big tablet. So far I've only used it like this once to read some comics, but it was nice. Brightness is great too. I usually have it down halfway or less even. Size - I was worried about it being too small because my other laptop is somewhere between 13-14'' but it's a really great size. This thing is incredibly light too. Much lighter than I'd expected. Love it. The Cons, though extremely minor: Caps Lock - Mostly, it's a \"getting used to\" factor that I just haven't quite mastered yet. There's no caps lock key, and the search button that replaces it isn't terrible, but I think I'd have preferred to just have the caps key. (You can just press alt+search for caps lock easily enough though) Backlighting - my other computer had backlit keys. Totally an \"extra\" that's not necessary, but regardless. And that's it.

There are several android apps that do not work well but the android apps she needs these days do work OK and that is all that is important for now. She did not like using the GMAIL app, so we turned on the linux option and installed the linux version Thunderbird mail .  Thunderbird mail  takes a little longer to start up than the other apps but seems to work very well. This is an ARM device so many of the applications that work on the Raspberry Pi etc will work on this device. Once installed the program icons can be placed on the shelf to be started as any other app.. There is/was a learning curve as the Chomebook does not have all the settings where  android devices normally keep the same settings. It appeared you must keep it in developer mode to run apps from unknown sources making it less desirable for us to access the Amazon App store. Switching to and from developer mode requires a complete reset, but as soon as you log in to Google your settings and apps are restored. It takes a few minutes, so it is not something you want to do often. In tent mode the Lenovo Chomebook is nicer than using the Samsung 8.1 tablet on a stand.  We used a wireless mouse at first but found it easier to just use the touch screen.  However the touch screen does not work as good as the regular android devices we  own.  We did play with the \"text\" mode where you write on the screen and it adds it to your document, fun but not for us. Overall, we are happy with the purchase, we did not want to spend a lot of money for a high priced quality Chromebook until we knew we would actually like using it.  As others have noted, this Chrome box is pretty nice, for the most part easy to use and probably more secure than most regular laptops.

Their MediaTek MT8173C outperforms the other available processors in benchmark tests. 5. Get 64GB, not 32 or 16. Space fills up fast, especially if you aren't good deleting emails, etc. 6. Add a low-profile thumb drive. With another 64, 128, or even 256 GB, storing pix is a breeze. 7. 2:1 is nice, but I don't use it much. Nice to have feature for me. 8. The battery is great.

From looking at the tablets of folks I know it's obvious fingerprints and smudges don't bother a lot of people. I'm adjusting.

The r13 has bigger display and uses micro sd  card that doesn't stick out like on the c330. Also the r13 you only get 32 GB as apposed to 64 GB with C330. I give the C330 3.5 stars.

Likes: light, battery life, value, general usability - no major compromises as far as I can tell switching from Windows 10. The convertible functions great. I switched to tablet mode and rotated to portrait mode while reading a PDF doc the other day in the office and felt like a boss :) Not so much: Keyboard feels and sounds cheap. Same for the mousepad - functions fine but is loud on click. For me working in tech and surrounded by people on macbooks, this chromebook looks nice, but lacks that last mile of refinement. Another low is it only has a single USB slot (should have read the specs more closely) which for me means when I work at home I'll need to invest in some sort of docking solution to connect external mouse and keyboard. The screen is OK - so far no major issues with resolution (1 exception ironically enough is the Google account icons on the top right - the circular profile pic is pixelated on the edges). There is a wide border between the edge of the computer and the edge of the screen - about 1 inch on top, left and right and  1.5 to 2 inches on the bottom. Overall I'm still giving it 4 out of 5 because for a home computer, this thing is awesome.

I can easily get 10 hours out of it. Using it off and on, for an hour or two at a time, I can get a week or more out of the battery without having to ever charge it. I just it for an hour or two and shut it down, it last's at least a week.

The screen: Considering this Chromebook is very cheap. It's a nice screen, it has good quality, not so great color accuracy, but it's still great. It's touchscreen and it responds great. No problems at all. 2. Keyboard: This keyboard let's me type fast. Really fast. It has good travel, it feels quick. It's very nice! 3. Audio: Here is where I spected a downside but no, it sounds good. Not very loud to be honest but good quality. The speakers are down facing like most of the regular laptops nowadays but it sounds very good, even if you put it on the bed. 4. Battery Life. You can easily get 14-15 hours of light use(Surfing on the web, reading). 10-12 Hours of moderate use (working on documents, watching YouTube videos, Netflix) 8 hours of heavy use (Gaming) 5.  Look & Feel Looks nice! No problem, it looks like a Lenovo laptop, very formal, very professional, it does have that Chromebook logo that screws up a little bit the professional look but that's fine. It feels strong, it wont fall apart very easily, it won't scratch easily too because it's like hard plastic but very well made. To finish I would like to say that if you're on a budget and need a laptop that can get the job done, this is for you. Remember this is a Chromebook and ChromeOS is more like it was an Android tablet with steroids . You can't freely install any software here, like Microsoft Office, Photoshop, etc, you're basically stuck with the web versions of those, but again this is to keep it simple."}, {"name": "Buddy Fritz", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "April 5, 2019", "title": "Works perfectly for me", "review_text": "I have several window computers, two tablets, a kindle and 2 phones.

I use google photos on my phone, so it was great to have the photos back up into the laptop with just a push of a button.  There was also a promo that came with extra space on the google drive for 2 years when I bought this chromebook.  The touchscreen works pretty well, although not as smooth as iPad/iphone level, but i was able to use Adobe Sketch and Whiteboard apps when I needed to \"draw\" for my class or studying. Battery life is pretty good.  I ran YouTube videos (some on 1080p), charged my phone, and read on kindle at the same time (sometimes switching between different reading such as adobe pdf viewer apps) and the battery lasted a good solid 8 hours, so if you need a light laptop with a long battery life, this is a good option. Some cons: The memory SD slot -  I didn't like how when you place the memory card in the slot, it sticks out, but I hardly use it anyways so it doesn't bother me too much. Another thing, some apps aren't compatible as they are on a windows/apple.  Even if the apps are available on Google Play, some of them either didn't load at all or they would not work as smoothly as it would on a windows / apple.  The good thing though is there's a lot of alternate programs, but if you are someone that needs a laptop for strictly a particular program/app that may only work on windows/apple, this might not be for you. Overall, for the price and quality, I think this is a great laptop.  I use it for internet browsing and for my school work to read pdfs and for studying and I'm satisfied with the product."}]},

Taylor", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "August 15, 2019", "title": "The Better Option (8GB vs 12GB)", "review_text": "A very nice laptop and it feels premium. The material is mostly plastic but I appreciate that for the reduced weight. This is my first Ryzen machine, and I am mainly using it to run a Citrix environment (cloud-based VM). Today will be the first full 8+-hour day using it. The power brick is not excessively huge. About the width and height of a standard post-it note, and 1\" thick. The cable is over 5' (my measuring tape only goes to 60\") closer to 6'. It has a barrel connector so unfortunately, it is not easily replaceable with a USB C cable (next model, pretty please?) The keyboard is backlit, which is nice for the darker surrounding often found in my home office. Typing is okay, but there is a noticeably shorter key travel than other laptops/Chromebooks I have used. I'm getting used to it, but like with any new keyboard, there will be a small learning curve. I keep missing the home row and using the Caps Lock as the A key for some reason. I'm using it on a small folding table at the moment so that could be the reason. The screen is nice, it is a 16:9 full HD screen, and for me, I prefer 16:9 to the new standard of 2:3 (more of a square). It is not bright though. Not at all. Even with the curtains open, there are times when I am still trying to get more brightness out of this display. It's not unusable, but forget trying to use it outdoors. Touch is fine and works. I did not buy this to use as a tablet though but Windows 10 has some processing going on in the background that makes it easy to hit small buttons in applications without being terribly accurate. The pen is interesting to me as it is roughly the size of a real pen [*cough* Samsung*cough*] which makes it easier to draw/write with without immediately cramping my hand. The Dolby Audio on the speakers leaves a lot to be desired. Some tweaking was needed to get the overblown sounds to subside. During the initial setup, it was hard to listen to. Turning Dolby Audio off though somehow reduces the speaker volume by 2/3... Not the actual volume percentage, but the actual sound. Dolby is using some sort of gain control so 20% volume sounds more like 40%. 4k video on YouTube looks great and only dropped 3 frames in a 2:44 video (Borderlands 3 FLAK FTW!) but that could have been from me trying to make it full-screen.  I have not tried any games yet, but I did install Diablo 3, and World of Warcraft Classic. If anyone is interested, I will update this when I try them. With the Vega graphics, there is an automatic 2GB reduction in RAM availability. Couple this with the 8GB model and you are left with 6GB to run Windows 10 and any applications. Budget for the 12 GB model unless you are A) skilled with laptop hardware, and B) don\u2019t care about the warranty. I\u2019ve seen the tear-downs, and there is an open RAM slot. I usually don\u2019t tear open electronics until a year after I own it (unless there is a reason to do so). The WiFi issue that is detailed on the 8GB model is non-existent for me. I feel like I may be more qualified to test that as Citrix requires a constant network connection and gives an immediate alert if connectivity drops for more than a couple seconds. No issues here, running the latest Windows updates. Overall I\u2019m happy with this laptop, It is much lighter than my 15\u201d Acer Predator and looks a lot more professional when traveling for work."}, {"name": "An Honest Reviewer", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "September 24, 2019", "title": "Steal of a Deal!", "review_text": "Disclaimer: I am a serious computer geek and a bit of a snob when it comes to tech.

Its not a super long lasting battery but I seem to get 5 hours out of it at a time (in balanced mode and dimming the brightness a bit - honestly, you get what you pay for. My take: I bought this laptop for graduate school. I wanted something I could use to take written notes as well as use to do all my assignments. It needed to be portable, fairly lightweight, all while not compromising on performance. This laptop fit my needs on paper. Now, after using it (practically daily) for a month, I can say its a pleasure to use. It boots up in seconds (like less than 20), and has a lightning fast fingerprint sensor. My other laptop is a Thinkpad X1 Extreme, which I intended to be a powerhouse (32 GB RAM, i7-8850H, 4K, GTX-1080Ti Max-Q). Honestly, this laptop puts my \"powerhouse\" to shame in many ways. The Flex 14 boots up QUICKER, has less graphical errors when switching between desktops, and has a brighter back-light on its keyboard. Of course the Flex 14 can't run a virtual lab environment comprising of 4 machines like my Thinkpad Extreme, but it sure can run 2 VMs simultaneously (at least on the 12 GB RAM config). This laptop is SO good for the price I'm honestly shocked that it is not listed in the best laptops of 2019 list on YouTube or Google - its really a great find. Thank you Amazon! TLDR: This laptop is amazing. If you're a student, someone who seeks a 2 in 1 experience, a person who doesn't want to pay $800+ for a laptop and needs something portable yet powerful enough to get actual work done, this is the laptop for you."}, {"name": "Glenn E Oller", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "August 15, 2019", "title": "Awesome computer for the balance of price and options", "review_text": "I bought this to replace an Acer that was stolen, and the price of the Acer went up as I only bought it a few months ago.

Nearly any laptop can do that, but this one does it quite well for the price. I was looking for a laptop similar to the Surface Pro, or Surface Go. With the necessary accessories (i.e. pen and keyboard) both Surface products cost well over the price tag of this laptop, and even come with lesser specs. This CPU (Ryzen 3500U) is incredible for what I need this laptop for. As an engineering student, I'm certain it could handle programs like MATLAB, SolidWorks, and AutoDesk products.  Vega 8 graphics are good for regular use, but I wouldn't use it for gaming as I wouldn't want to max the thermals out, but Minecraft and Rocket League would run on low-medium if you absolutely need to. The laptop comes with a pen and USB holder for the pen, and the pen works great. It allows me to use my laptop as my notebook for all classes.

PROS: -Sharp 14\" 1080p screen with great colors and great pen accuracy -Battery life easily lasts me 7 hours of use and the charger is very portable. -Slim, light form factor -Very fast, but it is new so I would expect that since it has an SSD. CONS: -Get the higher RAM model, the embedded graphics uses 2 GB of whatever RAM you selected and 6 GB is not enough for school use, 10 GB is though. -Keyboard has a very short travel, takes a while to get used to -Touch pad is mediocre -Pen sometimes has issues with the barrel buttons, very minor gripe. -Build quality is okay at best. Lots of plastic, some flex on the chassis and keyboard, but again, it's relatively cheap. No idea about the longevity of this laptop, but I guess I'll find out in the future. Mine shipped with a year and a half warranty so that is nice.  All-in-all, if you're on a tight budget, this laptop (Ryzen 5 3500U and 12 GB ram) will work great for school.

The holder is the worst: it takes away one of 2 full-sized USB ports itself, but if you want the pen to stay in the pen holder, you have to go horizontal which blocks both USB-A ports and the pathetic SD slot. Pen eats AAA batteries; why is it not rechargeable? It's supposed to be able to be stored vertically but the hole where the pen tip is supposed to rest and fit the pen tip in for stabilization is too far down and the pen just pops out. The pen is accurate but of the two buttons it has, only one seems to work (the right click). The other one seems to be there for decoration or confusing people. Absolute garbage. -SD card sticks so, so far out of the SD card slot: it's around 60-70% exposed. You will snap one of those eventually if you aren't super careful. I haven't, but I've only had it a few days. Why even have it if you can't even make sure the card isn't somewhat protected? -SSD is small.

I bought this to upgrade my old hp laptop (traditional, 2gb ram, centron or idk whatever the spelling was, 500hdd) and this laptop can work as fast as I do. I open a program and it loads up immediately. There's also a powdery feel to the laptop. The screen is bright but I'm using it indoors. It's also glossy so writing with the pen is okay. It doesn't seem cheap, tbh. I had another intention for buying this laptop: for drawing and video editing. I tested gimp, sai and krita and only sai is buttery smooth. However, there's almost no pen sensitivity so I recommend getting an actual drawing tablet. But for note taking, this one will do the job. I don't have the WiFi connectivity issues.

It is much lighter than the 2017 one, it is a bit smaller too but same screen size which is nice. I had ordered a hard shell protective case for it, same brand that i had on my older laptop but it arrived and did not fit. So i have no case on it. This had led me to notice that fingerprints are super noticeable on the front cover. Kinda annoying but i am gonna try and put stickers all over it  The touchscreen works nice, i use it mostly as laptop but is nice when watching videos One thing that i have noticed is my WiFi on this computer seems spotty everywhere once in a while. Ive opened the same website on both my laptops at the same time and my older one with cracked screen loads pages faster. It works fast most of the time but slow speeds happen frequently enough to get a little annoying The battery life seems to last longer too, i haven't tested to see how long it would last me from 100% to being dead, but it takes like 4 hours to go down like 40 percent maybe, so that is nice. I still bring my cord with just in case i need to charge it. It would be cool if the USB c port in the laptop would charge it with a USB c cable but this laptop does not. The brightness is ok, I went into the display settings and manually turned up the brightness and tweaked with the settings to my preferred view. It is bright and colors are good.

I wasn't disappointed, as this laptop packs a lot of bang for buck. The Ryzen 5 3500U has plenty of power to run everything I need, and I haven't had any lagging issues at all. I'm not a huge PC gamer, but I did download The Long Dark, and the laptop runs it just fine.  The build quality is very good; it is mostly plastic, but it really doesn't feel cheap at all. I like the sort of matte finish, soft-touch material on the back of the screen, but it can get kind of fingerprint-y. I'm also no expert on pens for digital art or anything, but the one that was included feels nice and works well for me, and it's nice that it comes with a little holder for it too. Battery life and screen brightness aren't the best I've seen, but definitely adequate. Overall, I think this is one of the best laptops you can get new for around $550. I shopped around quite a bit at Best Buy and other websites, and for the price this thing comes very well-equipped.

For playing less demanding games this laptop is somewhat capable (even some of the more demanding games can be played at lower settings). At $550 I would certainly recommend this laptop. Pros: - Touchscreen + Pen both work properly, although for a web browser like Firefox a couple of settings have to be adjusted for the application to support touch screen. - The keyboard is decent, not on par with Dell Latitudes or Lenovo Thinkpad keyboards but not too far from it and better than what most 2-in-1 convertible laptops offer in terms of build quality. No numpad though. - Battery life is decent as well considering this houses a low 45Wh battery. Likely due to power management working properly with the CPU since the HP Envy x360 15z (2017) with the R5 2500U had poor battery life in comparison. - The BIOS on the laptop has quite a few options such as disabling PSP (a feature I have no plans on using although I can't confirm if it actually does what it's suppose to). Most of the options I set to default although I set the laptop to performance mode when I plan on playing games. Cons: - When the Computer suspends from the battery life being very low (5%) and you resume, the touchscreen and mouse stops working until the system reboots, which is a bit of an inconvenience really, so I would keep the device above that low of a capacity if possible."}, {"name": "MBA", "rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "October 3, 2019", "title": "Wifi chip does not work", "review_text": "The rest of the product is great but it is useless if the wifi connectivity does not work.

Hughes", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "July 30, 2017", "title": "Sort of ruggedized, sort of kindergartenized", "review_text": "I've been a Chromebook fan since 2015. Many people writing reviews on Amazon about their frustrations with certain Chromebooks are almost entirely confused about-- or unfamiliar with-- the OS, so they take it out on the machine. That's not fair or accurate. By way of background, I also need to explain that I bought a pair of ASUS C100PA-DB02 10.1-inch Chromebook flips with touchscreens back in 2015. They have very glossy/shiny screens which glare, but the touch screen feature is nice. They also feature an actual aluminum metal chassis which is very elegant and classy looking (although prone to scratches). I saw this \"ruggedized\" version of a Chromebook on Amazon and thought I'd pick one up. I'm already an Asus fan, I like the Chromebook OS, and I was looking for a more durable Chromebook to literally throw in my backpack or briefcase and head out the door-- without worrying about a sleeve, case, or possible scratches if none of these was used. Well, this \"ruggedized\" version looks like it'd be great for children. Not so great for professional adults who've been spoiled with the nicer Chromebooks or laptops. I don't mean to be harsh because the chassis isn't awful, but it does have more of a look of Fisher Price or Leapfrog than Apple or PC. The Screen: The screen on this laptop is dimmer and more grainy (of that makes sense) than my other two laptops (both my other Chromebook and a PC laptop). The screen is anti-glare to be sure (a good thing), but you can sort of see a matrix pattern on the screen (a bad thing). The colors are also ever-so-slightly more washed out and dull. I compared all the screens side-by-side. If you're a student or a parent buying this for a child in grade-school, I don't think you'll be disappointed. If you're a photographer, visual artist, or someone who with a keen eye who enjoys HD movies, you'll notice that this screen is simply not up to par with other laptops on the market. The Keys: The keys on this laptop are my biggest frustration. While many keyboards today are back-lit, that would be a luxury on a Chromebook. Fair enough. But is it too much to ask for high-contrast silk screening? Maybe a phosphorescent or white print color for the keys? Apparently so. This keyboard has mid-to-dark-blue lettering on black keys. A really, really stupid choice that makes no scientific or practical sense other than to match the color blue to the \"ruggedized\" cover trim. These keys will be hard to see in low-lighting. Lastly, the keys on this keyboard are noticeably taller than on my other Asus Chromebook. Probably twice as tall. You feel like you're typing on a manual typewriter. Very poor design choice. Summary: If I were a parent, I'd buy my kid this laptop in a heartbeat. It's compact, durable, water-resistant, has excellent battery life, access to the Internet, if used with Google Drive and Google Docs all work is saved and backed-up automatically, the laptop is somewhat immune to viruses, and it's certainly rugged. However, if I were a college student and wanted all the above *plus* the ability to really enjoy streaming movies and to comfortably type-up term papers for hours on end, I'd probably get a Chromebook with a nicer screen and better keyboard. Sadly, for me, this laptop was a no-go and I'll be returning it. Sticking with the aluminum Asus 2-in-1 with touchscreen. If you found this review, please give me a thumbs up.

I am a writer and I needed something simple without a lot of bells and whistles and whips and chains :)  This little Chromebook netbook is awesome for traveling.  It takes a little bit to get used to Chrome's operating system, but once you do you'll discover some very nice proprietary advantages. A small\u2014but nice thing\u2014is not having to right click any more; instead, you simply tap with two fingers for word corrections.  This is great for someone like me who writes a lot and needs to have a simplified workflow. The battery is long lasting and the keyboard is a perfect size, even for someone as big as I am. 6'3\" 300. Because I use google docs to write with, this seemed a natural step. Chromebook seamlessly integrates Google Docs, and most other important apps into the framework of the little machine, so it's very easy to use and get started. The offline stuff is very useful too as I'm not always in a place where there's wifi and I can still work on my books. Another nice feature is how light it is.  My wife bought a laptop a couple years ago and she would share it with me (begrudgingly) and I always hated working on it because it was big, heavy, and clunky.  This little Chromebook weighs next to nothing and is easy to tote around. All in all, I'd give this 10 stars if I could\u2014especially considering the price.

Of course it's limited in many, many ways, but that's the whole point of buying a Chromebook. I've been using this device for a little over half a semester in college for in class note taking, group work, etc. I use my desktop for any heavy duty stuff. It's worth noting that I rollerblade to classes, so I was looking for something as light as possible and as durable as possible. Pros: Very sturdy - I've dropped it many times and the worst that has happened is the rubber edging will have to be popped back into place. Simple as that and it feels totally firm and solid once it's back in place. It's great to not have to treat your laptop like the slightest bump could damage it. Fantastic keyboard - The keyboard has a nice \"chunk\" with each keystroke. The keys have enough travel and require enough force to avoid accidental keystrokes and typing feels great, even satisfying. Great battery life - I never bring my charger with me anymore, no matter how long I expect to be out. Good sunlight readability -  The screen does a pretty fine job of reducing strong glare. Cons: Weight - Though it's not particularly heavy for a Chromebook, its weight is a significant addition to my backpack. At just over two pounds, however, it's not a huge compromise in return for how durable this machine is. Sometime slow - As you'd expect. But honestly Chrome does a good enough job of managing resources that I only notice severe lag when opening presentations with many elements in them. All in all, this Chromebook has exceeded my expectations!"}, {"name": "Amazon Customer", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "September 8, 2017", "title": "In-Depth Review Sep 2017 - Great Product That Over-delivers", "review_text": "Great Chromebook! Bought as a replacement for my Lenovo Ideapad 310, AMD A12, 8GB Ram. The main reason for the replacement was battery life. Only getting 2-3 hours on the Lenovo, I needed something that could handle my digital nomad lifestyle. PROS: Battery Life - You can easily get 8-9 hours with moderate usage. Performance - I was a tad bit concerned with this factor, but with: ----- 21 tabs open ----- Keypress Editior (coding app from Chrome Store) ----- Webserver for Chome (running a local server for web dev, from Chrome Store) ----- Box SVG (creating & editing vector graphics app from Chrome Store) ----- Polarr (a really good image editior from Chrome Store) ----- Enjoy Music Player (another Chrome Store app) I haven't experienced any significant slow downs. Opening large SVG files or any other larger file, slows the system for a second or two (acceptable). Keyboard - I love typing on this keyboard. Even though it's smaller than my Lenovo, I type faster. Keys are well spaced and feel good to press. Also the key font size is a small aesthetic that you'll appreciate. Build Quality - I won't lie, it's ugly, but it feels very solid in hand. I'm not moving it around like it's a new born baby, as I was with my Lenovo. I can quickly take it out my backpack and slap it on a desk. All the ports feel strong and sturdy. My flash drive does not wiggle while inserted. Screen - It's good for the price, nice matte finish. I haven't had the urge to go back to my Lenovo (15.6) to watch a video or movie. It gets bright and dim to my satisfaction, nuff said. Charge Time - A fast charging device wasn't on my feature list, but this baby is fully charged from 35% in less than 1 hour. Better than my lenovo...I'll take it. Trackpad - It does what I expect and is perfectly placed. My only gripe is how loud actual clicks are, everyone at Starbucks will know when you double-click. Chrome OS - FYI, I'm coming from Ubuntu Desktop. From a bird's eye view Chrome OS may seem limited, but once you dig around the Chrome Store, you'll start finding apps for all your problems and fairly decent app replacements. Furthermore, there are a plethora of web apps outside the Chrome Store to compensate most people's unique necessities. Chrome OS + Google Play - In my opinion these two paired eliminate the \"OS Limits\". If you ever used Android, then you'll know there's an app for everything. I personally haven't even needed the Play Store yet, so I actually disabled it. Storage - I thought this would be an issue, but Google Drive is integrated very well. You get 120GB free for 2 years. You can also expand your local memory with SD card or flash drive. I always keep a flash drive backup. Speakers - As you can tell, I'm not super picky. These speakers get the job done, better than my Lenovo. I don't find myself plugging in my headphones to hear things better as I do with my phone and laptop. They get loud enough for me. Wifi - This was another huge issue I had with my Lenovo, mainly because I was using linux. Asus definitely delivers, connections are always strong and never drop. I'm using this Chromebook in the same locations as I did with the Lenovo. Bluetooth - I couldn't get it to connect with my phone. The pair would instantly drop. I haven't looked for a solution. I sure a bluetooth mouse or headset will work. It's well documented that not all phones pair with Chromebooks. Weight & Portability - It's nice and small, easy to carry around in hand as well as light on the back. Has a great rubber strip on bottom, that not only holds grip on tables and laps better than any other laptop I've owned, but allows it to be carried around like a spiraled notebook. Love Factor - It may be ugly, but I just love using it. It can do more than my phone and suitably replaces my laptop. Easy to carry around, not fragile, well built. It's the perfect piece of technology to augment yourself.

There was not an impact or damage to cause this.  It is essentially non-working at this point.  I called ASUS to check about the warranty.  I was told that I had to pay the shipping to send it back, it would be gone at least 7-10 business days, and the manufacturer would deem if it was \"manufacturer defect or user damage.\"  If it was deemed damaged, we would be responsible for all repairs. After the phone conversation, I have no confidence that this company would take responsibility for it's defective product. I will not pay the money for shipping just for them then say it was damaged, when in fact it wasn't.  Please, save yourself $200 and buy another product by another manufacturer.

Setup is super easy and it runs incredibly fast. Many other computers take at least 2-3 minutes before I can do anything with them, but not this one! I can immediately get online and access documents without waiting or getting frustrated. The speakers are pretty good for the size of the computer, nothing super loud or anything, but definitely good and clear sound. The keyboard's letters are a light blue color and bigger than most other's. That does not make a very big difference to me, but it would help someone just learning how to use a keyboard or whose vision is not too great. I personally am not a huge fan of the touch pad because most of the time it is difficult or impossible to left click anything, but that was easily solvable by using a small, portable wireless mouse. It does effortlessly keep track of social media notifications, especially Facebook, which is a good but not overall necessary feature, at least for me. It has a good design and definitely would hold up to short distance drops or a little bit of water. I often take this to school and at times it sits in my hot car, but it always manages to work great when in use. My favorite feature of this computer? The battery life. Hands down, the battery life on its own is unbeatable. It lasts at the very least ten hours and I can get anywhere from 3-5 days use on one charge.

My wife and I own a Dell desk top computer which we share between the two of us. I'll be going back to school in the spring and we thought it might be nice to have an extra computer around the house so we could both work on projects, or watch videos, or whatever at the same time. Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of money to spend so I really did my research before purchasing. I spent less than $200 for this little Chromebook and I think I really got my money's worth. With the exception of the storage capacity (which can be easily upgraded with an SD Card), it seems to be on a par with MacBook Air but for less than a third the cost. It's fast, easy to use, light weight, and durable. The last two qualities are especially important to me because I'm a cyclist and a strap hanger. If you travel primarily by automobile, you can't fully grok how important it is for someone who travels primarily by bicycle and/or bus to pack light and have durable, water resistant gear. It isn't mentioned in the product description, but I was pleasantly surprised that this Chromebook came with a 12 month accident protection warranty. To me that says a lot about Asus' confidence in the durability of their product. Admittedly, I am a big time Google user. I've had a gmail account for years and I use all the wonderful products - Drive (docs, sheets, slides, and drawings), Voice (both phone and sms), Hangouts, Keep, Calendar, etc - that google has. If you're like me in this you'll be very happy to see that this Chromebook is a natural extension of your blissful Google experience. One thing I would strongly recommend to anyone who decides to purchase this product is that you explore the help (?) section soon after you start it up for the first time. This is a Chrome OS so its slightly different than a Mac or Windows OS and will take a little getting used to. It's very intuitive and user friendly but you'll save yourself a lot of frustration if you take an hour to learn how to use it. All in all, I think this is an extraordinary product and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive, very portable computer for school or work.

It's a great compact size, is fast as lightning, runs Android apps (after switching the OS to the Beta channel) flawlessly, and works well with USB drives, memory cards, Bluetooth devices, and more. The lightweight footprint of the operating system is a plus because it boots and computes faster than most Windows laptops. The design of the device is rugged and feels very well made.

At work I don't even need use it on a desk, just on my lap because it's small and comfortable enough. Furthermore, the ruggedized design makes it really protected, yet the thing is so light, I feel very safe if I were ever to drop it mostly because it doesn't weigh like other laptops. The ruggedized design, is strong I'm sure, but it's more like icing on the cake. Speed and processor: I have no issues with speed and opening multiple windows whatsoever.

Assuming it works perfectly, you need to wait about 20 seconds between clicking to open a document and actually being able to edit it. Sometimes it doesn't work perfectly, you need to log back into your account. Sometimes you try logging in and it doesn't work for some reason.

Then you finally get logged into Google Docs, you start writing your document and have a bad Internet connection for whatever reason.

I finally settled on this Chromebook, and man I'm glad I did. I was skeptical after reading all the reviews but I'm skeptical about everything these days. So in some of the reviews I saw complaints about screen quality, a cap lock button not working etc. Well, it's a Chromebook so it does not have a cap lock button, so that's a non issue. The screen quality doesn't compare to my iMac, but I wasn't expecting it to, my iMac cost me $1,300 and this Chromebook cost me $216. The screen quality I think is amazing for the price. It's not bad at all. It's not like playing an Atari or the old Sega genesis we had as kids lol. All in all I bought 3 of these Chromebooks and I think they are a great buy! They are very speedy for my slow internet connection and everything functions flawlessly and did I mention they are really easy to set up and operate!? This is just what I needed for the kids. Now I can stay organized with all of my kids school work, no fighting over my expensive desktop and the kids have everything they need in a compact Chromebook. I couldn't be happier with my purchase! They are plenty rugged (mind you they are still a delicate electronic device, I don't care how rugged anyone claims an electronic device to be, my children are going to be taught to treat then very delicately!). But they are rugged enough where I feel if there was a minor accidental drop etc, they would be fine. I say go for it! We love ours!!

I bought this pint sized device less than 6 months ago and it's already acting up. The random black outs mid task are driving me up a wall (although it takes less than a minute or two to reboot itself) no one should have to deal with that. Also, sometimes it will freeze if I'm watching a video followed by the loading circle \"not responding\" icon, that's fun too. I'm not one of those Internet users with tons of tabs or apps open 24/7 so I don't understand the crashes. There isn't a designated caps lock button, it is replaced with a search button instead... something that I personally do not care to ever use! On the bright side, it can be tweaked into being a caps lock button in the settings thankfully. (Random: there is no number keys on the right side either, just your designated numbers on the top row of the keyboard, it's compact so that's understandable...)

Well you can, but you won't be able to open it obviously. It's not readable.

She had no suggestion of where to go to find one or how I should make sure I got the right one, but just that I buy a charger and try it.  Really not helpful. So I asked what else we could do.  She suggested that I send it in.  Fine.  So now we are sending the notebook in, It will take 7-10 business days - so 2 or three weeks considering the upcoming holidays plus shipping time.  So we will now be out of use of this notebook which we really need for a month. She did offer me expedited return shipping at $30 but that's not really helpful. She also suggested I back up all my data before I ship it to them. Of course I can't power the thing on. So I asked her how I should go about doing that.  She suggested I take it to a local repair person to back up the data and that this person would be able to power it on and pull the data off.  No suggestions of where to go for that but apparently there is someone out there near me who can do this.  I guess.

So far I really enjoy this laptop and use it every day. I  rarely used my old  hp laptop because it was heavy and ran slow until I decided to factory reset it but saw a \"refresh laptop\" option instead and installed another 4gb ram (8gb ram total). I was skeptical about this chromebook because it's only 4gb ram and hardly has memory but everything gets saved to your Google drive. I did a little bit of research when I was laptop shopping and read that chromebooks don't need a lot of ram to run faster because they have an  SSD instead of the old HHD. So I narrowed my search down to a Windows PC with 8gb ram and an SSD or a chromebook! A good windows PC with those specs would've cost me $500+. I started my laptop search without knowing ANYTHING about computer specs and what they meant but you can go on YouTube or Google and find out what's best for you. This laptop definitely isn't for everyone but I've been able to use it for all my needs. It isn't like a Mac or Windows pc where you can download programs and add them to your desktop but you can download apps from the Google play store like you would on a phone or tablet. I would definitely recommend this chromebook for people who just want to browse the internet, watch videos, download apps in the play store, and people who are scared of getting viruses. I read that it's much harder to get a virus on a chromebook than on a Windows PC. This is perfect for kids or people who are likely to catch viruses.

Totally random failure Rock solid little guy, of course google-chrome is terrible, but I always ran crouton(linux), but now that fails post nov-2018, so I'm using the new google supported 'linux' its ok, but very limited in memory/storage, as the google virtual box, doesn't let you use the external devices, which means your linux is limited to a total of about 8gb for all sys&apps, which ain't much if your running R&PYTHON and doing light development. Great little laptop, much better than ACER ( in terms of reliability ), but now I'm seeing that the infant mortality ain't forever, that 2+ years these little guys start failing.

But now that crouton doesn't work well with the newer version of chrome, your stuck with the new google version of linux, but for the virtual box doesn't support anything outside of a tiny virtual space allocated out of the 16gb total memory, remember if you move up to say 64/128gb chromebooks your talking almost $1,000, so its clear that this C202 is an entry, and the PAIN threshold is to get you to move to APPLE PRICING.

Like another reviewer mentioned, it almost seems like a toy computer. It is about twice the thickness of my previous computer and there is a ridge on the base that I guess is supposed to help you grip it? I haven't found that particularly useful, but it does put the keyboard at a slight angle, which I like. Speaking of the keyboard, the keys are raised and the labels are bright blue (another reason it looks like a toy), which makes it easier to type on than most laptops I've used, but there is a noticeable clicking sound when typing. The trackpad also makes a clicking sound, and doesn't seem as sensitive as my other computer, two-finger (right) clicking is particularly difficult. My main complaint is the screen brightness, or lack thereof. It looks like an old desktop monitor, kind of dull and almost pixelated.

The whole keyboard pops off the base and there are two small ribbon cables attaching it. These cables are released by flipping up little \"doors\" on the receptacles and then the cable lifts out. There is a flat metal heat sink that goes over the battery held on by 4 screws. A 3rd ribbon cable crosses over the battery and plugs in to a circuit board using the same flip door receptacle as the other two. The battery has its own small plug that plugs into the circuit board.

It feels great to hold and use. The only thing I would say holds the laptop back is the chromeOS. If this came with no OS or something like Linux Mint or Ubuntu it would be absolutely perfect. But the chromeOS makes doing a lot of things a hassle. Its possible to replace the OS but its a really big pain and probably not something the majority of users would be able to do comfortably. The only good thing about the chromeOS that I liked was how quickly it turns back on. But thats only because the laptop never really fully turns off. It just goes into a sort of sleep/standby mode. With that said I'd hate to give this laptop anything less than a 5/5 because the laptop itself is really high quality and even though the chromeOS isn't the best it still is doing the job I needed it for. Pros Light and portable. Quick to turn on. (Because it never fully turns off) Great for just browsing the internet or watching/streaming video. Has a great look and feel to it. Good build quality. Fairly easy to take apart. The mouse takes a little getting used to but once you do get used to it its a very good mouse. Cons Pretty much all of the cons are to do with the chromeOS Poor compatibility with software. (You are limited mostly to google playstore apps unless you want to really work hard to install things.) Computer never fully turns off. (Both a pro and a con) Have to take the computer apart and void the warranty just to get full control of the device. Very small amount of storage space. (I ended up buying a small low profile flashdrive and use that for storage) If you are just going to use this as a laptop to browse the internet on or maybe do some banking on its the perfect laptop. If you had other plans I'd highly recommend getting a laptop that has windows installed even if you want to later install a linux OS its far easier to do that from windows than it would be from chromeOS."}, {"name": "anotherconsumer", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "November 6, 2019", "title": "weather resistant chromebook gets more outdoor time than my tablet", "review_text": "ASUS build is solid, water resistant, claims 10 hr battery (more like 9 plus so far) and handles Android apps now.

Yes. Worth buying? Yes!  Perfect?  Not exactly...", "review_text": "As I write this, the Acer Chromebook 14 is sitting with 13 reviews, all of which are 5 stars... and I do feel a little bit bad here breaking up the perfect game, but after using this Chromebook for a few days, I feel I have an obligation to point out both its strengths and its drawbacks. Even writing that, I can't say I'm completely surprised by all of the 5 star reviews, as there are a lot of things that this Chromebook gets right. There are five key things worth highlighting here. First: the screen. Many of Acer's Chromebooks have, historically, been hampered by their poor displays. Thankfully, this time, Acer has gotten that part right. The Chromebook 14 has a 1080p IPS display with fantastic viewing angles and excellent brightness. I keep it at about 60-70% and it looks fantastic. It feels wonderful to finally say that about an Acer display. Second: the build materials. Chromebooks have generally been budget-friendly devices, but recently we've started to see some that are either mid-range and high quality (like the Dell 13) or are upper-low end budget devices that still use more premium build materials, like the Asus C100P \"Flip\" and now, the Acer Chromebook 14. Note that I said build materials, and not build quality. Third: 4GB RAM, 32GB local storage. A more recent trend among Chrome OS devices is the inclusion of 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, instead of the 2GB/16GB to which we've become accustomed. For a lot of users, the local storage limitation isn't a big deal, as without applications, local storage isn't that critical... but it is nice for people who like to locally store music, photos, and movies, or who intent to install Crouton (or are looking ahead to the possibility of Android apps). The extra RAM, however, is great for everyone, as it makes this device more capable of running many tabs, or handling higher demand tasks like streaming content, without tabs crashing out or caching/reloading. Fourth: Intel N3160 quad-core processor. This processor isn't exactly going to light the world on fire, but for most of what folks do with a Chromebook, it is going to be adequate, and it provides a user experience that feels significantly faster and more responsive than the N3050 on Windows 10 or Chrome OS, and is also more responsive in Chrome here than the x5-Z8300 is in Windows 10 (such as you'd see in the Intel Compute Stick or Asus E200HA). Fifth: $299. When you stack up all these strengths and offer them at a price of $299, you're getting a fairly impressive value proposition here with this Chromebook. The screen is great, for both media consumption and general computing/web browsing; it offers a nice amount of local storage and solid performance via the Intel processor and 4GB of RAM, and it looks sharp, thanks to modern design queues and aluminum build materials. What's not to love here, right? Well........ I hate to be \"that\" guy, but there's a few things to pick at here. I keep reading comments along the lines of: \"Forget the Dell Chromebook 13 / Toshiba Chromebook 2 2015, this is the Chromebook to get!\" And for a lot of people, that's likely true, but I certainly won't say that's true as a blanket statement. Let's start with the Dell Chromebook 13. It has a smaller screen footprint, but is thicker and about the same weight, with a similar screen quality (and a tendency for backlight bleed); however, it packs a much more solid construction and a significantly more premium \"feel\" throughout, including its trackpad, keyboard, and overall feel in hand. It also has much better performance, including an easily upgraded M.2 SSD that has faster read/write speeds and much more flexibility for those looking to install Crouton (to use Linux). That last part is a small subset of users, but it is still worth noting; however, the performance and build quality gap are very real and will be notable to all users. And, of course, the Dell can be purchased with an even faster Intel Core i3 or i5, and can also be upgraded to a touchscreen, which again may be significant if Android apps come to Chrome OS. What about the Toshiba Chromebook 2 2015? Things are less clear here; the Toshiba again has better performance, and uses a real SSD, but it has less impressive build quality and even less impressive materials; it does offer a backlit keyboard and an even nicer screen, still the nicest of these three. I think that a lot of Toshiba customers should probably consider the Acer, but those who were aboard the Dell train for its build quality and performance will likely still want to move forward with that device instead of this one; if I had to choose between the two, I'd likely go Dell... but then again, budget isn't my number one concern. At $300, this is a great purchase... ...which leads me to my next point, the omnipresent comments about \"This feels like a $1000 computer!\" or \"This is just like a MacBook Air for $300!\" The problem is that neither of those statements are close to accurate, and have to be chalked up to pure enthusiasm and excitement. For instance, the $799 Dell XPS 13 feels remarkably better to use than this Acer does, as it has smaller bezels, a much nicer trackpad, a much better (backlit) keyboard, and far faster web browsing and general performance. And while the Acer does resemble a MacBook Air 13 from a distance, when you compare them in-hand, any talk of them being similar will disappear. The Acer is very nice, to be sure, especially considering the price or $299, but tapping the trackpad results in a hollow response compared to the MacBook's assured sturdiness, and the keyboard lacks the superb feel and response you find in a MacBook keyboard. The Acer may copy the MacBook's style, but it doesn't approach it's premium feel when you actually use it. This isn't say the Acer is bad in the abstract; far from it. It has a nice, oversize trackpad that - like pretty much all Chromebooks - is responsive and a pleasure to use. And, its keyboard is comfortable if unremarkable. It also has pretty decent I/O with two USB 3.0 ports, HDMI, and also 802.11ac WiFi. It does unfortunately lack an SD or Micro-SD card slot, however. I can't help but feel that people are also slightly exaggerating the performance offered by the N3160. It is solid, and does a decent job rendering pages, and paired with the extra RAM here, it adequately handles streaming content in the background - such as YouTube or Spotify - and still maintains a decent browsing experience across eight to ten additional tabs; but realistically speaking, this Chromebook offers slower performance than the $199 Acer C720 from late 2013. Octane 2.0 benchmarks I ran in Guest mode scored around 8,000 to 8,200 which, again, is not horrible, but isn't much more impressive than budget devices using the Rockchip 3288 from last year (like the $149 Hisense Chromebook). I only mention this because, in my opinion, you're getting about $300 worth of performance here; anyone telling you this device runs like a $500 or $800 computer is exaggerating. My Dell i3 Chromebook is much faster at loading tabs in general, especially busy ones like CNN.com, as is my MacBook Air 2014. There's a very real performance gap here when compared to more expensive devices, but also when compared to Chromebooks running on the Intel 2955U or 3205U/3215U, which in the case of the latter Broadwell chips can churn out Octane scores nearly double what the Acer 14 offers. None of this means the Acer Chromebook 14 is a bad Chromebook; on the contrary, it is an excellent Chromebook! I led with those first five points for a reason: being able to purchase a decently-performing Chromebook with aluminum build, a 1080p IPS display, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of local storage, and an Intel quad-core processor for $299 is basically what the entirely of the ChromeOS subreddit has been asking for over the past few years; as such I have to tip my had to Acer and commend them on building a very nice Chromebook for the consumer space, one which should do a great job converting people to the idea of Chrome OS. That doesn't mean that I can't be disappointed in the lack of an SD card slot, the hollow feel and sound of the trackpad, the quite average keyboard, the feeling that the \"premium\" build quality is really just a nice \"coat of paint\" so to speak, the solidly average performance which is exceeded by devices 2.5 years old or matched by Chromebooks at half the price, the absence of a touchscreen upgrade, or the use of slower eMMC storage instead of a real M.2 SSD. These are all valid points that probably make this more of a 4.5 star device than a true 5 stars. Worth buying? Heck yes! But perfect? Not so much. And please, everyone, stop saying this is a $300 Chromebook that is nicer and faster than a $1000 MacBook or PC, because if you've really used those devices, you know it isn't true... even if it sounds great in a review."}, {"name": "James Beswick", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "April 30, 2016", "title": "Finally a beautiful, high-spec'd machine firing on all cylinders for Chromebook powerusers", "review_text": "For Chromebook fans, one persistent nagging issue has been the generally under-powered hardware for users who really push their machines - once you have a dozen or so tabs open with a half dozen extensions, many Chromebooks can start to slow down noticeably. Until now, the only option available has been the $1000 Pixel which is a beautiful PC but way beyond the budget for this kind of device. Acer has identified the Chromebook market gaps and solved almost everything in this extremely solid offering - a thin, metal, almost Mac-like build, armed with 4GB of RAM, a full 14\" HD display and a Quad-core CPU. Even the touchpad and keyboard perform as well as the very best Chromebooks currently available (which, until now, I would have said were built by Dell and Samsung). The performance never lags, it meets the 10-12 hour battery life promise in my usage tests, and it's quickly become my go-to computer for both home and work. If you're new to Chromebooks, here's what to expect from this Acer machine and the O.S. generally - these are genuinely 'instant-on' machines, highly secure and tightly integrated into Google's suite of apps and tools. Anything that runs in a Chrome browser on a desktop or laptop will run on a Chromebook, and there are novel app-like extensions for almost anything else (calculator apps, command lines, etc.) For an office, you can give everyone a Chromebook and their environment becomes available on login and disappears when they sign-out, and the machines can also be remotely managed if you're a Google Apps customer. For home users, these cheap machines fit many use cases from casual browsing and two-screening, to watching videos and calling family. They're ideal for elderly parents and in-laws who might other spam their own machines with malware since Chromebooks are much harder to break than a Windows 7/8/10 PC. For students and road warriors, the extended battery life and automatic cloud integration makes sync-ing a breeze, especially if you hotspot from your phone. And as with many other Chromebooks, this Acer also comes with some additional freebies such as 100GB of Drive space, Google Music and a dozen in-air Gogo passes (worth over $100 alone). As a 5-year Chromebook veteran, I've been waiting for this machine. It takes the basic premise of the simplicity and security of the Chrome O.S and matches it with high quality hardware at a value price.

I do a lot of development in the cloud, and make use of a lot of resources on the net, and so reasoned I didn't need to cart around a regular laptop.  Since I obviously do a lot of typing, I hoped for decent keyboard-- and was pleasantly surprised.  The keyboard on this unit is actually quite nice.  And let's be real.  The majority of things we do everyday on a computer is covered by a Chromebook, and it's large array of available apps and extensions (to Chrome).  Certainly for specialized uses, we can't completely untether ourselves from a full on laptop or desktop running Linux, OS X, or Windows.  But Chromebooks do fill a niche. I just received delivery of this, and set it up.  One thing I didn't like about Chromebooks that I've looked at in the past was their cheesy shells and keyboards, and the cost of a decent one.  This unit not only has a nice aluminum shell (which is very attractive), but it also has a decent keyboard, with much better tactile properties than any Chromebooks I've looked at in the past.  It actually looks and feels like a laptop, instead of some plastic toy. The hardware specs on this are very nice compared to other offerings:  4G Ram, 32G storage, Quad-core processor, etc.  The screen is beautiful, and the speakers are very nice.  Better in fact than some of my laptops.  The mouse area is responsive, and has a nice feel to it.  The overall unit has a slim profile, and is light weight. When I was comparing this model against other manufacturer's / model's, the only thing that made me pause was the lack of a card reader/writer.  Ultimately, what I decided was that: (a) with google drive, microsoft drive, box, dropbox, etc., there is no good reason to require a reader/writer, as I can simply save and download whatever I want from the cloud, and (b) 32GB is plenty of local storage for a Chromebook.

There are two iterations of this chromebook the C5EX and the C5FM. The advertised model is the C5FM. You may, as I did, recieve the C5EX instead with a newly printed label slapped over the older C5EX label on the box (chromebook itself retains proper C5EX badging). This may sour some buyer's experience; however, there is only one functional difference between the two models. C5FM (the advertised model has an SSD) and the C5EX (model I recieved has eMMC). Yes, SSDs do have faster read/write times, as well as, better and upgradeable firmeare than eMMC - so there IS a difference between the two models.

I use the Gmail app an I cannot determine how to delete an email without using the trashcan icon and the trackpad. The keyboard is okay. The trackpad is mediocre in use. At one point I had high hopes that this would be a very stable platform, but after using it extensively, the minimize/maximize controls disappear and applications cannot be easily closed and a reboot is required to restore normal operation. Most of the time it works very well and one is subject to the vagaries of the various apps, browser, etc. The speakers are mediocre and don't put out too much volume and are sensitive to position. I have yet to try it with headphones. I find the screen resolution to be very good for video. I really don't have much experience with other Chromebooks other than a few that were far worse in all respects than this machine.

They're like a little-known gem, practically unknown in my area, where Macs still rule. I borrowed a Chromebook before, and I was impressed with its speed and simplicity. I have mixed feelings about this Acer Chromebook. Like the other one I borrowed, this one feels streamlined and easy to use. It seems more intuitive than Macs or Windows. I like how it's so simple, without so much clutter and complexity. It's easy find and delete pics and files you've downloaded. Things don't get lost as easily, and you don't have to dig around for stuff as much as on a Mac or Windows computer. The keyboard and touchpad are awful on this Chromebook. Like other budget laptops, the keys feel cheap and uncomfortable. They have a low-quality, hard plastic feel and a weird textured grain to them. I wouldn't want to do any extensive typing on it. The touchpad is hard and clunky. Even using it a bit makes my hands/wrist uncomfortable. This would be best used with a mouse. Doing general internet surfing is a breeze on this laptop. Overall, it works well and is easy to use. If you're mainly on YouTube or reading stuff online, this Chromebook functions well for that purpose. I still haven't figured out Google Cloud Print. I've Googled, but still haven't found an easy way to print. I've learned that most external devices, like printers and cameras, work best with Windows computers. With Macs and Chromebooks, you might run into a lot of problems and bugs. It's all integrated with your Google account, but I'd prefer to not have that. I suppose you can sign in without using your Google account, but I haven't tried that yet. Believe it or not, the webcam on this laptop DOES NOT have a video function! You can only take still pics with it. You can't Skype, video chat, or record video on this. Acer really tried to cut corners to keep this a budget laptop, and surprisingly, they decided to not have a video function on the webcam. This seems like almost a deal breaker for me, but I'm keeping this as a backup or additional laptop. There are extensions that have video, but I haven't found one yet that works well and can function as a typical laptop webcam. The video extensions tend to be productivity apps that you integrate with work-related stuff, with the video as one of the many functions on it. There's no easy and obvious way to use different browsers on this. There are extensions for IE and Safari, but then, they've failed to download on this Chromebook. I think they're blocking you from using other browsers. The extension industry seems to be very limited and subpar for Chromebooks. They are still a pretty small percentage of the computer market, so developers aren't spending the time or expense to develop good, usable Chromebook extensions for obvious things. I'm still keeping this as a backup or additional laptop because of its cheap price. It's still good for basic internet usage. PROS: Streamlined and simple; easy to use overall; easy to find/delete pics & files; good price; looks nice from the outside, with the lid down; good 14\" screen size that's surprisingly hard to find CONS: Webcam doesn't have video - only takes pics; awful, uncomfortable keyboard & trackpad; Chromebook extensions are lacking and don't address/make up for the limitations of this Chromebook; a bit heavy and clunky; hard to figure out Google Cloud print"}, {"name": "Douglas F.

It really hit all the marks we were looking for. I hadn't had a Chromebook before so I wanted to give it a try and at this price (around $250 at the time) it made sense to pull the trigger. It has surpassed both our expectations. First, getting a quad core processor and a 32GB SSD. Add in the INCLUDED 100GB of Google Drive storage and it's really perfect We knew when we bought them that this model was getting Google Play Store access (keep in mind not all Chromebooks are getting that) and was pleasantly surprised by also getting the Linux VM support that just came out. IT's a great size to throw into a backpack and a solid build quality (all metal) that I don't worry about it getting damaged on my commute. So why 4 stars? Frst, it would have been incredible to have a MicroSD card slot. Secondly, I can't put my finger on it, maybe it's an anti-glare screen that ever so slightly mutes colors, but it's not my favorite device to watch media on.

This Acer is the third computer that I bought in replacement, so I feel I'm in a pretty good position to judge where it stands relative to what else it out there right now. I'm a Chrome OS early adopter, having bought one of the early Chromebox's that were given out at the Google I/O off of eBay, and having bought my Toshiba Chromebook a couple of years ago. I'm somewhat sold on Chrome, the feature I like best about them is that the continuous updating and cleaning up of the OS. My Chromebox is about four years old and it works better now than when I bought it, and that's with zero attention paid to updating/upgrading/virus protection/etc. ever. It \"just works\" and it doesn't stop just working. So my first choice was the SUS C300SA-DS02 Chromebook 13.3\" HD, which sells for about $225 on Amazon. It wasn't a horrible computer, but it looks and feels very cheap and underpowered. So I sent it back and instead ordered an ASUS ZenBook UX305UA 13.3-inch. It was of course much nicer, and I was looking forward to putting Windows Office on it so that I could get some more work functionality out of it. But I was amazed to learn that ASUS Windows laptops, apparently all of them, lock the function keys in such a way that you have to simultaneously press the function key in order to perform their non-function functions (i.e. if you press \"F12\" by itself you get the developer's code window rather than volume up), and it cannot be changed. It's hardwired into the computer, not even opening the BIOS can change it. That was a plain non-starter for me, I'm constantly fiddling with volume and brightness controls on my laptops, so having that as a two-hand operation . . . no way. So . . . reconsidering also the extremely marginal functionality of native Windows Office as opposed to Google Docs/Office Online, I decided to go back to another Chromebook, but this time the Acer Chromebook 14. Boy am I glad I did! This computer looks and feels like a $1000 laptop. It's a beautiful, solid all-metal device, with a nice, wide great looking screen. The trackpad works well, and the internals seem to be very quick, I haven't noticed any stuttering on anything as of yet. My only quibble might be with the keyboard, which is a bit shallow for my tastes, but it's decent enough. At $300 even, you'd be crazy to settle for one of the $200+ Chromebook when a vastly better machine can be had for just a little bit more.

After looking around I decided I wanted to try a chromebook with 4Gb/32Gb combo for $200 or less.  I couldn't find that anywhere and most models were 768 resolution,I was about to give up on chromebooks.  Then this guy showed up with ram and storage I was looking for, 1080 screen and aluminum slim chassis was a huge plus in my opinion which convinced me to bump my budget $50.  I was looking at Dells offerings and they were thick plastic, to get what I wanted kept pushing me to $300+ plus range, and had trouble finding a screen better than 768.  The Acer was a no brainer for me.  When I unboxed it, I noticed it had more bulk than I was expecting, nothing terrible, weight seems to be toward the hinge, must be where the battery is located.  The aluminum is cold to the skin at first touch, but much better conductor for cooling I would imagine than plastic.  I am a guy with no patience for slow PCs so I was leary about what I was getting myself into with a chrome book.  It is surprisingly quick to boot and sleep/awaken, something Windows still struggles with.  Google play store has all the apps I use in Windows and I have only had for a few days so I am still honeymooning with it but so far I like it a lot.  I spent quite some time streaming Youtube with its first full charge and I had at least a full 8 hours out of it, I would suspect if I was just browsing and didn't have the display cranked I could have gotten more.  I was also impressed with the sound quality that it had while watching videos.  I have a strange new obsession watching train crossings live on youtube lately and the trains look clear and the horns sounded authentic, I had to turn it down so I didn't anger the wife watching TV.  The display is crisp and has a wide viewing angle, it doesn't have that funky LCD color fade if the screen is tilted the wrong direction slightly and is somewhat matte to reduce glare.  The keyboard has shallow keys that take a little getting used to and the mouse pad takes a little more pressure than I think it should need to click so sometimes I need to take an extra half second to realize I need to push harder.  I have converted to tapping the pad instead of clicking because it easier, right clicking is accomplished with using a two finger tap.  Only thing I really wish it had was illuminated keyboard, but that can be remedied with a USB light for $10 which will likely affect battery life, it's kind of cheesy solution but for the price point I think I am asking a lot.  I have recommended this to people I know and I would also to you, I don't think you will find anything better than this for the price today.  Just remember it is a Chromebook and not a full PC it has some limitations but I have been impressed with its performance.  I loaded Hearthstone just to see how it would run, it had long load times but once I was into the game the motion was fluid, the audio clear and I began to forget I was on a chromebook.  I have an Alienware 15r2 at home, comparing the two I was impressed that the chromebook was able to keep up.  Certainly it had lower frame rates, less visual effects and much longer load times, but the game was still good looking, smooth and playable.

I miss the SD card slot and actually I prefer the keyboard on my old model, but the Chromebook 14 is faster, has not hung once, and the display is much nicer (clearer, larger). I played Amazon Videos, worked great. Games, great. MS Word Online and Google Docs, great. The aluminum chassis is nice, not quite as cool as my wife's Macbook Air, but it is 4x the cost. The hinged cover is not as cool as the chassis, and I would prefer not to have the ACER insignia protruding from the top cover. But, hey...

Fit and finish The aluminum case feels quite a bit sturdier and more rigid than our previous Chromebooks having molded plastic cases. There is a slight wire-edge along one side of the lower case of one of the two units we ordered, thankfully not sharp enough to cause cuts, but slightly annoying in normal use.  Beyond that, however, the case is nicely constructed. The hinge appears to be nearly full-length design, a plus over the small hinges used on some laptops. The display is sharp and bright, colors appear reasonably accurate. Native resolution appears to be 1536 x 864. Keyboard is your standard \"chiclet\" type. Features There are two USB3 ports and an HDMI port on the left side. Power and charging LEDs, headphone jack, and charging connection are on the right side. Speakers are downward firing, which means the sound performance is highly influenced by the surface on which the machine is used. The touch-pad is quite large and adequately responsive. There's also a camera and mic located in the top screen bezel. I'd have preferred three USB ports being available, as that would allow for an external wired keyboard and mouse while still leaving a port free for things like a USB-to-Ethernet adapter and/or a USB stick. This is an especially notable lack, when one also notices that there is no SD card slot, thus making the machine's larger 32GB SSD that much more important. The charging connector and charger I found disappointing. The charging connector is tiny and might therefore be quite fragile for such a constantly used item. Coupled (often literally) with that is a large, clunky, right-angle molded connector, separated by only about an inch and a half from a molded-in ferrite choke. In actual use, this means the the charging cord is awkward. Setting the Chromebook down to charge results in the cord's choke often ending up under the machine. The short section of cord from connection to choke often ends up being bent at quite an acute angle, which I suspect may cause premature failure of the cord. The charger has a separate AC cord, which, depending on one's preferences, might be either a pro or a con. I have noticed that the charger gets quite hot under initial charging when the battery is quite low. Performance Most of the items I have noted above are really quite minor, and many are highly dependent on one's use case or preference. The Chromebook performs just fine, start up is typically fast, and I noticed no significant slow-downs when having a fair number of tabs open. This Chromebook supports Android applications, so the range of available Apps is broad. I had occasion to test out my USB-connected Wacom tablet with Adobe's Photoshop Sketch Android app and found it to work very well. The Acer detected and activated the tablet without any input from me required. Overall, I recommend this Chromebook. It's reasonably priced, and pleasant to use. For most people, it should be a more-than-adequate choice."}, {"name": "Sue from the Midwest", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "July 27, 2016", "title": "Good value- except for Bluetooth functionality.

Cool to touch- no uncomfortable heat when you have it in your lap.   Battery- While I don't get near the stated battery life, it charges very quickly. Cons- Screen- Too dark even at the brightest setting. Also, there is a marked difference in how bright the screen is when it is charging vs unplugged   Sound- The speakers aren't loud enough if there is any other noise in the room.   Bluetooth- Technically, this has Bluetooth, but it's not very functional. This is my biggest complaint. I like to have a movie on when I'm  working in the kitchen. It's impossible to hear dialog when the fan is on or the dishwasher is running. When I use the Bluetooth headphones that worked perfectly fine with my Samsung Chromebook, the sound starts to sputter even if I'm standing right next to the computer.   Jack and USB placement- I wish everything was on the left side, or at least on the same side.

It would also save me several hundred dollars relative to a Windows machine or Macbook. I was unsure whether I wanted this Chromebook or the 15\" model with upward-facing speakers, and ended up going with this one largely for aesthetic reasons: the aluminum case is not only lightweight and fanless, it also is attractive and could be confused for a Macbook.  The downward-facing speakers sound good, although as with all down-facing speakers how they sound depends what surface you put it on: on my kitchen counter, loud and clear; on my couch, still clear but much quieter.  This is mostly just fine.  The screen is bright and sharp, the keyboard has a comfortable feel to it, and although I have a wireless mouse, the multi-touch trackpad is effective enough that I don't need to use it.  I also get about 8-10 hours of battery life from my typical use of one tab of YouTube and a dozen tabs of social media, Wikipedia, and miscellaneous websites. The only negative things I have to say: the processor is a bit slow under some loads (although I am willing to put up with this for not having a fan), the power plug feels somewhat loose and fragile, and Chrome apps tend to be somewhat underwhelming compared to their rich client counterparts.  Overall it was worth it for me. 8) Update: After a month, the touchpad has started working only intermittently.  Sometimes it works like normal, sometimes it requires a bigger imprint than the tip of my finger provides, sometimes it does nothing (although a physical press for a left button click always works).  It seems to get worse when it's cold.  Although I'm sure Amazon would make it right if I returned/replaced it, I'm lazier than that, and I'm mostly okay using a wireless mouse on my laptop.

My other current favorite Chromebook is also an Acer, the Acer 15.6\" HD model.

My 2011 was still going strong, but I wanted a bigger screen. If it had been a PC - an 8-year old PC - it would have been replaced years ago. My daughter started her first year at college and wanted a laptop and is not a Mac person (she uses an iPad and an iPhone though) So I tried to find the best value in a small PC. Needless to say I was disappointed when the computer arrived and there was no response for the touchscreen. I scoured the internet for a simple fix and the ones I found involved deleting drivers and messing with the bios - things I have never messed with on my Macs. So I called HP, gave them my serial number and was told it would need to come in for repair. As I received it the day before, I returned it. Thank heaven for Amazon. I have ordered another HP computer, this time a Spectre x360, hoping that since it was a 2in1, they wouldn't forget to assemble it with a touchscreen.

I pored over reviews, technical data, and other analysis but decided on the HP because it was just too much premium and value to disqualify. This particular version is packed with tech that would cost over $2,000 in a similarly equipped Surface Laptop 2, yet I paid just $1000 on Prime Day. Even at $1299 it's a steal, considering you're getting a full 4k display, 512gb SSD and 16gb RAM. The fingerprint reader and backlit keyboard are bonuses, as is the premium build of the hardware. It may not quite edge out the Microsoft fit and finish but it's awfully close. I came from a Yoga 910 which was a gorgeous laptop with similar specs, but I couldn't stand the keyboard. It was prone to missing my keystrokes, and it was loud, with shallow key travel. The Envy's keyboard proved a far better suitor after testing it out at a retail box store, and the rest is history. If you are a writer, appreciate fine design, and want a speedy 8th Gen i7 with more storage and RAM than the average user would ever need, here's your ultrabook. Forget the frills of Bang & Olufsen, which is really just a nicely placed license to evoke an extra premium feel rather than a useful sound upgrade, and enjoy the quality build. Don't expect the fingerprint reader to be 100% accurate (it's not), but appreciate the fact that HP put the front-facing webcam where it's supposed to be and deal with the above-average battery life that underdelivers but still excels. Oh yeah, and grab the two-year accidental damage protection plan which is just $50 through Amazon, rather than paying $200 or more through a retail channel."}, {"name": "Cyrus", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "July 21, 2019", "title": "I wanted to love this laptop.", "review_text": "The features / specs are amazing.  The price is fantastic.  But fatal flaws made me return this unit. Screen - Fantastic colors and brightness.  Of course it's hard to appreciate 4K vs 1080p on a 13.3\" screen, but side-by-side it is definitely noticeable (against other PCs). Power - Quad-core i7 and 16gb of DDR4 ram.  Need I say more?  As fast as a 13\" laptop can be right now.  Only video editing would you notice any real lagging. Sound - I think the B&O speakers are miles ahead of most other laptop speakers, especially 13\" ones.  A+++ here. Quality - Excellent.  A solid device without a doubt - competing with Apple quality. Keyboard - Huge problem here.  The added row of keys on the right side shifts the entire keyboard to the left.  I don't know why other reviews don't harp on this.  It not ergonomic at all, and all your years of muscle memory with a QWERTY keyboard will be wasted.  I used it for a week, did several typing tests, and consistently had problems with this layout.  I wish it was centered like every other computer.  On a small laptop, it is very awkward to place your hands on the left side of the computer. Touchpad - Another huge problem here.  I was coming from a Macbook, which uses a glass touchpad.  This touchpad has a lot of texture, so it is very difficult to make smooth movements on it.  In fact, this ended up being the most annoying problem and the one I could've live with.  Perhaps if you are coming from another PC with a rough touchpad you wouldn't notice. In the end, the specs of this laptop are amazing.  The build quality is phenomenal.  The laptop is beautiful.  But it just wasn't usable for me.  I realize the keyboard and touchpad issues seem small - but these are the most frequently used parts of a computer.  Even being a little off makes the whole computer... off.

If your looking for a laptop that you will be typing a lot on, this is the one to get. For performance, the i7 CPU in this handles everything I throw at it comfortably, and with 16gb of RAM and a dedicated graphics chip, things run very smoothly. I even threw some light photo editing in Lightroom and playing some older games and this did it without issue. The 4k screen is nice, but I'd say that the actual display quality is average. Though the resolution is good, the colors are definitely average and so is the contrast (at least when comparing to my old Retina Macbook). I'm sure to the average user this wouldn't be noticeable. As for the touchscreen, I don't really care for touchscreen computers so I will probably never use that feature. The fingerprint reader is a nice feature, it saves me from having to type in my password on the lockscreen.

I should mention it has a touchscreen. Now, keep in mind that the metal and glass weigh more than plastic.  This 13\u201d computer is heavier than my 15-inch HP.  It also does run warm.  However, the lid, when opened, lifts the bottom of the laptop off of a desk just a bit, which should help.  I can hear the fan, as well, which some people may find annoying.  I don't, as I always have music or TV running. Setup was incredibly fast and easy, with Cortana guiding the way.

Smart. Sleek. Sexy. MAGNIFIQUE!", "review_text": "These are probably the last words that come to mind when thinking of a laptop, but this Ultrabook earns its name and then some in every way, because anyone who sees you using this will be BESIDE themselves, and I mean SICK, with Envy. This thang is FIYAH!!!!!!!!!! Let's start with the unboxing: it arrives in a sleek, black box with a beautiful photo of the laptop on its cover, and when you open it, you are awed by the pristine, silver gleaming contraption inside. When you pick it up and gently unwrap it from its plastic film, you are wowed by how both light and elegant it is in your hands; how something so small can contain your life, and then you can't wait to start filling it up with it. You open the lid and lift the mesh cover protecting the keys; you notice the setup leaflet and take out the power cord, plug her in and turn her on. From there, Cortana takes over, guiding you through the setup! By voice command! Very Jason Bourne. You set up your fingerprint log in, sign in to your accounts and then once everything is registered, off into the wild wild web you go. The first thing you'll notice is how FAST this baby is, the gentle whir of the machine as she takes you off to the farthest reaches of the world if you check out the 4K resolution by looking at the Planet Earth series. It's enough to bring tears to your eyes. You'll be mesmerized by the rhythmic clicking of the keys as you go to your favorite websites and download/install your must-have apps and programs; you will find yourself looking down at the keyboard and smiling as if you've been enchanted by a new lover, and you HAVE! I had been looking for a new computer because I've got this ollllld slooooooooow, 4GB RAM dinosaur of an 15\" laptop that I bought used in a dire emergency because I accidentally cracked the screen on my Toshiba. The \"Gorilla glass\" on this is so beautiful that I don't even want to TOUCH it, even though the touch screen is flawless, like you are on a tablet. The keyboard is perfectly sized and responsive; there is just so much here for me to continue to explore but I am damn near breathless as I write this review because it is simply that exceptional, stunning. I have had some graphic design programs that I wanted to use but was waiting until I got something new so it would have the capacity to rock out, and I can't wait to get started. Where this HAS been incredible for me is Traktor and music programs. No more worrying about lag and staticky mixing because of system overload. This has all the memory and SSD space that you will need, and its ports will more than accommodate any other gadgets you need to connect to it. The sound is exemplary, with the Bang & Olufsen speakers. This is the Ultrabook that every entrepreneur or very lucky student should have; it is the answer and perhaps even a juggernaut to the Macbook. I've certainly learned that just one POWERFUL Ultrabook is WORTH the investment rather than having to replace a tired ass notebook every few years. I prefer large screens so 13 inches has never appealed to me, but this right here has ROCKED. MY. WORLD. I don't wanna go anywhere without it, not even the shower. LOL You have just got to see for yourself."}, {"name": "Bob W", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "May 30, 2019", "title": "Almost perfect", "review_text": "UPDATE: I've been using this laptop for a while now. I've raised my review from four stars to five. It's true, the touchpad is quirky, but I use the computer with a Bluetooth mouse. The reason I've upgraded my review is that even compared to my MacBook Pro, the HP envy stands out. We've recently moved and I spent the last three weeks using this laptop instead of my normal desktop computer. The more I work with it, the happier I am. I've read reviews to complain about the Wi-Fi connectivity. I had absolutely no difficulty. For a while, I was using the personal hotspot on my iPhone. The laptop flawlessly connected and stay connected for days. Speed is incredible! I've been using Photoshop and variance absolutely no delays even when doing complex editing. I admit that I don't use the touchscreen much. I'm just not used to that idea. But when I do, it's accurate and fun. This laptop seems to be HP's attempt at directly competing with the 13 inch MacBook Pro. It certainly looks like one. It's very light; under 3 pounds. It has a powerful four-core Intel processor (Please note that the description of this product says it has a dual core processor. That's not correct mine has a four core.). The screen is great. It has adequate brightness to use in daylight. The colors are vivid and accurate. The touchscreen is every bit as good as any I have ever tried. I have to admit that I usually forget the touchscreen is present; I'm so used to doing everything on a keyboard. However, when I realize I can use my finger, the results are great. This laptop has 16 GB of memory. That's more than enough to run Photoshop and edit large images. I've also run Premier Pro with no problems at all. The combination of the powerful processor and fast, plentiful memory makes this machine perfect for a power user like me. This laptop could easily replace my desktop computer in terms of processing, memory and disk size. My unit has 512 GB of SSD. Considering that most of my data lives in the cloud, I'm never going to run out of disk space. The touchpad is the one weak spot in this nearly-perfect laptop. I find it not nearly as responsive as my Mac's. It's very fussy about where you press it to get a left click or a right-click. The Mac works with just a tap with one finger for left click and two for a right-click. That doesn't happen with the HP. I use a Microsoft mobile mouse to compensate. That brings me to one really great feature of Windows 10. If you go to the Control Panel and then the mouse screen, you'll find that there is an option to disconnect the touchpad when the mouse is present. This is an amazingly important feature. In the past, I've disabled the touchscreen to prevent accidental mouse activity while typing. Then, on occasion I had a problem at startup and needed to use the touchscreen. Of course it didn't work. Now, if I connect my mouse (Bluetooth), the touchpad is disabled. If I want to do something quickly in the car, and there is no mouse, the touchpad works. The keyboard is generously sized and the keys have a nice solid feel. I have one little quibble: in bright light I find it difficult to read the white markings on the silver keys. In a normally lit room the keys are backlit and very easy to read. I've used HP laptops in the past. I think the keyboard in this laptop is a real step forward for them. Priced similarly to the MacBook Pro, I expected a great deal from this laptop. From the perspective of processing power and useful features, this HP competes favorably. If anything, the screen is better. Colors are accurately rendered, brightness is more than adequate, and the touch functionality is a great bonus. Battery life is excellent. I don't have the standard test suite to verify the manufacturers claim of about eight hours of working on a charge. I can say that I had absolutely no problem getting through the day without needing to recharge. Of course, battery life is dependent on how you are using the laptop. For example, when I worked with it in my car I had to crank up screen brightness which of course, eats up battery. Even so, I never ran out of power. Wi-Fi operation is flawless. The built-in camera and microphone provide excellent quality for videoconferencing and other AV needs. I like that there is a physical switch to turn off the internal camera. That certainly improved my comfort using the device in my hotel room. If HP could fix their quirky touchpad, this could be a true MacBook killer. Even with the less-than-perfect touchpad, it's a joy working with this computer."}, {"name": "Dave", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "June 3, 2019", "title": "Excellent thin-and-light laptop", "review_text": "To start with, I think thin-and-light laptops are not for everyone.  If your laptop rarely leaves your house, then don't get a thin-and-light.  It's not worth the compromises and the additional cost.  On the other hand, if you travel a lot, a good lightweight laptop is often a good choice. The first thing to like about this laptop is the CPU: the i7-8565U is a four-core, 8 thread design with a base 1.8 GHz base clock, a turbo clock of 4.6 GHz (!), and an 8 MB on-die cache.  All that with a 15-watt typical power dissipation.  This is a \"Whiskey Lake\" class CPU which means includes mitigations for a lot of the latest security vulnerabilities such as Meltdown.  This is a great choice - you have a lot of headroom in this CPU to take on whatever you are going to throw at it (outside of high-end 3D gaming). Speakin of gaming, while this does come with a NVIDIA GeForce MX250 GPU, don't plan on getting too crazy with the 3D gaming.  You can, in theory, play some of the newest games at lower settings, but to get any decent frame rates you will need to mostly stick to games that came out in 2016 or earlier.  Now that's a very general statement and not true in all cases, but if gaming is important to you, this may not be your laptop.  On the other hand, is a lot more graphics than you typically get out of a thin-and-light laptop, so from my perspective, it's nice that I can do any gaming at all. If there is one mantra I have for buying a laptop is you MUST get a solid state HDD.  Magnetic drives just can't handle the abuse laptops take.  This comes with a very nice 512 GB SSD, and it's an M.2 drive which means it's crazy fast.  The 16 GB DDR4-2400 SDRAM is fast, though a little power hungry.  The CPU supports LPDDR3-2133 and I think that would have made more sense with just a small performance hit. The screen is fantastic.  The resolution is almost overkill for a screen this size, but I'll take it.  I also like that it's Corning Gorilla Glass.  This is much stronger than traditional glass screens - and we can thank the popularity of this glass in smartphones for bringing the price down low enough to use on laptops. My main con for this laptop is a lack of an ethernet or HDMI port.  Thin-and-light laptops are usually too thin for these ports.  That means you need to get a USB 3.1 Type C adapter for any extra ports you need.  You can either get a dedicated HDMI or ethernet adapter or get a multi-adapter.  If you are traveling for business get all the above, you never know when you are going to need them and they take over very little space in your bag. Overall this is a well-rounded laptop that's great for anyone who needs performance and mobility.  The build quality is excellent, and the HP Envy line has a good reliability record (far better than their Pavillion line).  If mobility isn't important, then there are better choices, but for a student or business traveler, this is a great choice for a reasonable price."}, {"name": "Todd Ellner", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "May 27, 2019", "title": "An excellent small-form laptop", "review_text": "When the newer, thinner Macs came out I joked that Apple had created the new iMan. He has only one orifice which is also his only sensory organ, but man is he SKINNY! I've finally bitten the bullet and gotten the HP equivalent. I have to say I'm very, very happy. The machine is solidly built with a metal case that gives it a little more weight and a lot more ruggedness. The keyboard and touchpad are adequate, but with a docking station or hub that isn't a concern. My current setup is two monitors (one of them 4K), keyboard, mouse, printer, ethernet, and a USB device charging through the charging port. It performed flawlessly. Screen resolution is fantastic. The touchscreen mode works seamlessly, although it would be nice if the screen could fold back or rotate so it could be used more like a tablet. Oh, well, that's a very minor quibble. Sound quality is much higher than you'd expect for laptop speakers. The fingerprint sensor took a while to calibrate but works very well. I was able to get it to recognize my fingerprint, switched to my wife's and switched back. All that is what you would expect. I needed to do a couple things which put the machine through its paces - running through Atlassian's Here Be Dragons which has several services running simultaneously along with a database server and Tomcat. That's a bit of a load for most machines. The Envy handled it all with aplomb and without grinding to a halt, something which I have had happen with other laptops. Afterwards I played an FPS game and did some JAVA development with IntelliJ and TeamCity which can be pretty heavyweight. Again, no problems. I'm very, very happy with this machine. It's an excellent replacement for my old laptop. And boy, is it skinny."}, {"name": "evanjamesroskos", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "June 18, 2019", "title": "Touchscreen functions are limited but the machine itself is superb", "review_text": "I've long been one of those \"do we really need touchscreens on everything\" people. In fact, I reviewed the 27\" HP Envy All-in-One desktop many years ago and lamented the limited touchscreen functionality. Touchscreen on phones and tablets work well if the software offers lots of different touchscreen functions, but this HP seems to limit the screen to single-digit usage, even while the touchpad allows for 1-4 finger gestures that can be assigned by the user. On the one hand, that's sad and limiting and on the other I'm not sure how much I miss it. Being able to zoom, rotate, flip, resize, and such when editing photos would be cool. SCREEN I wasn't sure if a 4k 13inch screen was really necessary but it's magical: crisp and bright! (Don't read this the wrong way; I just still have questions about whether 4k density in such a small screen means much. After using this machine, I think it DOES make a difference! I could see a difference between this machine and a 1080p 13\" screen. The touch response of the screen is fine -- but it's limited to pretty much single digit use. The touchPAD on the laptop can handle all sorts of 1-4 finger gestures. Somehow this is not translated to the screen. STORAGE It's 2019, so SSD storage is standard on this machine. You will appreciate this when you're installing new software and if you work with photos and videos. Video games don't always benefit from SSD storage (except in cases where long load or save times are an issue; but even then, no guarantees in my experience with various systems). WIndows loads up and restats FAST because of the SSD. It's glorious if you remember the days even 10, 15, or 25 years ago when you could reboot and go to get a snack. Windows has definitely improved, but the SSD drive makes a huge difference. If you end up with a USB3 back up device plugged into this, doing a full-drive backup will not take all night like in the old days. Transfer speed is great and makes backing things up less of a \"I'll do it some other time\" feeling. KEYBOARD Laptops or \"portable computers\" as they are legally called, tend to have underwhelming keypads. The HP is not awful but it's not the kind of machine I would want to type on for hours at a time. I would have to get used to the wide, flat, square keys. Though they are backlit, which is nice, and they respond well. I've used plenty that are bad. This machine is just \"eh\". Note that I spend much of my computer time on a desktop with a mechanical keyboard because I type A LOT. For short documents, the keyboard is fine. But expect fatigue if you are trying to type reports, essays, articles, or a novel. The keyboard does include plenty of useful functions though: airplane mode, volume, media controls and even the Home/PgUp/PgDn/End buttons that could've been cut from the design. I find that the less than pleasing tactile nature of the keys is made up for by the plethora of functions that are still included. TOUCHPAD The touchpad is accurate and offers plenty of gestures, which can be reprogrammed for personal use. PORTS 2 USB ports -- one on each side of the machine -- are offered. There's also a USB-C and SD card slot. The USB3 ports are modified so that they have a slight hinge -- I guess to keep the sleek lines of the laptop. Basically you have to use the USB connector to open the port slightly so that you can insert it. This sounds way more annoying than it is, but it was my first exposure to such a mechanical feature. SOUND The HP Envy sports a Bang & Olufsen sound system. I will say that the speakers are good and there's an equalizer accessible via pre-installed software. As with all things sound related, you will have to fuss with Windows to ensure that the B&O equalizer is the one running the show. The speakers are good and will let you hear things well even outside, so enjoy a movie in the park, if you wish! GRAPHICS CARD The Envy has integrated graphics in the Intel chip as well as a NVIDIA GEFORCE card. I installed a couple of games that I knew would require some effort from the graphics and wasn't super impressed. Cities:Skylines stuttered at the top graphics options; even when I used the NVIDIA optimized selections, the game didn't run fast,  though the stuttering did go away with some tinkering. Like most machines, everyone's mileage will vary because of the type of game, but I didn't see anything here that was surprising. It's still better than an MacBook graphics card when it comes to gaming, but I think this machine -- with it's SSD and 16GB of Ram -- is meant for multitasking not necessarily gaming. So get some work done! DESIGN HP has designed a pretty, silver, metallic, thin, lightweight machine. I would say that the chiclet keys probably won't stop crumbs and liquids very well and the speaker grill likely will need a nice brushing now and again. A cool thing is that there's a built in foot that ensures the base of the computer isn't flat on the desk surface, allowing for air to circulate. This didn't stop the fans from running, but with a i7 chip, getting rid of heat is always helpful. OVERALL I received this unit for free to review. I have 2 Windows PC desktops, one I built myself, the other is an HP Envy from years ago that is still running well. I've also used Mac portables extensively, so when I used this machine it was hard to judge it in a vaccuum. There are plenty of things I like about it and if I were replacing an older laptop, the price and functionality wouldn't cause me to hesitate. I don't think I could get a cheaper laptop that's brand new with this much RAM and an SSD and a beautiful screen. The touchscreen aspect I could do without, but for MS Office or similar document creation, this machine works great and would likely hold up for a few years if treated right (ie, protect against malware and don't drop it!)"}, {"name": "Amazon Customer", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "May 23, 2019", "title": "Excellent well built laptop", "review_text": "I have been searching for a new laptop to replace my 9 year old macbook, unhappy with the cheap quality of both apple and PC products lately.

The fingerprint scanner is an added bonus to login, and the touch screen works amazingly well. The included i7 and SSD are extremely fast, and the display looks incredible. The contrast ratio and blacks really make the display pop. It's a pleasure to stream movies on it. Even working on adobe, editing videos, playing music in the background, and keeping Internet application open didn't slow it down. The only con in my opinion is that the laptop stays a little warm.

I watched a number of the 2019 women\u2019s World Cup games on this. The screen was crisp and vivid and the speakers were standout great for a laptop.  They were loud enough that many times I found I was not at max volume... for me and the many laptops I\u2019ve owned, this is almost unheard of.

The usb full size ports, in order to work on such a thin laptop have a little metal flap that pushes down when inserting a usb cable or device.

So, HP made it so that you had to pull down an insert in front of the USB port to be able to plug your USB device into the computer.  This works, but it means that you need two hands to plug a USB device into the computer.  Of course, you always try to insert the USB plug upside down first and so the process takes longer than it should.  But, it is a compromise to get a thin computer. Pros - Nice screen (4K!).  UHD videos look amazing.  The 13\u201d screen is much smaller than my 15\u201d Samsung laptop, but the 4K and MX250 graphics card make up for the difference, in my opinion. - Comes with some preinstalled applications from HP, but not a lot of bloatware overall.

Like the thing with the USB ports, there isn\u2019t enough room for the screen to be able to swivel, so it becomes a point on which the computer rests when it is open.  I have uploaded a photo with this review to show this. - The speakers sound tinny.  Trying to use the equalizer through the Bang & Olufson application did improve things, but then the music sounded artificial.  Headphones are a must if you actually want to listen to music. - RAM is already maxed out at 16GB Overall, this is a fantastic 13\u201d laptop if you wanted something small, yet powerful enough to do most jobs.  I use the HP Envy 13\u201d for travel since it doesn\u2019t weigh down my carryon, fits is small spaces (think tray table) and had an amazing display.  My only significant gripe goes back to the keyboard which really could have been done better, perhaps with indented keys."}, {"name": "MyPenName", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "July 18, 2019", "title": "Excellent laptop", "review_text": "Simply put, this little laptop is a mini workhorse. Dont let the size and sleek look fool you. It can handle multiple tasks and programs at once, without getting bogged down. The size is perfect. Not too small to be able to do some actual work on, and not a huge full size laptop to lug around. It's the perfect compromise on size, but doesnt lack any of the power of a full size laptop. Keyboard is nice. Keys feel good when typing. Not too clacky. Fast, fluid typing without any skips. Large trackpad area works very smoothly. Battery life is excellent. Charging to full battery doesnt take any longer than my phone does. Going in and disabling some background apps helps extend the battery even more. Screen is beautiful. You can adjust the nightlight setting to reduce blue light and have it automatically go into effect at a certain time and revert back to normal at a certain time. I had never used this on any of my other laptops or computers, but I'm finding I actually like it a lot. It does make a difference in your sleep and ability to relax at night to get to sleep and it is also a lot easier on my eyes and reduces eye fatigue. Sometimes you hear about things like this and you think eh that's not really an issue.. but then you try the alternative and realize it's actually something to think about and see the benefits. So, maybe it's not important to some/most people, but I figured I'd mention it anyway since I found it interesting and useful. Screen calibration (within Windows) for HDR videos. Although mine was fine as is. Touchscreen  works without any issues. Sound is good. Especially for a laptop. Body/housing feels durable. It doesnt feel like its delicate or you have to be super careful with it, despite being the pretty little thing that it is. Its metal, but still lightweight. Feels secure at the hinges. This beauty is worth the investment.

I DARE you to tell me i'm wrong. I have an Acer aspire E15 and an acer aspire 5 (5504) and the fan noise combined from those two laptops are less than 1/8th the loudness of this new laptop. IT IS TERRIBLE. Think you can live with that? There's more: If you're a long time user of acer products you've become used to the 2nd function keys being assigned between the F3 to F9 keys and in blue. Thats GONE with this laptop. Here's the new configuration. F1 (previously f4) is the sleep function key, F2 (previously unassigned) is now airplane mode/wifi disable key, F3 and F4 (previously wifi and sleep respectively) are to adjust screen brightness, F8 (previously mute function key) has switched places with F9 now serving the keyboard backlight on/off function, F9 (previously keyboard backlighting function) is actually the mute function key. F10 and F11 (previously unassigned) are now the volume down and up function keys respectively. Just to add some additional frustration to the mix none of these keys are the second function anymore. So if you're used to hitting F5 to refresh browser windows or F3 to search now you'll need to hit the Fn Key first as the media functions take precedence in this new keyboard layout. This can actually be changed by rebooting and pressing F2 to enter the bios settings before windows loads. Even if you change the F1 - F12 keys back to their original hierarchic order the arrow keys are no longer the keys to access brightness or volume control but instead are music media keys. Good luck with that confusion. This new laptop basically is an all out attack on keyboard shortcut users even the Home key is now a point of frustration since they removed the dedicated home key and you're only left with the numlock access only home key that shares functionality with the number 7 key on the keypad. I also had to finish install necessary driver level software like the \"acer quick access application\" because as this was not installed there was no way to know if num lock or capslock was engaged as there is no LED indicating the status of these keys. Even if you Update the bios to the latest firmware version like I did it still won't solve the problem of the USB 3.0 ports having slower read/write speeds than a typical USB 2.0 port. Anyway At least THANK GOD on the plus side as a result of all that fan noise you do get ample cooling so the laptop does stay nice and cool..... HAHAHHAHAHAHAH PSYCH NOOOOOOOOOOOO no such luck my friend this laptop gets VERYYYYYY HOTTTTT in your lap and it is just pathetic that for all the fan noise you have to deal with it can't even keep the laptop at a comfortable temp while sitting there idle without a single thing going on. The charger is also not the regular acer charger so if you have other acer laptops that can share chargers interchangeably this one will not work with them.  BTW this is all within the first half hr of use. Imagine what I'll discover by this time tomorrow. Seriously guys and gals if you're a long time acer product user and you've become accustomed to any level of consistency across their products just forget it with this laptop. I currently use the A515-51G-5504 aspire 5 for productivity and while you may think that the only difference between the two is that one has a dedicated graphics card and the other does not TRUST ME those two laptops are like NIGHT AND DAY different when it comes to speed, noise levels, and general build quality. I cannot overemphasize how much you should AVOID buying this laptop. You are going to HATE IT!"}, {"name": "Dave and Kym", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "July 13, 2019", "title": "Exceeded expectations almost everywhere.", "review_text": "Bought this unit as a budget replacement for my fairly high-powered Dell desktop which was lost during flooding. I wasn't expecting much from a $500 laptop but just needed something to get me reconnected. Setup was a breeze, setting it to my preferences was simple, removing the (modest) bloatware from Acer was easy and I was pleasantly surprised at the quickness of the unit. The memory and drive appear to be easily and inexpensively upgradeable but it functions flawlessly right out of the box. I wasn't paying for or expecting gaming-quality graphics but the display renders internet and video perfectly. Those that find fault with this unit must be comparing it to others costing 2 to 3 times as much. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking a laptop to take care of their basic computing needs. Very nice product for the money. Well done, Acer. Update from 10 days later:  Been using it relentlessly and comparing it to my desktop, which had far more memory, storage and graphics capabilities, and I am honestly thrilled. I was thinking of using this as a bridge-unit until I could go back to a new desktop but am seriously rethinking that. The thing that really impresses me is the boot-time. This guy goes from powered down to browsing in about 30 seconds. Not sure if that's just the SSD or newer CPU but I am loving it. Pretty sure I'm going to start using this as my main and adding a docking station, keyboard/mouse (of course), monitor, a bit more memory and storage, and just rolling with it. Disclaimer: I am not a gamer and I understand this machine won't do complex graphics. Update 2: Just to see if it would work, I installed a $65 16GB memory card to bring the total RAM to 20GB, the maximum Acer allows for the unit (it comes with 8GB but you have to remove a 4GB card to upgrade). It worked flawlessly and it is now far zippy-er than my Dell. From what I've read, the extra memory allows it to run cooler and hopefully adds to its service life. Update 3 (I promise this is the last). Thrilled with this little budget-monkey. Restart time, 25-30 seconds. Startup from shut down (not sleep), 12-15 seconds including pin-entry time. Kicking it up to 20GB memory really helped. For anyone that wants to try this stunt (and possibly void the warranty) all it takes is a plastic spudger (google it) and a small Phillips head screwdriver to take the back of the laptop off. 16GB memory cards are readily available from Crucial and Memorystock, usually on Amazon. The video that gave me confidence to try it was on YouTube but it showed how to add a hard drive, not a memory card. Older Acers had a removable panel over the memory but on the  Acer Aspire 5 A515-54-51DJ, you have to take off the whole back. Don't even try it if you are confused about which end of a screwdriver to use or never read instructions. A final note about some of the drama-queen reviewers that complained that \"it gets so hot\" or \"the fan sounds like a 747 taking off\": Just because it's called a laptop doesn't mean you should use it on your lap covered with your fleece blanket blocking the air vents. Use mine on my desk and on the rare occasions that the fan kicks on under heavy use it makes a gentle whirring sound, barely noticeable. If it died tomorrow, I'd buy another. Loving it Update 4 (OK, I lied).  After upgrading the memory and performing every performance-enhancing trick I could find on the internet with Windows, apps, settings and everything else, I started testing my budget computer. The most comprehensive free test I found was from UserBenchMark and I was kinda proud of the results. The test results can vary depending on the state of the computer but here was my best test (the others were pretty close): \"Overall this PC is performing way above expectations (95th percentile). This means that out of 100 PCs with exactly the same components, 5 performed better. The overall PC percentile is the average of each of its individual components. This PC is likely operated by a technical master!\" Did you hear that? I'm a technical master!  All kidding aside, this $500 budget unit is working so far above my previous desktop that I'll never go back (sorry, Dell). I read that the average laptop only lasts 3-5 years before needing replacement. I'm OK with that and my next unit is definitely going to be a graphics-improved version of this machine, hopefully Acer.

Super fast", "review_text": "I bough this Acer a few days ago to replace a Toshiba Satellite C55-C5241 that suddenly died (monitor stopped working) 3 short years after buying it. I was originally reluctant to buy an Acer as I was not very sure about the quality, was concerned about another review that mentioned the fan was very loud, and was not sure I could live with a SSD of 256 only. Here are my initial impressions: 1 Speed. It is a JOY to power up this computer. In fact, I shut it down and then back up just to enjoy how fast it is to power up. I was always amazed by how the Chromebook my son gets from his middle school was so much faster than my Satellite (or even the HP I have at work) was to power up. I guess it all pretty much boiled down to the SSD vs. the HDD hard drive. If you are debating whether it makes a difference, I can grantee you it makes a world of difference. This computer is up and running in seconds. I used to DREAD doing anything in my 3 year old Satellite. No more. It is also very fast to write to the SSD if you are downloading large files. Fast fast fast. 2 Storage. I have a ton of pictures and videos and they won't all fit in this 256GB SSD, but is it VERY easy to solve that. This computer comes with an HDD harness and cable to add an internal HDD (max width is 7mm) and there are Acer videos on  how to do it. I almost did it in about 15 minutes, but was unsuccessful only because I tried to use the 1TB HDD from my Satellite not realizing the width was 9.5mm until I tried to close the case back up. You can buy a compatible 1TB HDD for about $50. You can also add an external HDD of 2TB in capacity for about $60. With either of these solutions you get a really fast computer with enough storage. 3 Current Generation Processor (Intel Core 5 8th generation). You can check the benchmarks on how fast it is. For my General Family Laptop purposes it fits the bill just fine. 4 Build quality. This laptop feels very sold and I love the lighten keys that the Satellite did not have. 5 Really good overall value. I paid about $500 for this laptop, and if you factor an extra $50 to $60 for extra storage you are at a sub $600 setup with newest (as of July 2019) Intel Core 5, 256GB SSD, great build quality, good monitor, etc. I think it is a great deal.

Setup is very simple, even with the minimal amount of manuals and documentation you find in the box. It's very literally a plug and play experience. Specs: 256GB SSD (excellent) 3.9Ghz i5 (you can do better, but might have to go up in price range) 8GB DDR4 RAM (not bad, you can do better) Windows 10 (excellent, albeit with ads) 4 total USB Ports (Excellent) The computer is fast on startup, no doubt because of the SSD and the good i5 chipset that comes with this model.  When multiple apps are running, it can experience slowdown, but typically this has only happened with me while I'm running very intense programs - playing or converting media while surfing the web and typing something.  Again, this is something that I doubt most users of the device will notice, but if you are a power user, it makes sense to upgrade from this model. The other thing to call out is the speakers - they are outstanding.  Loud, clear sound, and easy controls make this a standout feature that most laptops don't have. The only major downside for me is that there is only the 256GB SSD, without any traditional hard drive for data storage.  It's not that there are not options, from cloud storage to removable drives, but it is kind of an inconvenience for those who have large data libraries they'd like to access on the go.  The device does come with a kit to upgrade the drive kit, but few users, myself included, will likely crack this open and give it a go. Overall, this is a classy piece of equipment that belies it's low price, and that makes it a great buy in my opinion.  You wouldn't think from taking a look at the construction or the general performance that this is a budget priced laptop.  It won't be for PC gamers, although a few older games will run fine on the device, and power users will notice occasional slowdowns, but you'd likely know that as soon as you see that this model is on the low end of the ACER spectrum.

Got the Laptop swiftly like Amazon knows to deliver and opened up the box. So here are my impressions after 3 days of use (I will update my review after several weeks): Build quality&design: Acer design is pleasant, Business oriented but somewhat dull. The build seems ok, sturdy enough for general use but I would be careful not to drop the thing. the size is significantly bigger then my 14inch dell, so consider buying a protection sleeve for it, But for a 15.6inch laptop it's pretty light, so good for travel. Screen: The IPS screens delivers nice display, nice colors and sharpness. the brightness is more then enough for using during daytime, but not in direct sunlight or very sun lit rooms. The bezels are thin, but the screen is warping if you move it with your hands. All in all a nice HD display, nothing fancy. Touch&keyboard The touch pad is in a good size, ok accuracy but not needle precision. The multi fingers gestures works great. The keyboard is Chiclets style, has nice feedback and feel. But... NO indicator for CapsLock NO indicator for NumLock NO indicator for touchpad lock And the Home, End, PG Up, PG Down are on the NumPad so If you use them, it will be annoying to turn the NumLock off every time. The Backlight keyboard is great, But... It turns off automatically after 8 seconds and you can't change this setting. Why? only Acer knows the answer for that. Also, when you plugin the Laptop to the electric cable, the Small and almost invisible little blue led charging light indicator is located on the right side (the opposite side from the plug hole) and there is NO on screen indicator for it. What?! this is plain stupid. The wrist space on the keyboard is very convenient. Performance: Well, in this area no complaints so far. I5 8th gen is speedy and responsive. the Nvme drive is great and the 8G ram is enough for general use. All in All I gave it 4 stars, because for 500$ or so, it's pretty good deal, but the small and annoying things made it go down in rating.

What's \"special\" about this thing is all you get for an \"entry level\" price of $500 or so. Big, bright, full UHD screen.  Quad-core, 8th Gen Intel Core I5 CPU.  Decent size SSD (easily upgradeable to 1TB if you want/need), and comes with an extra SSD caddy, connector and spare screws to add a second storage drive.  High speed CPU/SSD/motherboard bus/interface (PCIe/NVMe).  Biometric security/ID options.  Nicely backlit keypad.  Decent number of input options.  The build is a little on the flimsy/plasticky side (only the top shell is aluminum, which is exactly where you want it BTW \u2026 to protect the most costly single part in the whole appliance:  the screen), but heck, that's \"entry level\" ... my laptop is at my workstation/desk most of the time, so that's no problem for me.  All my prior, trusty Toshiba Satellites had no aluminum on the outer case at all. This thing is sleek, lightweight, fast and very easy to set up/use.  Acer has taken all the most attractive advances in laptop tech from the past 5-10 years and figured out a way to streamline and squeeze them into a really nice entry level machine at a VERY competitive price.  The only thing I might grouse about on this laptop is the bare minimum 8GB RAM they put in it (the removable/replaceable part is only 4GB), but that can be upgraded to 20GB for around $60 if you need it. I've been using laptops as my primary work station for more than 20 years now, and every time I replace one, I marvel at how far they've come by the time I upgrade.  No exception to that rule here ... couldn't be happier with what I got for the buck in this one.  Only time will tell how it holds up.  Thanks Acer ... nice work, and thanks to Amazon and \"Prime Day\" for making my choice/purchase even easier. [P.S. to original review:  I had an unused spare HDD that I bought for my previous laptop a long time ago before converting it to SSD, and thought I might as well use it for extra storage space in this laptop.  It installed/worked fine with the caddy, connector and screws supplied by Acer, but I found that once I'd put the HDD in, the bottom cover was noticeably bulged over the HDD, and the edge closest to it wouldn't fully seat/seal, in turn, making the rest points on the bottom uneven/wobbly.  In short, Acer's case design is a little too thin for proper fit of an HDD in the internal secondary drive bay.  I ended up getting a new 2.5\" SSD which fit just fine in the secondary bay, but I SHOULD also be able to put an HDD in there and can't, that is, if I don't want a bulge and uneven/wobbly rest points on the bottom of my new laptop.  But, since re-purposing of my old HDD was an afterthought with no bearing on my original purchase decision, and everyone knows that laptop HDDs are rapidly going the way of the dodo anyway, this issue falls into the category of, e.g., \"minor annoyance.\"]"}, {"name": "Alex", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "July 17, 2019", "title": "Not really worth the money!", "review_text": "The laptop heats up really fast and the fan inside it is kinda loud Update: Ive had for almost a month now the battery life just gets worse i cant even do paper work or do homework for 2 hours till it needs charging.

Some very high end, some low end. I'm currently moving and needed a laptop for motels/hotels that could allow me to work easily but not spend a lot for something I'll likely wind up giving to my kids after I'm done. This laptop's i5 processor is zippy compared to other i5s I've had. Having SSD out of the box combined with that makes a lot almost instant. I'm used to coding on linux without the overhead of Windows based IDEs but even Microsoft Visual Studio on here is decently fast. Some people have complained about the backlight on the keyboard going out after 30 seconds or whatever (I haven't timed it.) Do you want your battery dying fast? I don't. Really it's as simple as pressing any button for it to turn back on. In the very bottom-left is the control (ctrl) key which I just tap first so I'm not accidentally entering a wrong letter or such and boom the backlight is back on and stays on as you type. Another reviewer said it's not suitable for the dark but fact is that if their backlight was staying off they couldn't be typing much. On the note of the keyboard, it's really nice having a separate number pad on the laptop. A lot are missing this nowadays. Another reviewer complained about the F1-F12 keys defaulting to their functions instead of F buttons and having to use the Fn key. Well, just keep tapping F2 RIGHT after you hit the power button and before Windows loads to enter the BIOS settings. You can switch it to default to F1-F12 and hold the Fn key for the functions instead. Memory is 8GB upgradable to 20GB. I haven't bothered yet. I powerhouse on my desktops but haven't needed more on here yet. Even while running visual studio and installing multiple programs while using chrome and firefox I barely surpassed 4GB. Truth is I've never needed more than 8GB unless I was gaming even though the other computers have a minimum of 16. People are nitpicking at this laptop. It's a 500 dollar laptop. If you need more power/etc for your money, buy a desktop but then you also have to pay for a monitor or get a computer with a monitor in exchange for lower specs. I've been building computers and programming for 20 years now as well as gaming. I give this a thumbs up. Just don't expect to play any fancy games on it but truth is even the intel graphics has 4GB of GPU memory which is plenty for a lot of games combined with it's speed unless for some reason you need super high def graphics. Someone else mentioned RS3 on here. I've played it on lower computers. It's one of the benchmarks I use. I only play it with my wife for something to do together so haven't tested it on here as of now but it should definitely run without an issue. Also the WIFI chip/card (haven't looked) gets faster speeds than my tablet or phone. I'm using a mobile hotspot which is speed limited and get at least 4mbps on it which about maxes it. I'd safely assume normal WIFI would be much faster. I haven't heard the fan once even compiling a lot of code but I keep it on flat and hard surfaces. This is another complaint people have brought up... Know what you're buying when you buy. The vent is on the bottom as with other laptops I've purchased. Just don't block it and you won't have a problem. It's a fairly big vent area compared to having one on the side which actually is beneficial to cooling if you don't block it."}, {"name": "Dan G", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "June 29, 2019", "title": "no regrets here at all", "review_text": "Crypto charting, school work, browsing, etc. Came pre loaded with Cortana, initial setup [from unboxing to browsing the web] via voice command took about 5 minutes.

This laptop has a midrange i5 Whiskey Lake processor with in-built Intel graphics. While this laptop isn't good for gaming at all, the screen is absolutely stunning. However, since the screen is so big, battery life is its biggest compromise. While Chromebooks offer 6-10 hours of battery life, you're lucky to get 5 hours on moderate use with this laptop. So keep that in mind when thinking about purchasing this laptop. This laptop has a fast solid state drive. I clocked 1.5 GB/s and 1.7 GB/s read speeds, so you will have no problems running apps. However, I will warn you that this laptop comes with bloatware. In that case, you can use Windows built-in start from fresh tool in Windows Defender to get rid of that. Overall, this laptop should be decent enough for apps, editing videos, etc. Just beware the battery life. Also, you may want to update the BIOS. You can do that on Acer's support page where you can find the drivers and BIOS to update. This may solve some fan issues. Also, for Linux users, Ubuntu 19.04 is the distribution that seems to work with this laptop. You'll have to switch off secure boot and turn on ACHI. Beware: If you do this, Windows will be wiped and you'll have to install it again. If you try to use Manjaro or any Ubuntu distro before 19.04, you will either get no WiFi or a touchpad that does not work.

There is no option to make it stay on.  This laptop is not suitable for anyone who needs to use it in a dark environment. Performance - other than the annoying design decision above, this is a great laptop for its price.  Windows 10 boots in seconds and overall the laptop feels snappy. 1920x1080 Full HD IPS display - the screen has very minimal IPS light bleed so black level is actually quite decent.  But the sRGB coverage is only at 58% (per DisplayCAL calibration) so don't expect pictures to look terrific.  Again think about the price of this laptop and the screen is OK.  If you need a screen with full sRGB (or wide color gamut P3 like newer Macbooks) coverage, you will have to pay much more. Wifi speed is a bit disappointing.  My Mid 2015 Macbook Pro has about twice the download/upload speed.  This is based on the 5GHz band and the AP is an Apple Airport Extreme, so could this be a compatibility issue?  I have Verizon FiOS 1Gbs Internet connectivity. Connectivity - great onboard connectivity options with 2 x USB 3.1, 1 x USB-C, 1 x USB 2.0, 1 x HDMI, 1 x Ethernet.  I can only get the onboard HDMI 2.0 port to reach 4K@30Hz not 60Hz.  This is tested with an LG 55\" E7 OLED and a 49SM8600PUA Nano 8 Series 49\" TV.  Enabling/Disabling HDMI Deep Color option on the TV makes no difference.  Changing HDMI input to PC mode on the TVs also makes no difference. Battery Life - I can't comment on the battery life as I tend to plug in the AC adaptor.  I would leave the battery at 80% or lower if I know I won't need to use the laptop for a while.

The Aspire 5 easily connects to wifi in any room of the house and on my back deck. I don't keep deep, dark secrets on my laptop so have never before password-protected one but, for those who want such protection, you can choose a PIN or fingerprint (and perhaps both).  I didn't find an option to skip this security feature so chose the fingerprint and have to admit that, if I wanted that protection, it is a fast and secure way of providing it.

The boot-up time is like one second.  I wondered if I left it on overnight, but I didn't.  It's just fast on its own. Occasionally I had problems with the fingerprint reader being a little fussy and made me have to use the PIN until I figured out it works better if I don't swipe my finger and just tap from above.  Deleting and redoing it fixed the problem. I purchased this mainly because I wanted the fingerprint reader and hate passwords.  I am very security conscious, and all new computers should be required to have the fingerprint reader otherwise I won't buy them. Less hard drive space is no problem for me since I mostly use external drives and cloud storage.  I do not keep a lot of personal data on the 256GB SSD drive very long for security reasons.  I mostly use this computer for online, paying bills, and some graphics software.  Now I'm starting to use it more for other software because it is a fast computer even for an i5.  I'm looking to order another Acer and stop buying the brand I've been using for years.  Even after installing large graphics programs I still have about half the space left. I highly recommend this laptop if you want something fast.  I have been using an older version of a 3D program (Poser), and when I found out it was running a little too slow, I moved the content files from the hard drive to an external drive with my other extensive content.  Those files that are normally required to live on the hard drive work much better on an external drive with other content.  There was a major improvement with opening files and many of mine are several hundred GB's in size.  If this laptop can handle opening those files there may be some luck with graphic games.  I haven't tried that yet and probably won't since I don't know if it will work putting Steam games on an external drive and those files are large. This Acer laptop came with a bracket for having another drive installed, but I doubt I'll bother.  It said in instructions to have it done professionally.

Two-week update After deleting some of the programs we didn't want on the laptop; and after installing an older copy of Microsoft Home and Student 2007 (for MSWord alone), this machine continues to be a real performer; i.e., it's still quiet, when the fan comes on; if it 's quiet in the room, the fan can be heard if the room--but it's never loud or noisy as some others have reported; it runs cool (we use it on a desk with plenty proper ventilation for dissipating heat), we never feel the laptop getting warm from use. i should have noted in the above prose that we don't game or watch movies on this PC. Also, when we connected Brother HL-L2300D, the computer instantly recognized laser printer and we installed it. For us this continues to be a five-star laptop. Note: We bought a portable CD/DVD drive to load Microsoft Home and Student software. The PC recognized th outboard drive and we loaded the software with no issues along the way. The drive is: Rodzon External CD Drive Type C USB 3.0 Portable CD DVD +/-RW Drive Slim DVD/CD ROM Rewriter Burner Writer Compatible with Laptop Desktop PC Windows Linux OS Apple Mac. 10/29/2019 Update: Two months into this laptop and the performance continues as in the above comments.

Maybe you can watch old movies with this laptop and feel nostalgic because the speakers sounds like they were from the 1940s. 4. My new laptop doesn't have a screen protector on when I opened the box. Is it a return of someone else's or this line of brand new Acer laptops don't have screen protectors when they left the factory?

My issues are that the sound & videos cards seem not to work correctly, and no amount of updating drivers has fixed it. With the volume all the way up, I can just hear it. This is only partly due to the poor placement of the speakers. Something is wrong with the volume. I\u2019m not a computer guru, but I shouldn\u2019t have to be.

My other  complaint is that this takes some special charging cable that is apparently different than every other Acer model made.

I'm a college student and it's alright for the money. The noise from the fan is really noticeable. And it doesn't take to much to mke the fan start giving it's all. The Wifi card on this is a tad slower but it also depends on your connection. What I can say it that battery life is good (6 - 8.5 hours depending on how you use it). And it does run fast, well fast enough for what most college students will need. So pros: - Fast enough for web browsing, emails, papers, and slight coding - Screen is good, nothing crazy but it gets the job done - Build quality is fairly good but I would recommend a good quality sleeve for this - Keyboard feels great and it's also backlit - It's light and thin so it's very portable Cons: - Fan noise is louder than what you might expect - it does run hot but not to the point that it will burn you - Slight slowdown when it comes to more intense task (gaming, rendering photos or video, CAD) Overall it's good enough. I'm a college student so fan noise isn't a real issue since everyone in class has headphones and the fans are really only noticeable to you. It's great for writing essay papers, web browsing. Basically what most college kids need it for. But if you have a bit extra cash to spend go for something different.

This review is based on my impressions after a couple of days with the unit - I may update it later if anything relevant occurs long-term. Testing Methodology: I don't have a lot of sophistocated instruments for measuring the actual brightness, color gamut etc...  In general I stuck to sofware based tests and my somewhat subjective eyeballs. Construction: The top (back of the screen) is metal, as is keyboard and palm-rest area, the screen bezel and bottom are plastic.  This was a pretty good design decision as it keeps the bottom from turning into a hotplate in your lap.  The hinge feels solid and moves very smoothly. Screen: The screen is rated about 300 nits.  Just based on comparisions with others with similar ratings this screen seems like it might actually be a little brighter than it's rated.  It's perfectly visible outside in daylight as long as there isn't direct sunlight on the screen.  The 144hz refresh rate is a really nice feature and allows for some rock-solid motion.  The contrast and color gamut are very effective and pleasing to the eye.  I don't have a tool for measuring the colors so this could just be clever engineering, but nothing here feels like a compromise.  The screen does suffer from uneven backlight blooming so on a completely dark image, there are bright splotches around the margin, but this is pretty typical for an IPS LCD. GPU: The GPU seems to be able to take just about everything I've thrown at it on the most insane settings and I haven't noticed any performance problems.  The Witcher 3 and Darksiders Warmastered Edition look amazing in motion, with the latter running at a V-sync'd 144hz with no problems at all. It pulled a very respectable score of 14,000+ on the Final Fantasy XIV Stormbringer Benchmark with everything turned up to maximum and every optimization turned off. The laptop comes pre-configured with an overclock setting called \"Turbo\" mode which is activated by a button to the upper-left of the keyboard.  You can, of course, create your own overclocking profiles. In order to more efficiently use power, conserve battery, and cut down on fan noise, as with most contemporary gaming laptops, the Predator Helios 300 uses Intel Optimus.  In a nutshell, Intel Optimus switches dynammically between the considerably less powerful and less power-hungry integrated Intel GPU and the GTX-1660ti.  The system will attempt to guess which GPU should be used for a given process, but you can deliberately control this in a couple of different ways.  From the Nvidia Control Panel, you can set the GPU to use for a given application so that whenever that program (i.e. your games) are launched it automatically does so under the Nvidia card.  Alternatively you can tell the system to favor the Nvidia card for everything (not a great idea unless you want to listen to the fan all the time and watch your battery level drop before your  eyes).  And Lastly, there's a context menu item called \"run with graphics processor\" that lets you select which to use by right-clicking on an application before you launch it.  So Optimus is pretty useful for balancing performance, but it somes with a couple of unfortunate tradeoffs.  There is no \"Display\" option in the Nvidia control panel because Optimus dynamically manages those settings, and G-Sync and Fast Sync options are not possible though technically the GPU is capable of using them. Keyboard: The keyboard is, for the most part, great.  The keys are spaced reasonably, slightly convex, quiet and just have a nice feel.  I'm used to pressing harder so my fingers have a tendency to bounce and I wind up typing double letters occasionally, but it's nothing I can't adjust to. (I tried using the Windows \"Filter Keys\" setting to help with this but it's more of an accessiblity option and is too restrictive)  The width of the keyboard allows for the incorporation of a 10-key keypad on the right, however the keys are much narrower than the rest of the keyboard, and the 0 key has been shifted to the center column to accomodate the arrow keys, so it's a bit of compromise.  It's only really annoying when trying to type in a large string of numbers such as when entering a license key. Trackpad: The trackpad is generously large and very sensitive.  There are no mouse buttons, but the bottom of the pad is clickable with the right and left corners representing the right and left mouse buttons. Sound: The laptop comes with a pair of down-firing stereo speakers that are okay for what they are.  They're tinny and can't really get loud enough to overpower the fan noise when playing games.  Noise cancelling or noise isolating headphones are pretty much mandatory for gaming or anything that drives the GPU.  That said, the virtual surround effect is surprisingly convincing. Backlighting: They changed last-year's red backlight to blue, which I think is somewhat more pleasing to the eye, but it's kind of a deal breaker in the use-it-in-bed scenario because the blue light spectrum interferes with your ability to achieve REM sleep.  It's a thing, look it up. Battery: It runs on a 3720mAh battery which is about 25% more capacity than last year's model.  Trying to give a \"it lasts this many hours\" number is kind of pointless in my opinion because it's affected by background processes, screen brightness, what you're doing with it, the age of the battery, etc. Let's be honest though, no one is buying this laptop for its battery life.  Nvidia has several settings which seek to improve battery life while gaming, but they all involve framerate throttling.  If you want to game while not connected to mains power, then you're probably playing games that would work just fine on a laptop with a fraction of the power of this thing. Webcam/Mic The webcam maxes out at 720p30.  That resolution also holds for still images so it seems like that's the geometry of the sensor itself.  It works okay in relatively low light - with the brightness gain cranked all the way up, the glow of the screen is enough to allow it to capture a usable amount of detail in a dark room.  In a normally lit room the image is a bit darker than what you would see with your eyes, and as with most webcams, colors are little washed out.  And like most pinhole cameras, the brighter the lighting the clearer the picture and the more faithful the colors.  This would be perfectly serviceable in a well-lit office, or outdoors.  The stereo microphone picks up voices clean and clear. Network: The \"Killer\" WiFi chip in this machine is amazingly fast.  My Internet service tops off at around 25MB/s, and this Wi-Fi card easily hit 23MB/s (that's bytes, not bits) when downloading games from GOG Galaxy.  I was pleased to see that the laptop also maintains an RJ-45 for wired ethernet connnectivity - it uses a clever hinged port to maximize space while there's nothing plugged in. Hardware Accessibility/Upgrade difficulty: Unlike last year's model, there are no quick access ports - if you want to get at the Wi-Fi, M.2, Memory or SSD area, you have to remove the entire bottom of the shell.  Fortunately everything important is within reach after you take out the 10 philips screws and pull the bottom cover off. Cooling: This is by far the best vented laptop I've ever seen.  The heatsink fins and fans are clearly visible through the myriad slits on the bottom, sides and back.  The fans are as noisy as any laptop I've ever used, but not worse, though when you hit that Turbo button to kick in the overclocking profile and those fans crank up, it sounds like a jet preparing to take off, so if you're doing any moderate to heavy gaming, noise isolating or noise cancelling headphones are not optional. Storage: A 256GB PCIe M.2 drive is installed.  It tops off around 1.5Gbps which is a pretty respectable speed and pretty performmant.  It's not a lot of space though so it's fortunate that there's another M.2 slot to install another card later on.  There's also a bay for a 2.5\" drive, but the bracket and SATA connector kit comes with a warning that Acer no longer considers this a user serviceable operation and implies that your warranty may be voided by attempting to install it yourself. Instructions/Documentation: The documentation for the hardware was honestly a little disappointing.  It gives you a tour of the ports and the keyboard, but doesn't include anything about how to install M.2 devices, upgrade memory or install a 2.5\" drive - these aren't exactly rocket surgery, but it still feels like an oversite that Acer doesn't want to show you what goes where.  The SATA adapter for the 2.5\" drive requires connnection to a proprietary ribbon socket which they altogether fail to tell you how to locate on the motherboard. Other Stuff: I had to chuckle when I saw the \"Turbo\" button.  I'm old enough to remember when that was a thing on the Intel 386 CPUs, and unironically it does pretty much the same sort of thing here. The BIOS is about the most bare-bones affair I've seen recently, with no options for controlling and/or disabling the integrated GPU. The system came with Norton Ultimate installed.  Thankfully that's about the only piece of garbageware installed by Acer.  Microsoft's default \"Windows Defender\" is far superior to Norton and unlike Norton it won't waste a ton of CPU cycles for no good reason.  Windows Defender is already part of Windows 10 - just uninstall Norton and reboot to activate it.  It's better protection and doesn't expire and beg for more money in a year. I've attached an image of the installed applications to this review so you can see what it comes with. Summary: Pros: - Looks and feels sleek and solid - That 144hz screen is fantastic - 300 nits is not MacBook bright, but it's usable in daylight - Comes with fast PCIe M.2 Storage - Wi-Fi is incredibly fast - Powerful GPU - Very effective cooling - I never saw it break 46C Cons: - Blue backlighting is bad for bedtime use - Fans get loud when the system is under a load - No option to disable Optimus and enable GSync (so no GSync) - Norton Ultimate - seriously? Updates: (As I encounter new things that I think are relevant, I'll update the review here) - The USB-C socket is not wired to the video card so it's not possible to output video.  The laptop provides HDMI and a mini-DPort so it's not lacking in output options, but still."}, {"name": "tb", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "June 14, 2019", "title": "Can't beat the price to performance yet.", "review_text": "Laptop performs great. You'll be able to run pretty much any AAA title at Max - Ultra at reasonable frame rates. Cooling much better then the 2018 model and I didn't notice any thermal throttling. You are unable to upgrade the Nvidia driver manually. You must use GeForce experience. 144hrz display is good not great but for the price it's unbeatable. Average backlight bleed which is typicall for IPS. Little to no screen tearing without vsync. No GSYNC which is fine. Speakers better then expected for type of laptop. Fan is loud but not piercing under load. Keyboard is soft but deliberate, great for typing. Very intrusive junkware had to be removed so notifications weren't popping up every 20 minutes, annoying but typical. Laptop is thinner then the more expensive ASUS & MSI competition. The half metal case is confidence inspiring. The bottom is very easy to remove with a few screws and gives you quick access to all replaceable parts  Normally I would not buy an Acer but their Predator line shows quality they have not shown in the past. I'm disappointed it's not RGB like it was advertised on Acers website (cross-referenced specific model #) but for the performance it's not too upsetting. Would recommend as long as the quality lasts as long as it looks good. Edit Make sure your dedicated GPU is enabled and set as default. Optimus is frustrating. But that is Nvidia and Intel's fault. Not Acer's Battery life comments. If you were expecting good battery life out of a laptop you should not be looking at Gaming laptops. There is alot of powerful hardware in this laptop and it gives up battery life for portability. Although I would have given up the 2.5 bay for a bigger battery. Give and take. If you think it's overheating while gaming the components will run fairly hot by default. Even up to 97c . You should really set a fan profile before assuming it's overheating. If it's really was overheating it would shut off automatically. Otherwise it idles at about ,45-55c in a 22c (72f) room. Also set your per game profile. It should not throttle under 80c +- you don't need to use turbo mode. The fan at 40-75 percent works fine in most cases. And is not too loud under 4400 rpm If you think the storage is too small. They placed this laptop in probably the biggest part of the market. You are getting a Hex core processor and a mid-high range GPU and a 144hrz pannel. Until recently you could not get a laptop with this type of hardware for under ,15-1600$. It has 2 m.2 slots and a 2.5 inch bay with provided install hardware.  They saved you money so you can get a plethora of storage options on your own. This is by far one of the simplest laptops to upgrade with 1 pannel. They also sell upgraded ones so you can skip the upgrade If you find that your unit is hitting 90c and above during game sessions and you feel comfortable using throttle stop. most of the temperature is because it turbos to 3.9ghz roughly. dropping the offset for each core will significantly drop your temps. You may lose 1 - 2 frames if you get too aggressive but you can dial it in to your liking. I can game a 70c with turbo at 3.1ghz There will be a small percentage of you with faulty units. Maybe consider an RMA before you trash talk the machine."}, {"name": "Troybuilt", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "June 10, 2019", "title": "This is a nice laptop, and gamer, (1 week review)", "review_text": "I almost cancelled my ordered when realizing the only reviews were all from Vine reviewers! I am glad I didn't. I have only owned 1 other laptop which lasted almost a decade. That and my PC's is what I have to compare it too. When I buy computer stuff I try to get the best for the money that will not be out of date for many years. In my mind I try to buy things that will be good for 8-10 years.   After looking at many laptops from top brands, and reading reviews and articles from the PC world, I realized I wanted a monitor at or above 120HZ. This one is 144HZ amazing! My old laptop became no fun when the cpu was way passed it's prime, so I wanted no less than a I7 8th gen, this one is the 9th gen! When it came to the video I wanted a 1060 or faster. This has the 1660ti, yesterdays beast card. The last on my concerns were heating up while under load. I am still concerned with heating up under load, but at this point it seems to handle everything I have put at it so far. The Predator Key pulls up the CPU, GPU,and Laptop temps, which has not gone much higher than mid 70's. The 2 games my kids and I have played on it might not be the most demanding either at this point.   I like the way the key board feels also, and I use a wireless mouse. I can not say enough about the monitor, it is just great! I have only had the laptop for a week at this point and will update my review if something great or terrible comes to light. Best of Luck! Troy *6 week update* I am very happy with this laptop. It is a daily used PC, and it is fantastic. I'm unable to find any negatives at this time, unless your looking at the 2060+ video cards that have come out this year. so far the 1660ti has been great. I will update again with anything new.

Sure enough, the laptop froze up and despite spending nearly 2 hours with Acer tech support, there was nothing they could do. Oddly enough, after removing 1 RAM module, the laptop fired back up. But, I didn't buy a laptop with only half the RAM. Clearly, Acer needs to address this issue, as if you do your homework (I wish I had), you'll see lots of issues with black screens/unresponsive computers. Would I buy this again? No way.

That's coming from long time AMD guy. It  pains me to say this, but AMD just doesn't exist in the mobile market at  this time. If you need real power in a laptop, Intel and Nvidia are the  only game in town now. I've started traveling more lately so I  needed a laptop that could essentially replace my desktop(s) and this Acer  has far surpassed my expectations in that regard. See attached image.  The construction is solid, and it looks great, in my opinion...sleek  enough to pass as professional with just a hint of \"gaming laptop\" appeal.  The fans can get loud when you're hammering on it, that's true. There is no  free lunch, a laptop must have compromises when they are stuffed with  this kind of hardware. That said, unless you run it in Turbo (read  overclocked) mode all the time I find the fan noise more than reasonable. I  have not found a game, or CPU workload, that required me to use Turbo in  order to have a good experience. It's just stupid fast. In my opinion, you  can't find a better laptop for the money, period.  As you can tell, I love it. Now, I'll answer some of the questions I had  before buying it since there seems to be some confusion. The following  information is from my own experience, if Acer changes things up in the future I can't help you. The is no RGB on this (the 1660ti) version. The keyboard is blue backlit only. For me, this is a pro as I\u2019m tired of red, and I think RGB is a silly overplayed gimmick. If you go to Acer directly, there are different versions with different features. The RAM (16gb total) is 2x8gb sticks of Kingston 2666mhz...it is in dual channel. It scores well in the benchmarks that I have ran and from my own experience 16gb is more than enough for 95% of people out there. It's enough for 100% of the gamers. The included 256gb M.2 style SSD is also from Kingston and seems to perform quite well. There is an additional empty M.2 slot in there. I didn't use it, so I have no idea what will or won\u2019t work in that slot. I decided to use the open 2.5 inch HDD/SSD space for my storage needs. (Please, for all that is sacred, don't you dare put a regular 2.5 HDD in there and hamstring this fine machine). I opted to stay with the Kingston memory theme and stuck a 1tb Kingston 2.5 SSD in there. So, as of this writing I have 186gb free on my C: Drive (it's got all the normal stuff loaded up), and I'm loading my giant Steam library and other big programs onto the 1tb D: Drive. This, in my opinion, is the way to go. The CPU is an Intel last gen refresh (you know 14+++++ lol). That said, it's a good one. 6 cores, 12 threads at 45 watts it tough to beat...actually, I don't think anyone is beating it right now. AMDs mobile Ryzens are topping out at 4 core, 8 threads as of the time of this writing.  I'm sure higher core count CPUs make their way into the laptop market in  the next few years, but for now...this is the best game in town. Also, it's  2019, you don't want a quad core, no matter who makes it. Trust me. The 1660ti is a beastly little thing. Nvidia's naming scheme is clearly insane, but this guy is sweet. It's based on the new Turing architecture and performs quite well. It will smoke a GTX1060 and spit at the heels of a decent desktop Vega 56...and all the while using way less power. For desktops it's a hard card to love, but in a laptop it's brilliant.  The battery is fine for what it is. People wanting 10-hour battery life  and 144 frames per second in their games, pull yourself together people.  Sacrifices must be made for mobility. When on battery the laptop  automatically switches over to the Intel IGP and doing regular (non-taxing)  stuff will get you 4-5 hours. You can force the 1660ti to play ball  while running on the battery through the Nvidia control panel...but I hope  you don't plan on a long gaming session...maybe 1.5 hours. Pro tip: You  want to game? Find a wall outlet.  The \"Killer\" WIFI and internet stuff...actually works. I was getting  stupid fast wireless downloads at distances away from my router that  shocked me. I'm not even going to run an ethernet cable unless I'm playing  a FPS. Blazing fast connection and rock solid so far.  Sadly, you will have to remove Norton (duh) and Windows 10 comes with the  usual fluff that nobody wants...it is what it is. Took me about 30  minutes to remove all the silly stuff and download all the stuff I actually  needed. Keep the Predator App, I think they will be  useful (Update: It is, see below update). When I was setting up this machine, I did log it into my Microsoft  account, and it appears I have Office installed. Not sure if that's because  I have Office on another machine registered to my account...or if this  comes with Office. Your mileage may vary.  The \"Turbo\" button...here's the deal. It only works when plugged in and  above 40% battery. It basically raises the voltage limits of the machine,  while turning on the fans full blast. This results in the CPU auto boosting  on more cores and higher than usual. Oh, and it also overclocks the 1660ti!  Yes, yes you read that right...basically it's an \"overclock button\".  Normally I would laugh at such silliness, but I have to say...it works. It  sounds like a small jet, but it goes like one too. I use it for  benchmarking and playing around...but you could game with it in Turbo,  provided you have headphones. All that said, I'm getting like 62 fps in  AC Odysseus on Very High WITHOUT \"Turbo\". If you're familiar  with this painfully un-optimized AAA title you will understand how  impressive that is, lol. Love that game though...don't judge me.  Hope this helps someone make a big decision. Edit: Update 7/18/19 I read a review where someone was having issues with an echo on the audio. I didn't have this problem as I have an external sound processor that I use. At any rate, I plugged in my headphones directly (1/8th jack) and sure enough...there was an echo. After a bit of investigation, it's from the \"Waves MaxxAudio\" App. This app can be tuned/disabled through the Predator App under the App center portion. Turn that guy off, and your echo goes away. That particular App might be useful in a gaming situation, but if your just watching videos or listening to music it falls a little short. I never thought I would say this, but let Windows control your sound and you will be fine, lol. Edit 9-25-19. Man I love this thing. I travel (airplanes) with it weekly and thus far it has been flawless. Every evening when I get done with work I'm reminded how nice the keyboard on this thing is compared to my company issue Lenovo work laptop. No regrets, I'd still buy it at the current price...very few laptops can compete at this price range. Edit 11-26-19. Still the best at this price point. 1660ti is just the best for laptops balancing performance and battery."}, {"name": "NJBoden", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "June 23, 2019", "title": "An improvement over the last Helios 300 in every way.", "review_text": "After owning the last Helios 300 (GTX 1060) and selling it last year I was ready to be done with the Predator laptops.  The old red laptop was just too big and bulky, and between the thermal issues and instability with the OS I was just done with it altogether.  Then they released this Helios and I'm truly blown away. LOOKS- For starters it is a thinner, sleeker, lighter, and much more visually appealing laptop compared to the big red \"gamer\" aesthetic they were going for with the old model.  While performance matters more than looks to me and while it was a tremendous value for the price, it certainly drew a lot of attention for all the wrong reasons.  This one is a thinner, more modern looking computer with cleaner lines and a smaller profile while still keeping the same screen size.  The blue theme to this is more appealing VS the red and I use it for gaming as well as at work.  My colleagues presume it is a professional laptop but little do they know it is also a gaming powerhouse. PERFORMANCE- The 1660ti is only 7% weaker than my GTX 1070 that is in my PC tower.  It will play pretty much anything at 1080p ultra settings with fantastic frame rates.  Combined with the 144hz screen it is only trumped by my 4K monitor on my actual battlestation at home.  You can look up benchmarks if you're interested, but bottom line here is you'll have no problem with 1080p gaming.  If you want to do 4k you can output to an external monitor.  But that isn't the point of using a laptop. KEYBOARD- It's also an improvement over the previous Helios 300.  It's no mechanical keyboard but it is definitely responsive and comfortable to type on.  The inclusion of a numpad is also a plus SCREEN- Crystal clear with a high refresh rate.  By far the best I've seen on any laptop.  Mine didn't have any screen bleed but I can't speak for everyone.  Good size and the colors are nice and clear. BATTERY- It's simply OK.  You're gonna have better GPU performance with this plugged in but I can see general tasks being done on this for maybe a few hours before it needs to be plugged in. STORAGE- The 256GB drive is an M.2 drive and is crazy fast, but it doesn't hold a lot.  You can add another M.2 drive and there is a bay to add another Hard drive or SSD.  You'll have to actually wire the drive into your motherboard (the old Helios had the port pre-installed) and this is a service that could actually void your warranty.  It isn't the hardest thing to do, but I would definitely recommend taking it to an Acer care center if you can't figure it out. FINAL THOUGHTS- The new Predator Helios 300 is worth every penny.  With improved stability, thermals, looks and performance it is a no brainer.  This thing is gonna be the replacement for my PC tower if and or when it finally kicks the bucket.  If you held off on buying the last Predator due to all the issues you heard about I would say you made the right call.  This is the solution to those problems you were waiting for and then some.   If you're on the fence I can wholeheartedly say (with my name on the line) that this laptop is absolutely worth it.  Yeah it's expensive and I wasn't too thrilled about shelling out for another Predator after all the problems with the first one, but I am glad I got this and I know you'll be too."}, {"name": "Abysal", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "July 3, 2019", "title": "Great gaming laptop, excellent value for the money!", "review_text": "The Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52 laptop with the Intel i7-9750h & nVidia 1660 Ti is a great performer. I've been using it as my daily work laptop with some occasional gaming for about a month. It replaced my Dell e6430. - It runs the latest games at above 60 fps with settings on high (generally speaking), usually much higher. PUBG runs at 95 - 105fps (non turbo), to 110 - 125fps (turbo) - 1080p, high settings. - The screen is excellent, 144hz IPS, and also works really well for Lightroom photo work. There is slight flex on open and close, I wish it was more ridged. It uses a metal lid and features the predator logo that is lit light blue at all times and cannot be turned off. - The keyboard feels decent for a chiclet keyboard, the keys have a positive activation feeling, are quiet, but feel slightly soft on bottom out. The back light can be turned off, but the 30 sec auto off setting cannot be adjusted. This version does not have and RGB back lighting, it's a light blue back light only. The keyboard deck, palm rest, and sides of the laptop are all one metal piece, there is no flex on the keyboard, which is excellent. - The touch pad feels really smooth, but the right/left click button areas require more pressure to activate. - Wireless card is a Killer Wireless 802.11ac i1550 (Intel 9560NGW) - Links at 866Mbps - I've not had any drop-outs or disconnects. Mainly used with Cisco APs and Asus RT3200-AC at home. - Ethernet jack is very difficult to disengage the CAT5 cable from, it seems to snag on the RJ45 connector. Luckily I don't need to use wired ethernet too often. - The web cam and mic combo are pretty standard and of average picture and sound quality. They work fine for the occasional Skype call. - The the model I got came with a 256GB M.2. 2880 SATA SSD B+M key (Kingston RBUSNS8154P3256GJ1) - Also came with 16GB RAM - 2 x 8GB Kingston ACR26D4S9S8ME-8 PC-21300 DDR4 / DDR4-2666 (1333Mhz) - 19-19-19-43 timings. - It's very easy to remove the bottom panel to gain access to an additional M.2 slot and SATA 2.5\" storage bay, both RAM slots, and WiFi mini PCIe card. - The built in speakers produce pretty nice sound, they don't get as loud as I'd like them to be, but are perfectly adequate. - The fans are generally quite, when the system is used for web or light work, the CPU fan is slightly audible. During gaming they ramp up and get louder, and with turbo enabled, they get really loud, like a mini jet, and would be a definite annoyance for those around you. Head phones are recommend. I use turbo mode in PUBG, and it boosts frames anywhere from 10 to 15 extra fps. - The WASD area and palm rest don't get hot during gaming, just a little warm. The area above the keyboard and the num pad areas are where it gets hot. - On battery, I run the laptop in battery saver mode, and get about 4 hours, that's enough for a movie during a flight or several meetings of note taking / email / web. - While gaming I've noticed the battery will tick down while still on AC. I don't know yet if this is an issue. Searching around the web I've found reports that MSI and ASUS laptops do this too and it is by design; supposedly. During the course of a 3 hour gaming session in PUBG and turbo on, my battery drained to 75%. The drain is slower without turbo. I assume after the battery gets low enough, the CPU and GPU will throttle. I plan to reach out to ACER support for the official explanation. - I've picked up a spare AC adapter - included in photo, search Amazon for: 19.5V 9.23A AC Adapter Charger Power Supply for Acer Predator Helios 300 G3-571-77QK, G3-571 G3-572 PH317-51, Acer Aspire V17 Nitro VN7-793G, V15 Nitro VN7-593G Tip 5.5mm, Not Big Tip 7.4mm with Pin - It also fits nicely into Swiss Backpack - J14B-1H-A - 18.5 *12.5*7 (inches) So far I'm very happy with the laptop, it has excellent performance, very nice expandability, is comfortable to use and looks really good."}, {"name": "Evaldas", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "June 12, 2019", "title": "Better then expected", "review_text": "So I'll start with the fact that this laptop came with undervolted cpu which I found kinda strange.

Then if you dare even think about hitting the turbo button the fans go right to 100% and if you don't have noise canceling headphones/headset then you find yourself not being able to hear the game unless you turn it up high enough to drown out the fans. Terrible thermal design as it gives up surface area and has to compensate with stupidly loud fans, it really should be a 17 inch with another heat pipe for both the cpu and gpu or at the very least more dense (or just larger) heat sinks.

I can only compare it to my only other Windows desktop which has the GTX1060 3G card from last year and this laptop is so much faster it is unreal. In one of my games I was getting over 100 FPS during FPP gameplay. Even over WiFi the laptop is responsive. The built in trackpad is okay.  You'll definitely want an external mouse. The included software like Predator Sense is particularly interesting as it provides the ability to overclock the GPU and easily. So far I haven't needed to but as far as having the software already preloaded is neat. Fan noise even without overclocking is noticeable but expected considering how much work this laptop is doing during game play. Audio through my bluetooth headset is really good. The Waves NX technology with my old bluetooth headset does make gameplay a lot better making it easier to hear which direction opponents are coming from. I'm seriously considering getting a NX enable headset to see how much better it could be. WiFi is solid and I'm connected to 5G for gameplay. I've also ordered a PCIe NVMe M.2 module to expand the drive space. The stock NVMe had about 190G available on it so still plenty of space but it is nice being able to expand with the extra empty M.2 slot."}, {"name": "caleb", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "July 4, 2019", "title": "Beast Mode Activate?", "review_text": "This laptop is a beast. I literally haven't found a game in which I can't run at max settings and still get an amazing frame rate. This is all without activating the \"Turbo\" setting which automatically over-clocks everything on your laptop, and cranks up the fans to max speed to keep them cool. This laptop is very sturdily made, and the backlit keyboard is a great addition, although you can not change the colors in this model. Cooling System- The fans and the design do a great job at keeping this beast of a laptop cool, allowing amazing ventilation that blows out the back of the computer. They can get a little loud when running in the above mentioned \"Turbo\" mode. Screen- Great looking screen. I have no issues about the screen. ---Con--- I only have one bad thing to say about this laptop, this being it only has one hard-drive, and it's a measly 256 GB in size. Granted it is a Solid State Hard-Drive that is lightening fast, I do like more storage space, so I purchased a WD 1TB hard-drive to go into the empty additional hard-drive bay. Bottom Line- This is a great laptop, very fast, and reliable. If you're a gamer, or need to run any CPU/GPU intensive software this will not let you down. I highly recommend this beast of a machine."}, {"name": "Nick Perez", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "August 4, 2019", "title": "Seriously Consider This Laptop", "review_text": "All I have to say with this laptop is just wow. Acer has really delivered with this laptop for 2019. Just a quick story, I\u2019m upgrading from a 17\u2019 2014 Asus G751JT that has a GTX970m 3GB, Intel i7 4c/8t 4710hq 2.5ghz/3.5ghz boost, 60hz IPS screen that was $1500 and is 8.6lbs. As a college student, my tolerance for lugging that thing has been getting lower over the years. Also had some infamous battery problems that were annoying. I needed a good overall laptop to fulfill my gaming and study needs as I commute an hour to my university and stay there most of the day.  It\u2019s amazing on how far gaming laptops have gone within the last 5 years. Luckily, I was able to buy this laptop on prime day for $1000 which sold out hours after it got discounted. That speaks volume of how fantastic this laptop is. This won\u2019t be a full-fledged nitty gritty review, so I\u2019ll just stick to my opinions and findings on the product. The laptop feels premium. I\u2019m amazed with the build quality at this price point along with the weight. It\u2019s an eye catcher as I enjoyed looking at this laptop when I first unboxed it. The keyboard is pretty solid as it didn\u2019t take long for me to get used to typing it. To be fair, I have smaller than average hands so your mileage will vary on this. It\u2019s comfortable to type on for me, and I enjoy the sky-blue backlight as I\u2019ve been stuck on red for 5 years. No complaints on the trackpad. It\u2019s a little rough, I wish there were actual physical buttons for right and left click but I mostly stick to my USB mouse. The screen is 144hz and it is BRIGHT. The colors look great and the buttery smooth screen is just an awesome upgrade for me. There is some backlight bleed, but I only notice it on startup and loading screens. I do not notice it during gameplay unless you are playing a game with dark settings. The screen is so good for the price that I am willing to forgive some minor backlight bleed. If this was a $1600+ laptop, then I\u2019d have a serious problem with it. Internet speed is good, no complaints. This laptop comes standard with 2x8gb of ram. Although I might upgrade to 2x16gb of ram down the road if I need to for my Information Technology classes. One thing to note is you definitely need to upgrade the storage in the laptop. You have space for a 2.5 drive and another NVMe ssd.  I\u2019m definitely going to get a 2tb sshd when I have the spare funds; which thankfully Acer provided a kit for a 2.5 drive for your convenience. A 1tb WD Blue is a good m.2 drive to get for storage if you need some fast speeds for any applications that benefit from it like Photoshop or VMware. Now for gaming, I\u2019ll throw in a couple games. The Witcher 3 runs between 70-80fps on ultra-settings. Deus Ex: Mankind Divided was anywhere between 55-70fps on ultra. And for fun, I threw in Rocket League and it maxed out with spare performance to boot. Threw in a heavily modded Fallout New Vegas with 30+ mods and it ran beautifully. Battlefield 4 was a pretty awesome experience too.  Overall, this laptop will handle most, if not, all your gaming needs. What\u2019s great is that I never reached above 75c on the GPU and 80c on the cpu without touching anything on the laptop (Auto fans, no overclocking). The fans are somewhat audible; they never got as loud as turning on the turbo button which is just overkill imo. I usually keep fan speeds at around 85%. Keep in mind, my room temperature was 76F. I definitely don\u2019t recommend any heavy gaming in a quiet place like the library, but if you are then you\u2019re not doing your studying like you should be. Look up a YouTuber named OwnOrDisown. He reviewed the laptop and configured the laptop settings to get a nice middle ground for extra performance. Battery life is anywhere from 3.5 \u2013 5 hours depending on your usage. This is with 20% brightness, max keyboard backlight brightness, and some YouTube in the background while typing up this review on Microsoft word. It\u2019s not a long battery life like some ultra-books, but the battery is enough for me to get through some classes before I have to charge which is fine. I don\u2019t recommend gaming on battery unless it\u2019s a low intensity game like Rimworld, Stardew Valley, or AoEII. Seriously, don\u2019t expect any gaming laptop to run AAA titles at max settings and max performance on battery. It\u2019s unreasonable. One minor annoyance I had was the sound. Apparently, the laptop comes with Acer TrueHarmony that modifies sound by default. If you are hearing an echo-like sound as I was, then I\u2019ll save you the 30 minutes. Open the PredatorSense interface and click on the App Center tab. Open Waves MaxxAudio. Click on the Waves Nx tab and disable the feature. Viola, the echo is gone. You can go back to the MaxxAudio tab and configure the sound properly to your liking. Closing Thoughts: This laptop is a breath of fresh air for me. I was extremely lucky on getting it for $1000. It does so many things right that I\u2019d say it\u2019d warrant the full price (Which is currently $1200 as of the time of writing..or typing? Whatever.) and I\u2019d be ok with it. If you\u2019re considering on getting a laptop, this is one of the few I\u2019d heavily recommend because of the price point.

The UGLY. -  The IPS panel on this machine (which is known for having backlight bleed, or simply put, light spots around the corners) is very fragile. After looking it up, it seems like many many people complain about this problem. To make matters worse, the laptop lid is BENDY, which causes the display to perform even worse. It is made of plastic that feels very cheap. In contrast, the frame around the keyboard is metallic and solid. So, whenever you are watching a movie taking place in a dark setting or nighttime you CAN'T  AVOID seeing white areas. Very annoying. If this is important to you, don't buy it. And if you want to move it around and take it with you a lot, don't buy it either.

Good mix of portability, versatility, gaming, without going too far in either direction (being so thin and light that it can't game, being so powerful that it can't be portable). This is a great middle ground, and an amazing price. I'll now break my review down into different sections. Screen: 144Hz is becoming the norm for gaming laptops, including budget ones. For me, the response time is what makes this screen feel great. The 3ms response time is published prominently on the listing because most gaming laptops have response times at least twice that, and I can tell the difference going from my 144hz 9ms 17\" laptop I previously used. Same refresh rate, different response \"feel\". It's noticeable faster on the Helios. It isn't color-calibrated or anything, and according to experts the colors are just mediocre. To my simple gamer eyes, colors pop and games look great. So it does what it needs to! Gaming: The i7-9750H is the standard for this generation of gaming laptops, and it's just a refresh of the 8750H. 100Mhz faster, it's basically the same. Not too much to discuss about it other than the thermals which I'll discuss more later. The GPU is the new GTX 1660TI. This is why the Helios is relatively \"cheap\" compared to some laptops touting an RTX 2080. Honestly, I've used very powerful gaming laptops, and they do not feel faster. Unless you're going home and hooking the laptop up to a 4k monitor, which you should have a powerful gaming desktop for anyway, you don't need more performance than this. Even with a RTX 2060, the GPU doesn't reach full utilization because the mobile version of Intel's CPUs cannot keep up with the GPU performance. With a 1660ti, you get high settings in games, with over 70-80fps (AAA games), and it's being fully used, so you know that your investment is being put to good use. Keyboard: Acer did an amazing job of mixing a great feel for both typing and gaming. I have not owned the machine for long, but have reached my full typing speed very quickly. Just mushy enough to be comfortable in gaming, but tactile enough for typing to be a breeze and enjoyable. Mousepad: Great for a gaming laptop. The use of Microsoft precision drivers makes it very accurate, and I have been happy with the feel. Click-and-drag functions are easy to do, not something I can say for all laptops. Aesthetics and build quality: The aesthetic is now a blue, not the familiar red that the Helios line has used before. Some non-Amazon models have RGB keyboards, this one does not. I personally don't care, but it's there. In a way I do wish the logo on the back was smaller or less angular, but having my peers know that it's a gaming laptop doesn't really make a difference for me as a student. The build quality is great, and it feels like a quality machine. Yes, the bottom is plastic, but that's true for laptops costing over $2,000 as well. The parts that you touch such as the lid, and keyboard deck are metal, and have no flex in them. It feels like a machine costing hundreds more, evidenced by the fact that Acer uses the same chassis/frame for models costing closer to $2,000. That speaks for itself. Portability: The laptop is relatively thin without compromising on the cooling performance. It is 5 lbs, and this again is good enough without giving up potential performance. The fact that it's 15\" and not 17\" also adds to the portability, if you're thinking about a 17\" and have to move your laptop often, don't do it. The power supply \"brick\" in the cord is also relatively small for the performance you're bringing around. I can carry the laptop with one hand easily, and in a backpack it feels like it isn't there. Battery life is shorter than an ultrabook, sure, but that's what you should expect. 3-4 hours is enough if you're a student in my opinion, and I rarely need to use my laptop when I'm not near a power plug. Thermals/noise: Acer has done some serious engineering here. I have used ASUS, MSI, and even custom-made liquid metal applied laptops. I know what I'm talking about here. Any ASUS I've tried hits 95+ celsius on the CPU right away even in normal gaming, even with the fans all the way up. Seriously, they're horrible. MSI's that I have experience with are actually quite good at cooling, but they were also thicker than this machine. I most recently used a custom-made Eluktronics laptop with optional liquid metal applied for cooling (goes between the CPU and heatsink for maximum heat transfer). This laptop is actually most comparable to that one, and even is slightly better in some ways. Acer has seriously taken into account the thermal paste they use, the construction of the fanblades, and the necessary fan speeds, PLUS, the machine is undervolted from the factory. From stock settings, the CPU stays in the 80s, usually below 85. Given how Intel has not been able to get past their 14nm process, this is sadly a great result. If you use predator sense software and change the GPU overclock to fast or extreme, you get more performance, and louder fans, resulting in slightly lower temps, plus better framerates, going from 70-76 in my borderlands 3 benchmarking. I personally am a tinkerer, and enjoy messing with settings. I used throttlestop and undervolted the CPU more to -.150V, plus adding 15W to the chip's turbo boost power consumption, changing it from 45W to 60W, and changing the turbo boost time window from  28 seconds up to 40. Even with adding a lot of power to the chip, my CPU stays 77-80 now, with a maximum of 81 in games. This is even with the Acer software set to extreme overclocking, and with the fans in their stock overclocked setting. All summed up, as someone who knows a lot about laptops, desktops, and their cooling issues, this is hands-down an amazing feat. Acer is the only manufacturer in the game right now that cares at all about thermals it appears. The changes they've done with the thermal paste, fanblade design, and undervolting is a GREAT innovation. Altogether, this is an amazing laptop. I'd recommend it to anyone looking in the price range, and even those looking closer to the $2,000 price mark, as the 1660ti GPU is really all you need for a gaming laptop, they almost always have 1080p screens anyway. I'm happy I got it on black friday, but it's well worth the $1200 regular price as well. A last note is storage. The laptop only ccomes with 256gb SSD storage. The included SSD is actually NVMe, and extremely fast. Just plan on getting an additional 1tb slower ssd, or even a hdd if you're desperate. Acer has two extra mounting options included, with hardware provided. You can add a 2280 M.2 SSD, or a 2.5\" SSD. You can total have 3 drives in the machine, and that's amazing for a 15\" option. Upgrading is very simple, just need a philips screwdriver, and there's many videos online of how to open this laptop."}, {"name": "Moldovan A.", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "July 8, 2019", "title": "Display backlight visible", "review_text": "All good and fine but I am disappointed with the white visible shades of light on a black image...

It doesn't have the super-premium GPU, and it doesn't have a Displayport capable of driving external monitors at high refresh rates.

No Thunderbolt or USB-C power delivery, etc. No SD card slot for photo mavens. There's no native method to drive more than 1 external display, and if you use a USB 3.0 dock or something you'd probably lose graphics acceleration. But at this price point there is no better travel laptop for gaming. Battery life is poor for gaming (as is always the case when driving an Intel CPU and NVIDIA GPU), but GPU performance on the internal screen is fantastic, and the discrete GPU is automatically turned off when not gaming to extended battery life. Internal storage is tight at 256GB but expansion options are abundant, with both 2.5\" drive slot and NVME slot available for immediate expansion.  Popping a 2.5\" SSD into the slot with the included ribbon cable and rubber bumper was easy-peasy.  Several USB 3.0 ports (3 USB A connectors and 1 USB C connector) provide ample external connectivity. The internal keyboard and touch pad are perfectly adequate, but you're gonna use a mouse + WASD anyway so who cares?

The screen is 144hz IPS, let me tell you, coming from the inspiron 7559 the difference is abismal! you can really notice the 144hz response time. The keyboard is very sturdy and backlit, it has three levels of brightness and has no flex at all, it feels nice and has a good travel. The touchpad is very responsive and uses Microsoft Precision Drivers (which helps). The performance is awesome, having an i7 9750h with 16GB of RAM really makes this laptop fly. I am a software developer and the Nvme included is very fast for such things. The computer can be easily upgraded removing the bottom lid (9 or 10 philips screws), you can add a 2.5 HDD or SSD, another NVME M2 drive or 32GB of RAM, which will make this laptop last a life. Thermals are good, because Acer undervolts the CPU out of the box by -125mV and the completely redesigned cooling system (vs Helios 300 2018) makes this laptop a winner in this section, however, you can reach thermal throttling when having extended sessions of gameplay in a warm environment.

The Decepticon logo and PREDATOR logo across the back aren't exactly appealing. The rest of the laptop is a nice understated black, however, which I appreciate. Keyboard/Touchpad: Nothing special here. The keyboard is serviceable, but not spectacular, the touchpad is a touchpad. Nothing fancy. Performance: Here's where we get to the good stuff. Any other laptop with these same specs is either more expensive, or throttles because it can't cool adequately. The Helios 300, however, has a newly redesigned cooling system that handles gaming without overheating or throttling (tested on Aida64 and Heaven benchmarks). You also get a Full HD 144hz screen. No GSync, but you can't have everything, I suppose. Overall, the price to performance ratio on this laptop is pretty much unbeatable.  Anything else with the same specs either overheats and throttles (Dell, HP, Asus) or is more expensive (Razer, MSI, Lenovo). Acer manages to hit that perfect sweet spot.

Comparable to 1300-1700 gaming laptops. And after opening it up and playing games like RDR2, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Rainbow Six Siege, And even Apex Legends (all on high/ultra settings) - it\u2019s a beautiful and Smooth experience. Very happy. But there\u2019s one downside Of which I make A recommendation to adjust: the 256gb (Hard drive ) storage) just is to small. That\u2019s the big downside with this laptop, that\u2019s not enough room for much games (EX: RDR2 took up >140gb space  alone). Thus what I did immediately after buying was purchase a 1TB SSD 2.5 (Samsung Evo - roughly $150 I paid), And installed it (pretty easy after watching instructions on YouTube for this helio 300 model - but DO NOT attempt to do so unless you\u2019re prepared to void warranty - i.e. unscrewing the laptop bottom I believe voids warranty, that\u2019s What I  read, but not fully sure, so beware). Adding the 1TB SSD gives me significant storage space for my games + much faster Laptop performance (faster bootup, faster game load times, etc). Thus in my opinion, the 2019 Helios 300 + adding 1TB SSD is an amazing purchase and I\u2019m very much enjoying it. Will update of anything changes."}, {"name": "mew380", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "August 15, 2019", "title": "Great gaming laptop overall for the money", "review_text": "I have had this laptop for almost 3 weeks and have been putting it through its paces with general use, games, watching streaming videos, etc. before writing this review. ======= Pros: ======= * Cooling is MUCH improved over the 2018 PH315-51 model and comes factory under-volt by -0.125v which certainly helps. * The screen bezel is a lot thinner than the older models. The screen just feels bigger now even though logically, on paper, a 15.6\" screen is a 15.6\" screen. * Has a DisplayPort * All USB ports are USB 3.0 (Instead of 2x 2.0 and 1x 3.0 as on the older model) * Gaming performance is great * Overall performance is great * Boot time is insanely fast on the NVME drive. Around 10 seconds or so, if that. * Screen is beautiful, colors are vibrant, the view angle is fantastic, and the 144 HZ refresh rate is great; although please see my gripe about discoloration of the top of the screen in the Cons section. * The touch pad is nice and spacious * It is pretty light as far as gaming laptops go. I've seen some people complain that this laptop is heavy; but coming from an older gaming laptop that weighed almost 15 pounds... The weight of this laptop is a major relief! * The keys are back-lit which is great for low-light/night time computing/gaming * The chassis is nice. The top (back of the screen) and the keyboard area is metal, while the bottom and the bezel surrounding the screen is durable plastic. I absolutely love how nice and cool the metal is against my wrists when I'm typing. ======= Cons: ======= * My biggest gripe about this laptop is that there is visible light/color distortion at the top of the screen that is very noticeable against dark backgrounds. This is very distracting if you're watching a movie and there's dark scenes, or if you like to play horror games where typically the environment is dark. I've noticed a lot of people calling this light bleed and I've seen multiple screenshots of the effect; but this isn't light bleed (Well, it might be in the technical sense of the word). You know how if you press your finger lightly against an LCD screen (I'm NOT recommending that you do this by the way), it discolors slightly around the area where you touched? That is what's happening here. Apparently the bezel at the top of the screen is pressing WAY too freaking tight against the top of the screen (From factory!) and causing the discoloration at the top of the screen. I can't imagine that this is good for the health of the screen. This NEEDS to be fixed. * NVME drive is small at 256 GB. There is 237 GB usable, but realistically, there is less than that due to operating system install, so there is more around 130 - 150 GB of free space for applications, games, etc. You can load a handful of modest sized games or one huge game (Doom 2016 is around 80 - 100 gigs after patches and Final Fantasy XV is around 90 gigs after patches. Sheesh, game sizes are getting absolutely ridiculous!). That little drive will be hurting for free space in no time at all after a few games are installed. You will definitely want to add a spare drive to put games on. Acer claims that the laptop is expandable with a second NVME drive and a 2.5 inch bay (Which does include the connector you need for it in the package), but the entire back has to come off if you want to put a drive in internally, and you might void the warranty in the process if you do it yourself; so it's not a false claim, but it's a 'gotcha' claim. An external USB drive is the way to go if you want to remain on the safe side and don't want to pay a tech to put a drive in for you. * Battery life is OK; not great, but not bad either. When not gaming it can get about 3 - 4 hours of light use. It is absolutely horrendous when gaming at approximately 50 minutes, give or take a few depending on the game. Although I will say that this is to be expected from a gaming laptop. It's a lot of power packed into a tiny device. You will definitely want to be plugged in if you want to game on it for any extended length of time. * The webcam is horrible. It is -technically- HD in resolution, but only in resolution. The picture quality resembles early 2000s webcams. The video quality is something between a VHS recording and low quality grainy DVD. You'll either want to get an external webcam or pass this laptop up for a different one because this webcam sorely disappoints. It will work in a pinch though. I will note that it helps a bit to have a very well lit room if you want to use the webcam; even so, it's still pretty bad in my opinion. In the end it doesn't matter to me personally since I don't use webcam that often anyway. * The sound quality of the microphone is not fantastic. It sounds like someone is talking through a tin can. Like the webcam though, It will work in a pinch. I don't use microphones that much anyway, so it isn't a big deal for me. * The speakers sound piercing and tinny. No bass whatsoever. This is to be expected though, most laptops don't have the greatest speakers anyway. Use headphones or an external speaker system whether wired or blue tooth. * Acer seems bent on making installing your own OS on this laptop as hard as possible; even if you want to install a different edition of Windows 10 (For example: It comes with Windows 10 Home but you want to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro). It is doable but be prepared to do a little digging and research to figure out how to do it. I would expect this kind of crap on a low end cheap laptop, but NOT on an expensive gaming laptop! * UEFI/BIOS settings are bare minimal. You can tweak a few boot settings and that is about it. It is definitely NOT a power user's utility. Again, I expect this on a low end laptop, not a gaming laptop. ============================================= Mixed Feelings that are neither Pro nor Con for me: ============================================= * Although cooling is much improved over last year's model, for some games, you will want to turn the fan to max. Keep an eye on PredatorSense temps. I personally prefer to max the fans if I notice the temps getting higher than about 75, but that's just me. * There is a very limited amount of USB ports if you're not counting the USB-C connector, there are 3x USB 3.0 ports. Invest in a powered USB hub if you need to plug in more than just a keyboard and mouse (Because who wants to game on a laptop keyboard and touch pad unless they had no choice?) * USB-C connector is data only; does not output video * There is no optical disc drive. Not a big deal since USB drives are cheap nowadays, but it would have been nice to have. * The touch pad doesn't seem to have the capability to scroll window contents like a lot of laptops have on the side of the touch pad that I can tell. You will be making good friends with the Up, Down, Page Up, and Page Down keys if you don't want to use the scroll bars in your window(s) and don't have an external mouse hooked up. * You have to be slightly heavy handed on the touch pad but this may come down to user preference. Personally I'm fine with it and I'll be hooking an external mouse to it whenever possible anyway. * Keyboard back lights are not RGB. They are solid blue/light blue in color, you can toggle them on or off, and set a few different levels of brightness on them. Not a big deal for me though; I'm just happy being able to see the keyboard in the dark. * There is pretty minimal bloatware pre-installed, but it is no where near as bad as other computer brands. I would consider it a reasonable amount to be honest. * The dual GPU set up can be confusing at first. A tip for anyone first time to dual GPU: If you're having trouble figuring out why some applications are performing badly and they don't seem to be using the nVidia GPU; close the program, then right click it, and chose Run application with GPU > High performance nVidia. You can also set up an application profile in the nVidia control panel for your program to use which ever GPU you want if you want the program to always run with that. Despite some faults with this laptop, overall, I like this laptop a lot."}, {"name": "hza3", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "September 28, 2019", "title": "I finally got my dream gaming laptop ^_^", "review_text": "This laptop is amazing, I can't describe it in few words this will take a lot of time to and I want to write a short review as much as I can. So I got this laptop on the gamer's day deal for 1000$ and that is a great value for me since I was looking for this laptop since 2018, my previous laptop was MSI GL62M, and I sell it when I got my new Acer Predator Helios 300, it have more RAM, stronger CPU, GPU and much powerful gaming screen with 144Hz. I have few notes over all my use in the last 3 weeks since I got it, the laptop makes an echo when I take the charger out while I wear my headphones and that's a little bit annoying and when you pull the charger out it makes a sound and I don't like it as well, the screen is perfect, but before I purchase this laptop people kept saying that there is a screen bleed on the top of the screen, and that is not a screen bleed at all, it from the manufacturer, since it is pressing so hard on the top side of the screen and that what make the white color showing, but in my case this not annoying at all, and I don't notice it at all and I am really happy with it. another thing that the charger place is different than any other laptop I use in my life which is on the middle left side of the laptop and that's a kinda annoying me as well, also one time I was playing games and the predator sense was working on background and I wanted to use the max fans speed ( which are really loud when they are on ) it didn't work and I had to close it and launch it again and it worked. Turbo button works well and the installation of the HDD was very easy and works perfect ( I bought a Seagate firecuda 2TB from amazon on a deal for 65$ only and this SSHD works really well - also I install it with Justech screwdriver which is also from amazon ). I recommend who buy this laptop to get a cooling pad with it because it get really hot when playing high FPS games like PUBG, Fortnite, overwatch and other games, because it will help lowing down the temperature so much. Final review: The material that used to build this laptop is really good, blue color that added to this years model is just insane and beautiful, you can open the laptop with one finger easily, but what annoys me that fingerprints are staying and you have to clean them daily if you want to keep you laptop clean. Screen is good for me even with the white pressure on the middle top screen on and sometimes I don't even notice it. GPU and CPU are just amazing for this price point and they work perfectly with no problems at all, just watch out for the temperature. keyboard is well built and I have no problems typing on it and im writing this review while using the laptop keyboard, also the blue back-lit looks amazing at night when the lights around you are off, I really like it. track-pad is really annoying as well, you feel like your fingers are sticking when ever you move around, I recommend every one to get a mouse to avoid using it, this the most part that I didn't like about this laptop. sound feels amazing on this laptop, and I can hear my favorite music on it and listen to video's without any problem at all, It feels nice to listen to favorite stuff on this laptop Audio with this phenomenal quality. Battery gives me around 4 hours while I don't play, just watching movies and browsing and it last for long time, but when I am playing games it gives me around 1:00 to 1:30 hours at max while gaming. webcam is coming at 720p30 which is not that much and If you a kind of person that use laptop for streaming and video calling and you want who watch you in a better picture you may want to get a better external webcam. The advertising of this laptop for the Killer Doubleshot Pro Wi-Fi card is not for nothing I really feel it is download stuff more faster than my previous laptop and I really like it. well done Acer. Storage comes with a kingstone 256GB PCIe M.2 drive is installed, It works perfectly and fast on day to day tasks and I really appreciate Acer for this SSD that they installed. Well thanks for continuing reading this article to the end, and I am sorry for making it so long as I say I will try to make it as shot as I can xD, I got excited and kept writing. thank you all and I hope for you a wonderful life. ^_^"}, {"name": "Amazon Customer", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "June 27, 2019", "title": "Best Gaming Value!!", "review_text": "I recently got a job that requires me to travel a lot.

I dropped some setting in shooter games and easily get over 144FPS. You can not ask for much more out a gaming laptop, and all for $1200.

If I plug in more than one USB device (USB-C + Type A or two Type A), then my externally attached USB mouse stops working and the second device may or may not work depending on the type of device plugged in.  It does not matter if I am using a high end Logitech mouse or a cheap wired MS USB mouse, the USB port is just functionally not working.  Yes, this could be driver issues but, Intel and NVIDIA drivers are up to date and say they are functioning.  So, this leads me to believe it is a BIOS issue. By the way, the BIOS is useless because it has practically no options loaded into it.  I don't know how a company in the year 2019 gets away with creating a BIOS that has literally no options available for edit like this but, Acer has pulled this off.  This also leads to my suspicions about my USB problem being a BIOS issue.  If I could mess around or even determine the method the USB is configured by the BIOS, I may be able to resolve my own problem! Also, be advised the USB-C port may be a USB v3.1 Gen 2 port but, it is NOT a Thunderbolt 3 port so do not expect TB3 devices to work with this laptop.  I can't confirm it is an actual Gen 2 port because, like I said above, I cannot connect two USB devices to this laptop....I don't know why it has 4 USB ports because they can't be used.

I bought this mostly because I needed a laptop for college, and the fact that it was a \"gaming\" laptop is just a plus because hey, who doesn't want that? Being busy with college, I have not used it to game. I played Minecraft and Stardew Valley on it for only a few hours and THAT'S IT since I bought it.

That'd be an option if they had told me sooner, but I definitely don't trust them to do it in a timely matter now.

I did go ahead and purchase a Samsung EVO SSD to add additional storage space, but for the price of the system at the time ($999) I am not complaining - and I would recommend the EVO SSD over a traditional secondary storage drive.  The speed difference is night and day when installing and playing games. If you are looking for a nice portable gaming system, this is for you.  If you are wanting to stream to a service such as Twitch, this system would also fit the bill.  It includes the on-board Intel graphics and the Nvidia discrete graphics.  OBS is very happy with this configuration, and with the i7, there is enough power to go stream and game.

First, the good. This laptop is so powerful and fast. The game engine works smoothly and can play almost all the games out there at full setting, with a but of problem. It gets hot, very hot. Almost 90 degrees celsius hot. The fan at full blast can lower it to at least 75 degrees but this full blast is loud. Like there is a jet plane 30 miles outside your room but right in front of you and not as loud. And here is the USB and other connection problem, still. The others made the same complaints before by the looks of it. If more than 3 powerful devices are connected (USB or blue tooth and etc.) The whole thing disconnects and tries to reconnect. I have to disconnect the thing I don't use at the moment and reconnect if I need it again. For a powerful laptop, it is disappointing. My main concern is the heat and the USB connection. The loudness of the fan is not my concern if it did its job, cooling the laptop.

I got it on sale on Prime Day for under $1000. I had my last laptop for 5 years, a bottom of the line Alienware with a GTX 860m in it. This laptop completely blow it out of the water, as it should. I was going back and forth between getting this one or one that had an RTX 2060 and ultimately decided the GTX 1660 ti was the better value. It seems once you get into the RTX 2060 and above you start to get diminishing return in the laptop field due to less effective cooling in laptops. I looked at a lot of benchmarks done across numerous laptops, and there wasn\u2019t a big enough performance gain, in my opinion, to warrant the $300 to $1000 price increases.

Gaming on a 15.6\" screen will take some getting used to. (My previous gaming laptops were ASUS ROG models with 17 inch screens, and my desktop has a 27\" monitor.) but the picture quality is the best I've seen. The Predator has some great components with the 9th gen i7 processor, the Nvidia 1660 Ti GPU, 16 GB of RAM and an NVMe SSD. The SSD is 256 GB so I added a Seagate Firecuda 2TB hybrid drive for an additional expense of $80. In addition, the Killer networking hardware/software seems to work very well. That's the good. The bad is that it comes with Windows 10 (but what's a practical alternative?), and Microsoft is very aggressive in pushing its services. It can be difficult if not impossible to remove them. I make my own choices for browser, search engine, email clients, etc, but when I removed Edge I got notifications every time I started up on my startup screen pushing Edge and not once but twice. ( I think and hope I finally removed it. I'm not a fan of advertising, and I don't trust Microsoft.) And I'm not willing to trust \"the cloud\", so Dropbox and cloud storage were refused. I've downloaded several games onto the hybrid drive but only played Destiny 2 for about an hour and a half and a little of Age of Wonders III. As I said the graphical quality is the best I've seen, but Destiny 2 did freeze after I'd been playing for an hour or so which I assume was due to the GPU overheating (and I do use a notebook cooler), but I'm also assuming there are things I can do to prevent this in the future. For one thing, the game was optimized by the Nvidia GeForce Experience software and I'll have to look at their selections. I should also adjust the fan speeds, but I haven't looked into this yet either. So, if I should have to amend this review (and recommendation) in the future I will do so, but so far I'm very impressed with what Acer has provided and at what cost. I gave battery life and camera quality three stars because the laptop will always be plugged in, and I'll rarely if ever use the camera (though from what I've seen in YouTube reviews the image quality is certainly IMO acceptable for ordinary uses). Update: On the day after I wrote this review, I played some Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Dragon Age: Inquisition, WOW, Alpha Centauri and more Destiny 2. GeForce Experience optimized the games at ultra quality. I tinkered with the fan settings setting them slightly higher than standard (about 4000-4200 rpms and will fine adjust this more). The games looked great and played well without any problem. The fans did make some noise, but it's a whoosh and not a whine, and for me not terribly intrusive. As I said, I'll adjust the fan speed some more and may be able to reduce it even further. The speakers by the way are great with excellent sound quality and volume for a laptop. The fan noise never interfered with the sound at my settings. Again, well done, Acer. Two months later, and I'm still very impressed with this computer. I installed the new Crytek Neon Noir Ray Tracing Benchmark for ray-tracing effects without an RTX gpu, ran it fullscreen at 1920x1080 and ultra and got a score of 5529 with very fluid playback and frame rates that varied from about 45 to the upper 70s. The benchmark would seem to be quite the workout for a system and the Acer got a commendable result IMO."}, {"name": "Misu", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "August 25, 2019", "title": "Great budget gaming laptop that performs above it's class.", "review_text": "This is my second purchase of a gaming laptop over thr 2019 summer. The first was by another large brand and was a total bust,  returned within the 30 day amazon window due to serious hardware issues right out of the box. This one had restored my faith in buying gaming laptops online without being able to \"test\" them out. If you understand what you're getting with this machine and have a very clear picture what it is you want out of it, then this is a fantastic machine. The graphics card is powerful enough to run most modern games at mid to high settings with zero issues. The powerful CPU and mid tier specs set you up at a good starting point to boot up and game, literally right out of the box, with little need to really add anything other than a good gaming mouse. The screen is one of the better ones and usually can be found on more expensive laptops. I have very minimal light bleed on mine and it's not noticeable at all during normal use. The keyboard is comfortable to work on although the letters are a bit squished together so it did take me a little bit to get used to. Upgrading is super simple. I had a second SSD hard drive installed within 5 minutes of popping the bottom off the laptop and there is still space to add yet another drive. At this time, I've got a second 500 gig drive to complement the main 250g drive and I also have a portable 250g Samsung rugged ssd drive that uses the 3.1 USB C port should I need even more space. This laptop, for me, is not a replacement for my desktop. It's just a really nice partner to it for those days I want to snoodle up on the couch and game with my dog on my lap. It runs warmer than some other laptops but this is normal. It's a gaming laptop. It's actually quite good for gaming laptop standards. The fans work really well but can get loud so you'll need headphones or a cooling pad underneath to help with that. I use a cooling pad and the noise doesn't bother me or anyone else when I decide to game a bit while watching a movie with the boyfriend on the couch. I installed an app that monitors CPU and GPU temps and it's never gone above 75c while gaming. While doing regular stuff, its in the low 30s and the fans run near silent. Battery is poor so stay plugged in and you'll be fine while you game. When not gaming and just doing regular stuff, the battery might last 3.5 hours if you dim the screen to 50 percent. This honest doesn't affect me much. When I use it, I stay pluggef in. If I need longer battery life, I have two other laptops specifically purchased for productivity that I can use to solve that issue. It's quite small and light for how powerful it is and for being a 15 inch monitor. I love that because as a female who often likes to game while she travels, I don't want to lug around heavy bulky gear just to do that. This little guy lets me pop it into my thin laptop sleeve along with it's charger, which is also a nice compact size, and my gaming mouse and earbud headphones and I'm good to go. Also, it doesn't scream gamer the colors are a soft white and blue and the design itself is nice but not aggressive like their Helios 300 of last year, which I purchased as a gift for my sister.  Happy girl here. All in all, I'm really happy with this purchase and can see that this laptop will last me at least 4 to 5 years gaming-wise because of the powerful components Acer used. This little fella is definitely a declaration against all other gaming laptop companies out there. For what I needed and wanted, it's perfect. Beautiful screen, powerful components, upgradeability in memory and storage, small compact size, and tech that will still be viable a few years down the line.

I bought it for $1200 and before it could ship I saw it go on sale for $999 for prime day. So I quickly canceled that order and bought it at the sale price, which sold out fast. Thanks Amazon! As of the time of this review it is on sale again for $999, if you are on the fence, don't be, buy it now! I love this laptop. It plays all modern games I have on Ultra with zero issues. I have about 100 hours now in the Witcher 3, simply beautiful. I have tested other games such as metro Exodus, ff14, AC: Odyssey, Farcry 5, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, etc. All perform flawlessly on max settings However, the machine does get quite hot. As other reviewers have pointed out it is normal for gaming laptops to operate between 75 - 90 celcius. I've also noticed this laptop is cooler when you are in a cooler environment. I spend half my time in Mexico and half in Seattle. While gaming in Seattle the laptop doesn't go past 85, while in Mexico it will easily reach mid 90s. Unfortunately in this case since it comes undervolted to -.125 there's not much you can do besides setting fans to Max in the predator sense application, which definitely will cool it back down to 78-82. I also always use it on my lap with a laptop cooler, which does not affect the temperature for better or worse. Aside from gaming, it also handles everyday computing excellently. I do suggest getting a 2.5\" SSD for additional storage. The keyboard is very good, even though it is strangely placed. The mousepad is a good size, but is hard to click effectively, so I suggest getting a decent gaming mouse. The screen hinge is like firm butter, and the top of the lid and keyboard area is aluminum, hardly seen in a laptop at this price point. In my opinion, it is going to be hard to beat this laptop unless you spend more than $2k.

It can handle any game you throw at it. Features: Turbo button. If you're anything like me the idea of tinkering and micro managing settings seems tedious. \"Say no more!\" says Acer and they provide a turbo button. With 1 press you automatically overclock your gpu and cpu and boost your fans to get the most out of your latpop! Predator button: Another wonderful addition. With a press of a button you can bring up a management screen to adjust everything. You can set bandwidth priority you can set fan speed. If you like to tinker, this is wonderful. Hardware: This laptop is an amazing piece of equipment for the price. Especially if you catch it on sale like I did for prime day ($999 are you kidding me?!). You would be hard-pressed to build a desktop with this much power for the same price, including a 144hz monitor. Speaking of 144 hz: As someone who has never played at anything over 60hz this is amazing. Its so smooth! The 1660ti makes gaming at 1080/ultra a breeze for most games. The not so good: While the monitor is literally amazing, there are some spots along the edges during black screens. I assume this is just something we have to live with as most reviews mention it. The hard drive expansion, while not difficult warrants some research. Instead of simply having a plug and play SATA cable for a second hard drive acer sends you a cable and a rubber case of sorts. It is  not particularly difficult to install but you can damage your laptop if you don't know what you're doing. At the very least watch a YouTube video. Overall: This laptop is amazing for the price. This is THE BEST budget gaming option of the year.

There is a software bug that if you connect an external monitor and in display settings you decide to display to the external monitor and the external monitor alone, and you use an external controller like I do (USB controller), any click of the buttons or movement of the joysticks destroys the FPS of the game you're playing and make it literally unplayable. The workaround is to choose \"Extend desktop\" and just run the game on your external monitor and leave the laptop screen as just the desktop. Note: This bug was not present on a dell gaming laptop. Because of the extend desktop, this workaround works and there's no real issue here, just something to note.

It\u2019s all plastic but their is very little flex in the keyboard, the frame is solid and there is almost no flex in the screen. Reviews have stated the keyboard deck and cover are aluminum. This one definitely isnt - its a very hard plastic. There is significant light bleed around the bezel edges when the screen is dark. It almost appears as if the bezels are too tightly attached to the display. I don\u2019t see the bleed much when the screen is displaying graphics/programs/colors. It\u2019s extremely quiet, but that\u2019s probably because I\u2019m just sitting setting it up and don\u2019t have any programs running.

I had purchased a 17 inch Lenovo Y740 as a second laptop but cancelled it for a 15 inch Y740.

The keys are illuminated in light blue which can be made darker or lighter with two of the F keys. The blue light isnt annoyingly bright or obnoxious like some laptops I have seen. There are a few bloatware programs added by Acer onto this laptop. I would suggest a clean install of Win10 and then heading to Acer to download their Predator Sense program.

It does get hot if you don't crank up the fans, but the controls for that are just a simple button push and it goes into Turbo mode. It has a feature called Predator Sense, which gives you control of overclocking the GPU and adjusting the fan speeds, plus it gives you a history graph of the CPU/GPU temps and processing percentages. Under full gaming load playing Shadow of War I typically see temps of about 140 degrees Fahrenheit.

Battery life is not the greatest, but I knew that before I got it. On average it says it has about 3 hours remaining when using it mobile, though I have never used it unplugged for more than about and hour or so. Also, it will not let you use Turbo mode unless it is plugged in which is reasonable since it would probably drain the battery really fast anyway. I carry it with me to school in my Swiss Gear 1900 backpack and it doesn't seem to add much weight to my load. Also the WiFi reception is very good and almost always has full signal anywhere I use it. Because of the aluminum body, it feels very high quality.

It's powerful, and it fills my needs well. I use programs such as Premiere Pro, After Effects and Unity and I also play games like Apex Legends and Fortnite on it. This computer handles these tasks well. There are few things that really annoy me about this laptop. The keyboard is off center by A LOT. I'm constantly hitting the Predator button when I code and it gets to be incredibly annoying as time wears on. I don't use the number pad often, if ever, so I could have done without it and that would have helped with the centering of the keyboard. The shift key on the right is also too small. The second thing that bothers me is the speaker(s). They are in the front of the computer so if the computer is on your lap, the sound will probably be quite muffled. When it's on a hard surface, it sounds better but the sound itself is not of great quality. For reference, my 2012 MacBook Air's speakers have a more full sound and are head and shoulders above the speakers in this laptop. The third thing that bothers me is the fact that the computer cannot adjust brightness appropriately, automatically, when it's removed from AC power (my MacBook Air does). The same goes for when you plug in headphones or unplug them: there is no separate volume for headphones vs. the laptop's speaker.

(I do intensive CPU and GPGPU computations.) I have used this laptop for a few months now. Good things: - Good thermal performance. Has the option to quiet the fan in an office or library setting, but has the CoolBoost feature to provide some additional RPM. Even so, I'm using a cooling pad. The CPU is 6 cores so anything that is CPU-intensive will need to have more heat dissipated than a 4 core laptop with the same chassis. They undervolted from the factory which definitely helps cool it down by a few degrees. I really appreciate how quiet it is. It will almost certainly not draw attention in a quiet room. Of course, don't take it for granted - a high ambient temperature will easily nullify all these gains. - The boot time is consistently about 5-6 seconds. Much better than the 15 seconds my previous laptop had even after I replaced its hard drive with an SSD. You can use the PredatorSense software to disable the sound during boot time. Worth noting: - Keyboard keys. I would have preferred a dedicated power button off to the side instead of it being part of the keyboard. I have not accidentally pressed it while cleaning the keyboard but it is of note. As someone who uses the number pad quite frequently, the placement of the right arrow and the 0 key might take a bit of getting used to. The keys themselves have good action through and I have not had any problems with key presses. The sides are white and the WASD and arrow keys have a blue edge to them, which is much better than the red theme of the previous laptop. The backlit is fine but I do not use it at all - the white sides already help with visibility. - Bloatware. As usual, uninstall all the garbage that comes with it. There are a few that you might not want to uninstall, especially the PredatorSense software (activated by the key next to NumLock). I also make sure to regularly clear space, especially after a Windows update. The default storage is 256 GB so it will quickly fill up. - Battery. I have gotten a rather wide variation of battery life. It is definitely not designed to be long-lasting 8-10 hours; you will need to bring your charger for extended periods. Tips to save battery life apply to every laptop. Most important is to dim the screen as much as possible and to minimize the time of tasks that end up increasing RPM, including surfing the web (note the high CPU and RAM usage by Firefox, Chrome, etc; and no videos, streaming!). Unlike my previous laptop, you have to take the bottom lid to expose the battery so you cannot replace it with a larger one. - External monitor. The HDMI works, but if you have a 60 Hz monitor, the laptop screen will also go down to 60 Hz if a video is playing on the monitor, such as a Twitch stream or a YouTube video. If, on the monitor screen, you go to a different tab, you get back 144 Hz on the laptop. The 144 Hz is very smooth and it adds a lot to the experience. - Webcam. Somehow something got messed up during initial configuration, and very early on, the webcam light turned on whenever I watched a video on YouTube. Very strange, almost like the NSA was spying on me. Luckily I do not use the webcam at all and disabled it. For those that do, make sure you fidget around with the settings until it works. - Audio. The speakers are not great, use a headset. And DO make sure to uncheck the \"Enable audio enhancements,\" which may be on by default and produces a much worse sound than if it were disabled. Even a tone-deaf person can tell the difference. Not sure why the option even exists, to be honest. Nitpicks: - Outer design. I don't mind the logo, but I wish that they removed the blue streaks, which detract from a professional look. In terms of bringing this laptop to a meeting or other professional setting, it's on the edge between sleek and tacky, in my opinion. It can be mitigated by putting on some laptop stickers for those who are into that. I have noticed much criticism on the internet about the flashy looks of most gaming laptops, but frankly, I wouldn't be too self-conscious about how your laptop looks. - There is a weird thing where the screen flashes red for a few frames before returning to normal every time it brings up the login screen. This happens both upon startup and after pressing Windows-L. I do not know what is causing this but it is slightly annoying. - There is a moderately loud beep that sometimes happens when I plug in the charger before turning the laptop on or while it is booting, or awaking the laptop from sleep. Also slightly annoying. The loudness of the beep seems to be independent of the speaker volume. Overall, great laptop and great value too. Don't be dissuaded by the number of cons vs. pros in my list, they are very minor compared to all the great things that this device offers."}, {"name": "Saad", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "August 9, 2019", "title": "It's the best laptop for the price if you do photo/video editing or gaming/power demanding work.", "review_text": "Edit: If you are using ethernet cable for gaming and it's not working properly, go in \"Killer Control Center\" then go in settings and turn off \"Advanced Stream Detect\". Amazing laptop for the price, really good desgin (thermals aswell) and quite compact compared to last year's model. There is back light bleed but only noticeable when displaying something completely dark/black (for example when laptop is booting up.) and some back light bleed is in all models of helios 300 so don't worry about it. Also black light bleed is not noticeable at all during normal use or whilst gaming. However, if you see more than expected back light bleed, do contact amazon tech help and sort it out. Battery life is actually better than expected for this power hungry gaming laptop with such a small battery. I highly recommend getting a 2.5\" or m.2 nvme ssd. There is one empty slot for 2.5\" hdd/ssd and one empty m.2 slot (with another m.2 slot having 256gb ssd pre-installed). I'd suggest 1tb m.2 nvme ssd which goes for around $100 on amazon. Keybaord is really good, though it comes with just blue backlight & no rgb, that rgb model for same price is only available in Australia. You can get rgb model on amazon but you will have to pay more and you will get 512gb m.2 ssd instead of 256gb which is installed in this one. Trackpad is also better than expected since you usually have low expectations from trackpad in a gaming laptop, where you would plug external mouse for gaming anyway. USB-C port does not support thunderbolt 3 or video output, it's just for connecting external USB-C devices, or dongles if you want more ports. Display is really good, 144hz refresh rate ~ 3ms response time makes it one of the best displays in laptop of this price point & bezels are way smaller compared to last year's model. It also feels and looks much lighter than last year's model thanks to compact degsin and actual weight decrease of about 250g from last year's model. Do enable turbo mode (by pressing the turbo button) if you do anything demanding as it will increase the fan speed, so no thermal throttling, it would increase cpu power limit and overclock gpu to extreme. You will get better performance for both gpu & cpu and even ram this way. In my opinion it's the best laptop for the price (I paid $1200 but you can get it for $999 on prime day) if you do photo/video editing or gaming/high performance demanding work."}, {"name": "Noah", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "July 10, 2019", "title": "Strange echo", "review_text": "great computer with great performance and quality except i hear a constant echo when audio is played.

I tried upgrading the OS and BIOS to see if it would fix the issue, but it didn't seem to. Eventually, it got stuck in the overheating state for some amount of time while I wasn't around. I'm assuming it was for hours, and when I tried to power it on, it couldn't see the internal disk, so it wouldn't boot. I booted with a Linux USB drive and it seems that the memory and CPU are fine, but Linux couldn't see the boot disk, either.

It's distracting when browsing the web or watching a show without headphones on. During gaming the fan noise gets pretty loud, around 55 dB, but that's to be expected. The predator sense software has limited functions in terms of adjusting fan speed, the lowest setting is around 2500 rpm for the CPU and around 2800 rpm for the GPU.

I spend many many days researching trying to find that perfect computer and this was a great option. Let me go through the pros and cons... Pros: 144hz screen - never actually had anything over 60hz because it\u2019s hard to get anything higher for cheap so this was a great treat and is buttery smooth. 1660 Ti - probably the main reason a lot of people get this laptop, the graphics card is great, it\u2019s relatively new, has 6gb memory. This card will run circles around the 1050ti and gives desktop GPUs a run for there money. CPU - has a great cpu which is very easily over clockabke via the settings, you can set the speed, fan speed and more. Small bezels - compared to some the bezels on this are quite good, the sides and top are narrow, bottom isn\u2019t too bad at all. Overall a nice size screen for viewing. Keyboard - mine only had a blue black light which is okay because I love blue. The keyboard feels good, nice quality and not too loud. Cons: Battery life is poor - can\u2019t get much use out of it but how often are you not near an outlet Light up logo on lid - really wish you could turn it off makes it look kinda cheesy and gamey, not super professional. All in all this is a great laptop for the money. So should you get this? Well if you want a laptop that is pretty sleek, fast, and can run almost any game on the market at high 60fps or higher. People do mention bad screen bleed, either I got a lucky unit or they are over exaggerating because I have very little if any. I do recommend a ssd addition the 256gb stock is small. There is an option for both a m.2 ssd and or a 2.5\u201d drive. Plenty of room to add storage. Best of luck on your decision!"}, {"name": "Nick", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "November 17, 2019", "title": "Monster gaming laptop for affordable price", "review_text": "Alright, so let me clarify a few things for those of you who have extreme OCD like myself: * Despite review models and seemingly even some customer models having this feature, the two lines on the back of the laptop nor the Turbo button light up. They look like they should, but they don\u2019t. Myself and some friends all have this laptop and none of ours light up, but I\u2019ve seen it in review videos and even the amazon reviews. It must just be a review model feature. Now that that\u2019s out of the way... this thing is a BEAST. Performs at or above most laptop models with RTX 2060\u2019s and 2070\u2019s. If you want anything less than an RTX 2080 this laptop is the ONLY one that makes sense unless you\u2019re really set on getting a laptop with a ray tracing card in it. You cannot beat the performance of this monster for the small price. 256GB SSD is small for games, so I went ahead and ordered a 2TB external HDD so I can run my games off of it, easy fix and I recommend you do the same so you\u2019re not frolicking around your drive all day trying to find where you can cut a gigabyte or two. Since it appeared that a LOT of people got a lemon with this laptop (see the 1 star reviews) I was determined to test mine heavily the first day to ensure mine wasn\u2019t. Charging port seemed weird but ended up just being me, it\u2019s a little tight and I\u2019m a little bit of an OCD freak. Ran prime95 for 10+ minutes finding no issues or errors and not reaching anything too high in regards to temps, very impressive. Also ran Heaven afterward and jacked the resolution up, ran very smoothly with an occasional hitch which was likely due to the Intel power saving settings that I later on changed, but it ran perfectly. Loaded up Borderlands 3, Overwatch, and CS:GO, all ran perfectly without a hitch. Overall I almost didn\u2019t order this laptop due to the one star reviews but I\u2019m glad I did, I encourage you to try it if you too are holding off due to the apparent high volume of lemons. Running 1.08 BIOS and it\u2019s smooth as butter, couldn\u2019t be happier with it so far. Temps also haven\u2019t hit over 83, and went as low as 20\u2019s idle when I left it running while I was at work. 0 regrets and I\u2019ll likely be buying next generation of the Helios as well."}, {"name": "Ephrem Molina", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "July 18, 2019", "title": "Probably The Best Deal For A While", "review_text": "Look I see some peoples reviews having issues with their laptops, but those are far few in between.

The 1660TI performs incredibly well at 1080p, taking full advantage of the 144hz display. The i7 CPU boost and maintains 4ghz regularly without hitting thermal throttle. It can handle VR (I tested with a rift s), and every modern title that I've thrown at it well over 100fps. Almost every other laptop at this price includes the MAX-Q version of the 1660TI, which is about 40% slower, or the significantly worse 1650. The full 1660 TI in this laptop can nearly match the performance of 2070 MAX-Q and 2060 GPU's in more expensive laptops. I reduced one star for a couple minor complains: - The screen, while bright and vivid, does have some backlight bleed in the corners. Some have it worse than others, but its acceptable on my device. It doesn't show in games, even in dark areas, and is only really noticeable when booting up. There is also some IPS glow, but that is just a part of using that tech for the screen. - Battery life is pretty bad, even in a low power non-gaming use case. If you need to use this portably without a reliable power source for more than a couple of hours, look elsewhere. - Its loud. If you use 'turbo' to get the max clock speed on the GPU/CPU, it ramps the fans up to 100% and is audible even through headphones. Luckily, I haven't found a need to use turbo mode yet. Even more demanding VR games run very well on the 'fast' GPU setting. Overall, if you're looking for a mid-range gaming laptop, the helios 300 is by far the best available in the ~$1000 price range."}, {"name": "Mario Adaime", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "November 26, 2019", "title": "Best overall better price pc for gaming", "review_text": "Pros: Better overall performance for the price Compact design compared with the previous model New dedicated predator sense button, overclocking ready to use 144 fps Nice predator blue lighted icon For sure my next gaming laptop is going to be a predator but with a decent SSD Cons Mine didn't come with the kit to install an additional internal ssd, wrote to acer, no international delivery for that stuff, call local Acer: sorry we can't get the kit... so no internal ssd, but I got an external ssd usb-c, works fine, but acer costumer service... not so good.

This poses a problem, because you can not change the boot priority.  I took the M.2 out of my old Acer E 15 and planned on formatting it to use in the Predator.  Upon installation and boot up, it actually booted into Windows from the E 15 M.2 drive...NOT the drive that the Predator originally shipped with.  I switched sides, moving the Predator M.2 to the right side M.2 drive and the E 15 M.2 to the left, where the Predator's M.2 was previously located.  Received a BSOD.  Once I removed the 2nd M.2 and put the Predator's M.2 back where it was...it was all good.  So it appears that you can not actually USE that 2nd M.2 drive despite it being empty and ready.  I hooked up a regular 2.5\" SSD in the empty 3.5\" bay and it worked fine, but not being able to install a 2nd M.2 SSD is points OFF for this laptop.  It's not a huge deal, and I will probably just install a 1TB SSD in the 3.5\" bay, but why make it look like you can install a 2nd M.2 if you really can't??  Also, WHY is the BIOS locked down?? I purchased this laptop as a replacement for my Acer E 15.  A serious upgrade indeed, and it was worth every penny (after the 4 year warranty and taxes, it was slightly north of $1300). BUILD QUALITY - Extremely solid.  Aluminum lid, plastic bezel that's thin around screen, but still very sturdy, aluminum keyboard frame, and then a plastic bottom.  Weighs in at around 5lbs.  Despite being a gaming laptop, the aesthetics are much more reserved than its 2018 predecessor.  A simple mat dark grey body with blue accents, light blue backlit keyboard (no RGB on this version), and a blue Predator logo on the lid that lights up. SCREEN - 1920x1080 screen, at 144hz.  If you have never seen games played at 144Hz, it is truly a thing of beauty.  Everything is just so buttery and smooth, it changes the entire dynamic of the games.  Now they could've combined this refresh rate with a higher resolution screen (such as 1440p), but there's no point when the screen you're looking at is on a 15\" laptop.  1080p is more than sufficient, and it really shines here. WEBCAM - 720p...not great..not terrible...better than nothing, but if you truly need something, use an external Logitech webcam. KEYBOARD - Standard chiclet style keys.  They feel good, especially if you like to type and you're used to smaller keys.  The num pad on the right forces things to be a bit condensed, but I'd rather have it than not.  The light blue backlight is nice; far easier on the eyes than red or green.  Again, no RGB on this model, but honestly..I don't miss it.  The keyboard has very little give when pressed down on, thanks to that aluminum body. Keys have a pretty good travel distance.  I bottom out my keys, and I still enjoy typing on this. TRACKPAD - Not sure what others are talking about; this trackpad isn't bad at all.  It's not super sensitive like the on my E 15, and it's pretty smooth.  It's not made of glass, but honestly it's fine. SPECS - Here's the rundown: - i7 9750H Intel chip (2.6Ghz, Turbo takes it up to 4.5Ghz).  It's a workhorse. - GTX 1660TI.  Yeah, the other model has a 2060 in it, but this card's performance isn't very far behind the 2060 at all, and it is far less power hungry, which equates to better temps and thus a prolonged life for the laptop overall.  Fair trade, if you ask me. - 16GB of DDR4 RAM.  This laptop supports up to 64GB, so if you plan on doing some 3D work or editing 4K video, you can upgrade the RAM yourself easily. - 256GB M.2 SSD for your OS.  There's an empty slot for another M.2 and even an empty 3.5\" bay for a 2.5\" SSD, and they include a bracket for installing it.  My Acer E 15 didn't come with one of those, so it's a nice touch here. - Also important to point out...the laptop comes undervolted out of the box at -.125, which definitely helps prevent heat throttling. PORTS - (Left side)  Kensington lock notch, fan exhaust, power adapter port, Ethernet port, and two USB 3.1 ports.  (Right side) Fan exhaust, HDMI port, Mini Display port,  another USB 3.1 port and a USB 3.1 type C port. BATTERY - 3720 mAh battery.  Normal web surfing will get you about 3-4 hours, but gaming is gonna be MUCH less...MAYBE an hour, especially if you're playing at max settings.  The power brick is a slim, so get used to carrying it around if you're on the go. SPEAKERS - Positioned on the bottom.  Nothing special.  I'd suggest headphones....and speaking of which... TURBO - Ups the ante on your device for more performance.  When pressed, the CPU and GPU both get a swift overclock, and the fans SCREAM to handle the extra heat.  No really..they're seriously LOUD..probably the loudest fans I've ever heard on a laptop.  This is good because it keeps the laptop cool, but I'd invest in some good noise-cancelling headphones. GAMES - It'll handle the latest modern titles without breaking a sweat on the highest graphical settings.  That's all you need to know.  I used Unigine to run a benchmark on it, and after pushing the unvolt to -.17, using the Turbo setting, and a cooling pad, the temps were below 60 degrees.  This will change depending on the title you play, how long you play, and whether you have a cooling pad or not. OVERALL - You will NOT find another gaming laptop at this price that performs this well and doesn't suffer heat throttling.  Acer has set the bar pretty high, and for only about $1200.  I'll continue testing and update this review with any new findings, but for now..I'd say buy with confidence for sure."}, {"name": "Dave", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "October 24, 2019", "title": "Phenomenal gaming laptop", "review_text": "I purchased this as a replacement for my Alienware 15R3 gaming laptop.

So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed. It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you. This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school.

The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..). Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery. 2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is. The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough. The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive. Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted. A couple of things that annoy me: -The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting... -The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off. -The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?"}, {"name": "H. C. L.

It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money. _____________________ This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain. I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly. What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there. On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything. Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it. After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.

Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks. The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor. The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop. This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop. Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect. Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing. Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem. The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price. I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need. The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured. This boots in about 15 seconds. It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with. This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING. I can't sing the praises of this enough. Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine. Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.

Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%. I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though. Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices. I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.

It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable. I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back. Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up. I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect. I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus! So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you!

Just needs a couple inexpensive upgrades", "review_text": "Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too. Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board). The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places. UPGRADES: I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow. I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with. Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode. Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer. Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.

The processing power is not very strong, so performance-wise, I was not impressed. But with the pricetag considered, I'm all right with this. However, the biggest thing for me is the OS- WINDOWS 10-IN S MODE. I had never heard of S Mode, and I didn't notice this when I bought the laptop. Apparently, S Mode is Microsoft's way of ensuring that you only use their apps and products by blocking you from downloading any outside apps. You have to get them all through their store. So, for example, were I to try to download Norton's anti-virus from Norton's official site, Microsoft's S Mode would tell me that I am unable. Any and all files outside of their store are blocked from being downloaded. In order to leave S Mode, you have to change it in the settings, but then you have to use a registration key for Windows 10 Home or Pro. So I shelled out another $130 just to get a fully functioning OS. Factor that price into this laptop price. THEN- after purchasing Windows 10 Home, I had to keep trying over the course of 4 days for the laptop to accept me switching out of S Mode because Microsoft was conveniently having server errors on their side and so my request could not be processed at this time. This is a common issue, at least from what I read among those discussing S Mode on Reddit forums. Multiple people report that Microsoft has server issues when you try to opt out of S Mode. Very very unhappy with this laptop for the sole reason that the OS is Windows 10 in S Mode. It was inconvenient and one of the most useless things I have ever seen pre-installed on a computer.

If you're a \"power user\", you're gonna wanna add another stick of RAM. I bought another 4gb RAM stick off an auction site for $15 shipped. -110gb of the 128gb is free to use out the box, that remaining 18gb is presumably a recovery partition for Windows.

Ok, this might be my only real complaint. I wasn't expecting the Trans-Siberian Orchestra to be embedded in this laptop, and I guess the provided speakers are better than reading lips, but you're better off using headphones 9.9/10 times. Everyone else already listed the pros ad nauseum, and they're not wrong. 1080p IPS display looks fantastic for a laptop, 128gb NVMe SSD is wicked fast, and there's a spot for a SATA 2.5\" drive if you want to add extra storage to the laptop. The integrated graphics chip is extremely impressive for the amount of power it draws, I would put its graphical prowess on par with the Xbox 360. For basic computing, this laptop is going to be more than enough. I tried to stress the laptop by playing some genuine 4k content off my hard drive (1:1 4k BDs), while having some Chrome tabs opened, and this laptop handled that like a champ.

I was just using it for browsing and video watching. It has only been a couple of days of use and this is already happening. Something is wrong with this but I am no techie so I don't know what. I did the usual troubleshooting...turn it off and on again. It didn't fix the problem. Beside this, the screen is really nice to look at. The bezels are thin which makes the viewing of shows wonderful. The screen is more matte than glassy which I find that I prefer compared to the glossy screen on my Asus (which performs way better than the Acer one without a question since mine is super expensive). The keyboard is easy to type and the layout of it is useful in that they had enough space to put a full number pad to the right.

The AMD Ryzen 3 3200U CPU packs a good amount of processing in its two cores and two threads per core. When I received my unit, I went through the Windows 10 mini setup.  The system ran fine in the provided Windows 10. I decided to install my operating system of choice which is Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS Desktop 64 bit edition.  In my experience, I found that the Acer Aspire 5 FLIES in Ubuntu or any Linux for that matter in comparison with Windows. Interestingly, I installed VirtualBox so that I could see how the Ryzen 3 3200U would handle virtualization. As it turns out, my Windows 10 virtual machine somehow ran even better than the shipped Windows 10. I also created virtual machines for Elementary OS and the new Linux Mint 19.2 beta. Both those VMs booted in seconds and performed well. If you plan on using virtual machines much with this laptop, I would add memory. The system comes with a single memory stick that is 4GB. There are two memory slots and if you have two matched memory sticks, they would takes advantage of dual channel memory access which might speed the system even more. In my tests, Libre Office writer and calc both launched from scratch in under 4 seconds. I installed both Firefox and Chrome on my Ubuntu and they are both very snappy. I used both the wired Ethernet and also the wireless card which I connected via 802.11ac and it performed very well. The only downside that I found with this system is the touch pad. The touch pad is very large and is impossible to avoid while typing on the keyboard and so I had a lot of typing corrupted by false hits on the touch pad. I finally turned the touch pad off via the Ubuntu mouse control panel and used an external mouse and the problem was solved. This is NOT a gaming machine by any means. It is an excellent machine for web surfing, document editing and email though. I found that the battery is good for almost 3 hours and charges very quickly.

Lightweight, Great Screen, Fair Battery, Easily Upgradeable!", "review_text": "Even at the non-Prime Day price, this laptop is still a solid contender in the \"budget\" arena of laptops.  My family purchased 3 and we are all quite happy with them.  It's lightweight, thin and comes packed with the essential features most non-gamers need to work and play.  Plus, it looks great! For the low price, you do give up a few premium features, such as a better CPU, USB-C ports, a large battery and lots of memory and storage.  However, the beautiful 1080p IPS screen, full keyboard layout, spaciousa and responsive touchpad, USB 3.1 ports and stereo speakers easily cover the basics and then some. Plus, memory and hard drive space can be easily upgraded for very little cost, making it possible to match the features of more expensive models without the price tag. The Ryzen 3 processor is plenty fast for most users and the onboard graphics are better than the graphics on Intel's competing i3 and i5 processors.  That said, this laptop does benefit greatly from a small memory upgrade for both speed and graphics performance.  Simply adding a second 4GB stick of DDR4 2400 or 2666 RAM to the free slot inside is all most users will need to get the most out of this laptop. If you plan on gaming heavily, you may want to look elsewhere, as that's not the strength of this particular model.  But, for basic photo/video editing and daily tasks like web browsing, spreadsheets and word processing, the Ryzen cpu with a low-cost 4GB memory upgrade is more than adequate. For users who need more internal storage, Acer has left a slot open inside the laptop which allows a 7mm thick 2.5\" SSD to be added at any time.  With prices falling on SSDs in the 256GB-512GB range, this is a welcome feature and a simple plug-n-play upgrade. Battery life is less than advertised.  Expect around 4 hours of continuous use, compared to the 7+ the manufacturer claims.  I'm assuming the battery can be upgraded to a better one at a later time, since it's easily accessible when the back cover is removed.  However, don't be put off when you find yourself plugging in for a recharge a little sooner than expected.  It's still \"average\" compared to most other laptops. Sound is decent, but not stellar.  Similarly, the trackpad feels a bit \"cheap\" when pressing at the edges, but it works very well and the response is really good overall. All in all, this is a great basic laptop out of the box and just a few dollars put into a couple small upgrades can really go a long way toward maximizing its performance and functionality.

For starters, some background context: I am in my mid-20s and have long since finished uni. I am not a gamer. I primarily use my laptop(s)/tablets for streaming shows/movies; occasionally working from home; and crafting/design editing. I used to go through every iteration of a MacBook but, while nice, soon found myself not really utilizing all of its features & could no longer justify its price-point (especially since I do still have an iPhone). This laptop is a STEAL for ~$300. I did my research and honestly, like a majority of the other reviews here said, the Acer Aspire 5 blows every other product in its price bracket out of the water. That said, I went into this fully knowing I wanted an inexpensive laptop and that, because of that constraint, whatever I ended up purchasing would most likely have some limitations. If you purchased this and are disappointed about the specs in correlation to it being ~$300.... I really don't know what to tell you other than that you definitely were looking in the wrong place. I solely bought this computer because I recently got a CRICUT Explore Air 2 and needed something compatible with it (Chromebooks won't work and my MacBook is so old it can barely handle the newest OS); however, I already know now that this is going to become my main laptop and I will get a lot of use from it outside of just crafting. THE IMPORTANT STUFF: 1.) This is a solidly-built laptop. Very sturdy, very lightweight. Perfect for on-the-go. It IS aluminum though the whole way around, so I recommend buying a case or sleeve to avoid scratching. 2.) The screen resolution and sound quality is surprising very good, crisp, and clean - while I think perhaps it could be a tad bit brighter, that's just me being nit-picky. I would still recommend using external speakers if you want to retain the quality of sound at its loudest setting, especially if what you listen to is bass-heavy. 3.) Turning off Windows S-Mode was absolutely painless - it's literally just going to the website that's taped on the outside of the box and clicking one or two buttons. 4.) Like other reviewers recommended, I did purchase another 8GB of RAM and installed it myself (I googled YouTube videos on how to do this for this specific laptop model; there are plenty of them, just take it slow and you'll be fine). I opted to leave IN the 4GB stick that was already there, thus giving myself a total of 12GB RAM. The difference in speed is HUGE and, like I said, I'm not using this for *too* much other than everyday use. Spend that little bit of extra money if you can, I promise it's worth it! I can't speak to anything as to whether it would hold-up with gaming, but definitely for a solid several hours of streaming content, crafting, and/or having multiple tabs & apps open simultaneously. 5.) The track-pad is VERY sensitive. Not so much so that I would take off a star, but enough to notice. I recommend purchasing a wireless mouse if you plan on doing more intricate work to eliminate any annoyance or mistakes. I bought one (a Logitech one, $10) and so far it's definitely made designing and editing much easier. It's been awhile since I've had a PC but it's nice to know that a lot of its shortcomings (such as memory space & speed) can easily be fixed and modified to your preference. Again, at the end of the day, this is NOT a heavyweight laptop, both literally and figuratively speaking, but that's okay because it's not meant to be! Overall, I would highly recommend this computer to anyone who is looking for an everyday laptop that is both budget-friendly without sacrificing too much of its quality."}, {"name": "Mark .

By that I mean, KEEP IT CLEANED! Acer, in its infinite wisdom, pre-installed a utility called ACER CARE CENTER. In this single utility you can defrag, clean out the junk, clean the disk, check health of battery, hard drive, etc. Use it! Some have complained their Acer is slow. Have you cleaned it? Expect to spend the first 3 or 4 hours just getting all the Windows 10 updates installed. After just that, I ran the Acer Care utility to find the hard drive was 28% fragmented, and disk needed to be cleaned. So, defragged and cleaned, then went on to add our many programs. When all done with everything, defragged and cleaned again. It boots up in 15 seconds. Battery life on any laptop is dependent upon the programs and use.

The NVMe SSD is very quick many of the low end laptops don't have this yet. 2 ram slots for dual channel many low ends only have 1. Cons: Ram runs at 2400 not 2666 don't believe the Acer reps here I have tested it myself with multiple sticks including the one that came with the laptop. Needs more ram for what I needed. If you just want to browse the internet and watch streams its ok. Keyboard back lighting looks bad some keys are much brighter then others I bothers me. No easy way to get to the ram battery or drives. Small SSD but I get what I pay for My goals are to be able to play some Classic World of Warcraft. Not raiding but auction house professions and a easy quest or two during down time at work. I must also be able to tab out quickly to my work spreadsheets and pricing sites. I know for sure the amount of ram would not do for what I wanted and would need to be upgraded and I had included this into my pricing thoughts. I went with 16gb ddr4 2666 cl15 for about $73. A little overkill but 8gb would be pushing it with all my work stuff needing to be open and ready at anytime and 2gb being reserved for graphics.  Being a Ryzen and integrated graphics it gets good use of the higher quality ram 2666 (15cl vs 18 or 19cl) so I splurged a extra $10 for. stock ram included was listed at 19cl for anyone that cares. I know classic wow is not a intense game but its really hard to find out how bad a laptop you can get and have it run bare minimum settings. I was looking at the E5-576G-5762 for about $599 and I would still want to up the ram in that but looking to save some money on a laptop I would only use twice a week really I decided to give this a try after much research. So for Team Fight Tactics I am getting 60 to 100 fps late game full teams can bring it down but its stays over 90 for the most part. Classic WoW I am currently playing with 1080p settings 3 (the classic like setting) getting from 60 to 120 fps while I can't test a raid yet I have only been able to use this for the stress test. moving up to settings 4 lowers the fps to 40 to 70 range.

I will say this again: Your performance will be LITERALLY cut in half without that $14 stick of RAM. Just get the stupid thing. Don't be a dipstick. Don't believe me? Look up the benchmarks for this laptop. The CPU cores communicate over the RAM and so do the APU cores. Slowing down traffic by half also slows down *EVERYTHING* by half because it's going to be the bottleneck once performance otherwise maxes out - and with 2 cores it will max out quickly with games. That said, the desktop isn't dead. If you're looking to run games primarily - or you at least know that that's something you want to do - and those games aren't last gen - I'd strongly recommend building a PC.

There were 2 slots for ddr4 sodimm ram, so I think you could potentially get 16GB total ram in this laptop if you had two 8GB sticks. When i had the laptop open, it APPEARED AS IF you could take out the 128GB PCIE NVME SSD that ships with the laptop and put in a larger one, so that's an idea. I mainly got this laptop to use to play everquest (a very old computer game), and do some light web browsing etc,  and have as a laptop that i can carry around without worrying about dropping a 4000$ laptop on the ground. It has an ethernet port, usb 3.1 ports, hdmi port, etc, so thats convenient compared to my macbook (which only has thunderbolt 3 ports and requires dongles or adapters for everything). The backlit keys are great and the keyboard feels good. If you dont like how the function key operates and you use the F1-F12 keys a lot, you can spam F2 while the computer is restarting and go into the BIOS and change the function key behavior. I am still getting a feel for the battery life so i cant comment too much on that, but the battery lasts a while and it seems to take about 2-3 hours to charge it empty to full. It ships with windows 10 S mode which sucks, you can go to the windows store and \"switch out\" of S mode for the regular windows 10 home operating system. Overall i am really loving this laptop, it was very affordable, easily upgradeable hard drive and memory, and it is working great."}, {"name": "Dennis Mcgrath", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "July 26, 2019", "title": "Great features for the price", "review_text": "First of all, the screen is gorgeous!!

Converting from Windows S mode to Home is also very easy. If you decide to order a second hard drive to upgrade it, be aware that you MUST order a drive that is 7mm thick. I originally ordered a 1 TB mechanical drive to install, based on an Amazon recommendation, and it was a 9.5mm drive. On the Acer website it clearly indicates that this laptop only supports 7mm secondary drives. I ended up installing a 7mm SSD and an additional 4GB of ram, and now it's blazing fast. I highly recommend this laptop. Update: Not as enthused as I was originally about this machine for these reasons: 1. Although it has a keypad on the keyboard, the system HOME, END, Page Up/down keys are tied to the keypad which means if you use the keypad on spreadsheets a lot, you can't jump around using Home and End keys - a real bummer if your job involves lots of spreadsheets like mine. IF I had known that I would have passed on this laptop. 2. I installed an extra 4 GB ram, but the system kept reporting only 5.9 GB Ram is usable. Defective Ram - I thought. Went ahead and slapped 16 GB Ram into it, but now using Speccy and Windows reopt only 13.9 GB is usable. Apparently, this is a known issue on Acer laptops with Ryzen and AMD graphics. The system seems to reserve 3 GB (give or take) for graphics and other stuff. To me, that's unacceptable and if I had known that I would have passed on it. IT is a nice machine. I like the build quality, the graphics are very good, etc. but this Ram issue is a bummer. If you are considering buying this machine, paste this into your Google machine: Aspire A515-43 usable ram less than installed - and see for yourself. It's a known issue and there isn't a real fix for it. Now I have extra memory I don't need adding another $30 to the price of this machine. Caveat Emptor leads to a 2 star deduction.

You probably won't be able to enable Legacy Boot, so discard that option if youtube and google told you to try that, unless your BIOS is somehow different from mine. You will need to: 1) Google how to make a bootable USB compatible with UEFI, then get your Linux ISO burned onto the USB. 2) Turn on your Acer and hit F2 right after the first splash screen to access the BIOS options 3) Setup a Supervisor Password (If you want it blank, I think it can be blank. Or make it something easy to remember and go back and change it to an empty field.) 4) Step 3 allows you to turn off Secure Boot. Look for it in the menus and do it. 5) Enable F12 boot menu (this allows you to select a USB to boot from). This is also in the menus. 6) Save changes and restart 7) Insert USB with bootable ISO 8) Restart, 9) hit F12 right after first splash screen, and you will have an option to select your USB to boot from. 10) Enjoy Linux. You can install, partition, or do whatever. I got Solus Linux running on it. Had some problems getting the latest Manjaro ISOs to fully boot. What you do from there is all up to you. I completely wiped Windows without ever booting into it once. If you are writing a review and you tried Linux, please put something about which Distro and steps you took and any problems you encountered, this helps all folks who want a better OS.

I pulled the HDMI and rebooted and it seemed to do the trick.

There is no other access panel to do this. While I had the back of the laptop off I also expanded the hard disk space with a Kingston 240 GB HDD since after Windows 10 updates there was only about 95GB of hard drive space left on the 128GB SSD. This laptop comes with 4 screws to attach the HDD to the bracket included on the motherboard. It also has the cable taped to the bottom of the back panel. So for about $60 more I added 8GB of RAM and 240GB more of hard disk space. It does have some bloat ware which I would recommend removing especially if you don't add a HDD.

Mostly Facebook and email. I immediately upgraded the RAM from 4GB to 16GB with memory I had on-hand, so my review is based on this initial upgrade. We've owned it for about 2 months now. Lets start off with what I like about this laptop. Keep in mind this is weighted by the low price point: - The display is solid, especially at this price point. Every other laptop in this range has a crappy old TN display. This is the real party piece of this laptop. - The aluminum top shell looks nice. - Processor seems adequate, or dare I say it, almost speedy - The SSD also performs well, even if it is on the small side. My wife doesn't store much on her laptop, so this is a non-issue for me. - Battery life is solid. 4 hours of continuous, medium duty use with no issues and 6-8 hours with lighter workloads. - Easy to upgrade. The RAM upgrade was a breeze, and there's even space inside for a 2.5\" SATA drive should you want to go that route instead of NVMe to upgrade storage. If you own an #1 Philips screwdriver and can remember righty-tighty lefty-loosey you should be good to go. This laptop isn't perfect (non of them are), so here's what I'm not crazy about: - The main body of the laptop isn't aluminum, it's plastic. This wouldn't be a big deal except for the fact that the plastic feels cheap. Really cheap. I'd go so far as to say flimsy. This doesn't inspire confidence that it will hold up for the long run, but so far so good. - Ditto on the track pad. It's worse than the track pad from the Chromebook this laptop replaced. - It's very hard to get the connector from the power adapter seated into the charging port. It almost feels like you are going to break something. It's gotten a little better with time though. Well, there it is. A decent performing laptop with questionable build quality. At this price point, that's kind of what I expected. Time will tell how it holds up, but so far, so good. If you have any illusions that this is going to be a budget gaming laptop, let me stop you right there. The processor and on-board video card are fine for normal, day to day tasks, but don't have any illusions about playing the latest video games at acceptable frame rates.

Yep, several restarts, updates, and other bologna and finally I was able to install the S Mode bypass so that I could download Chrome.  Then there's the bloatware.

What is most disgusting with this so-called \"new\" laptop from Acer is the 2nd hard drive slot is too small/too shallow to fit a laptop mechanical or Solid State hard drive in it at all and the contacts from the laptop to the 2nd hard drive do NOT meet up and thus.....you can NOT install the 2nd hard drive in this device. I had to use an external hard drive via one of few USB ports to put my music and some videos on since the built-in hard drive on this thing is 128 gbs. Also, I had to use another USB port for the external digital camera card reader I had to order as well. And of course, I use an external mouse meaning I used the third and final USB port on this laptop. Not sure why Acer, HP and other brands don't add 1 more USB port on lower priced laptops.....should not cost more just to add 1 more USB port....even if it's the slower USB 2.0 port. Lucky I gave this unit a 2 star....nearly gave it a 1 star. It will do okay for a laptop while traveling or for home use....if you don't view photos from any digital camera via the SD card reader...which this laptop does not have or loading software or Microsoft programs like MS Office....which mine came on CD disks and which this laptop lacks....a DVD/CD burner.

At minimum the memory should be upgraded to really make this a great machine, the cheapest upgrade is a single 4GB DDR4-2400 memory stick that would double the memory and enable dial channel operation for a nice performance boost. It works great with Linux as long as you stick with the latest kernels, the stock Debian/buster 4.19 kernel had some issues, but it works perfectly with the 5.2 kernel. Despite being a slim lightweight laptop with a large and bright screen, it is very easy to replace the memory and hard drive, unlike many recent premium laptops that are glued shut with non-removable components. The back cover can be easily removed to gain access to the memory and ssd. It comes with a 128GB NVMe x2 M.2 2280 WD SN520 SSD, that can be replaced with any 2280 NVMe ssd. Be aware though that only 2 PCIe lanes are connected, so any x4 ssd will run in x2 mode, limiting the bandwidth, but it's still much faster than SATA based SSDs. There are 2 DDR4 SODIMM slots, one occupied by the 4GB stick that comes with the machine, but can be removed to install a bigger stick. The processor supports DDR4-2400 speeds. I have installed 2x8GB memory, and based on the measured memory bandwidth I can confirm that it operates in dual-channel mode. The machine also has an empty slot for a 2.5\" drive, which is useful for those that need lots of cheap storage on board, but using that would reduce battery life. The processor is pretty fast, on par with Intel Core i3 netbooks, and the integrated  Radeon graphics easily beats the integrated graphics in Intel chips, especially with the upgraded dual channel memory, but obviously this is not a gaming laptop. Pros: Great price, upgradable memory (32GB should work), upgradable 2280 NVMe SSD, empty 2.5\" HDD slot, beautiful screen, gigabit RJ45 port, lightweight Cons: not so great battery life, no SD card reader, no USB-C port, cheap speakers, air intake at the bottom"}, {"name": "Maine Man", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "July 20, 2019", "title": "Better than expected", "review_text": "I joined the masses and ordered this laptop for it's \"potential\".

From start to finish, including updates, was less than 30 minutes.  Super quick boot time <10 sec to log in screen. You will want to update the graphics driver via device manager. The rest of the drivers were up to date. Sound quality was a concern. I went into the Realtek manager and switched from music mode to game mode and it made a big difference in the volume for me. Your mileage may vary. If you prop the front of the laptop up slightly, not covering the speakers, the quality improves also.

Otherwise for my intended purpose it was worth the price. As for the Windows S mode if you go into the windows store there is a free app that let's you switch out of it. You need a windows account to download and install it. Edit: I tried turning off the maximum memory option which limits the memory but it didn't work.

When coding, you frequently have to move the mouse to highlight specific pieces of text to do some sort of edit in your code. Unfortunately, the mousepad on this laptop is not accurate or precise, and when trying to make fine movements with the mousepad, the mouse moves in very, very small skips instead of a smooth, consistent glide. This makes it impossible to move the mouse quickly and precisely, because when trying to execute precise movements, you have to slow down and course correct several times when you get the mouse close to where you want it to go (instead of being able to quickly move the mouse to the precise location you intend). This lack of precision is very frustrating, and makes the user experience so slow that I am going to return it. I purchase laptops for at least 2 years of consistent use, and I just don't want to endure that kind of frustration every single day as I'm trying to give all of my attention towards building a technical skill. For those who appreciate speed and accuracy with the mousepad (just like with a mac laptop if you've ever used one - nothing too crazy, just very smooth and controllable motion that follows your input perfectly), I would advise you not to get this laptop, because I think you could be very frustrated with the user experience. As a final note, this laptop also had issues running Ubuntu 18.04 - whenever I closed the lid, the laptop would suspend (this is totally expected; \"suspend\" is just means \"sleep\" for linux), but whenever I reopened the lid, the laptop would not resume (turn back on) and I would have to force shut down and restart it (every single time). I could not find a solution to this issue after scouring the internet and trying a bunch of different fixes for about 4 or 5 hours. Some linux distributions have small issues with certain laptops, so for whatever reason Ubuntu 18.04 and this laptop just did not work well together. This issue was also frustrating and made for a very diminished user experience, although I may have been able to find another distribution that would have worked with this laptop. But for both of these reasons (very much mainly the first reason, the mousepad), I am returning this laptop. Don't want to deal with an issue like that for 2 years, rather just spend a little more money.

Add 4-8GB more of RAM and a 1TB hard drive (easy enough to do) and this laptop will give you just about all you need short of medium-hard gaming.  The keyboard is nice, screen is great, mouse pad OK, decent battery life, and it has most inputs/outputs you might need.  If you are looking to save some sheckles, this is the laptop for you. If you are undecided between the i3 or Ryzen chip, the extra $40ish dollars would be better spent on RAM or an internal hard drive.  The i3 might be a little better, but it won't be noticable.  The Ryzen with extra RAM will probably perform better than the i3 anyway. As far as Win 10 in S mode, I am happy that it is set up this way.  There was little to no bloatware on the laptop, and the apps you do not want/need are much easier to delete than removing programs.  Switching to normal Win 10 was simple, and I have about 95GB left on the M.2 NVME drive.  For those having problems switching out of S mode, the most common mistake is not validating your version of Win 10.

Normally, you have to hold \"Fn\" and hit an F key to use the function, but it was reversed on this machine. Also, the keyboard backlight turned itself off after 20 seconds of inactivity whether or not it was plugged in. It kind of defeats the purpose of a backlit keyboard, in my opinion, when you can't see the keys before you start typing. At any rate, both the F key and backlight issues were mostly fixed when I updated the BIOS directly from the Acer support site. I was then able to find settings for both in BIOS and disable automatic function key and backlight timeout. My only gripe is that there doesn't seem to be any way to keep the backlight on for more than 20 seconds when unplugged, no matter the power settings or BIOS configuration. Lots of Googling and worthless Acer chat support sessions later, I'm convinced there's no workaround. That issue aside, I can't really say anything else negative about this machine. At this price point, this is about as good as it gets. If you plan on doing anything other than browsing the internet and using Office, I do recommend purchasing an additional 4GB RAM stick and installing it yourself. It took me maybe 5 minutes with a YouTube tutorial video. Between that extra RAM and the stock SSD, I can run low-end games with Chrome and Skype running in the background all at once with no slowdown whatsoever.

Great value for money. If you're willing to deal with regular problems and that cheap pricepoint is all you're looking for, this is a good option. Pros: Backlit keys regularly turn off to save battery. Haven't found a setting to adjust this, but there's that. All keys have good travel, with a quiet clickiness. Quick activation, but they're thin enough that you won't notice it. Numpad is kinda small but it's also backlit and the layout isn't bad. Dysfunctional touchapad is big. 1080p. It's cheap, got this for $320. Cons: I'll list the cons from design flaws to potential model defects. First and most noticable is the misaligned trackpad, with it starting at the middle of the left alt key and ending at the spacebar. Not a major problem but it's left me often checking my thumbs. Right alt key is much smaller than the left. Webcam is pretty bad, so if you want to use it, you would be better off facetime or google hangouts. ok here's the glitches I've noticed as of opening up the laptop less than 6 hours ago. All keys are sticky and don't always activate. G and B have given me the most problems. I have to press hard to make them activate. The trackpad only works on the right side of the trackpad. There is no left clicking. Chrome is slow and glitchy, reminding me of pixel slate, not crashing but taking several seconds to scroll down or anything basic. The \"brightness down\" and \"brightness up\" buttons are reversed. Volume isn't though. Back to the touchpad because it's causing more problems!

The Toshiba one was starting to show its age by failing to pass POST and thus failing to boot. I had used it almost every single day since 2012 after all, as it was my college laptop and even helped me launch my career as an engineer, so it has served me well. But the OS failures were getting troublesome. They were happening increasingly often, so I decided before all my data was lost (which wasn't really that much, since I keep all my actually important data on a home file server), I decided to shop around for a nice, reliable, not-too-cheap laptop I could use to replace it, and this is the one I chose to buy. For the non-Linux enthusiasts, feel free to skip this paragraph, but a kernel panic is basically the Windows blue screen of death equivalent on Linux. My old Toshiba was having kernel panics all the time starting with Kernel 5, so I thought maybe it was my old hardware which has having trouble with the brand new kernel. I tried an LTS version of Kernel 4.19, thinking it was going to solve my kernel panic issue, but nope. I still had kernel panics all the time, and it was starting to get worrying how often it was happening (multiple times a day near the time I got this new Acer laptop). So I feel like I got the new Acer laptop just in time before the Toshiba hardware became unbootable. Now, I'm an electrical engineer, but I'm a lazy engineer. I didn't feel like dissecting the Toshiba to try and pinpoint what the problem might have been. I use Arch btw (best meme 2k19) So back to regular English. I'm thoroughly impressed with the hardware that AMD has developed with their Ryzen lineup and their Vega graphics. Sadly, with all the cryptocurrency mining happening nowadays, it's actually hard to find any AMD graphics card for use with actual graphics workloads like gaming. But that's beside the point. This Acer laptop, with its Ryzen 3 processor and built-in Vega Picasso graphics is almost overkill for what I use it for. I haven't tested any games on it, but I imagine it would run Minecraft well enough. Maybe not 60fps, but still enough to play. I use this laptop mainly for just web browsing, and occasional coding when I'm feeling ambitious with some sort of personal software project I want to work on. In the time that I used Windows 10 S Mode... it was just plain dumb. Not being able to install software from non-Microsoft sources? Really, Microsoft? What are you doing? You can easily opt out of the S Mode crap, but it warns you that you'll never be able to go back to S Mode in the future if you ever change your mind. Like that'll scare me into keeping S Mode! I'll show you how much I care about S Mode. I only spent about a half hour tinkering with it before I just blasted the whole NVMe M.2 drive clean and installed good old Arch Linux on it with a fully encrypted filesystem, so ain't nobody getting into my data. And I can say, this NVMe M.2 drive is freaking lightning quick. Compared to the old HDD on my Toshiba, this new laptop boots in like 15 seconds, if even that. My main PC with Godly specs (Intel i9-9900K + RTX2080Super + 1TB Samsung NVMe M.2) boots in around 10 seconds, so this little laptop is definitely keeping up with the speed. Overall, this Acer laptop is a fantastic computer; probably the best laptop I've ever owned at this price point. It's perfect for basic usage, and I recommend it to be used for light workloads like checking email, browsing social media, editing office documents, coding, and other basic tasks of the sort. The Ryzen + Vega chip will definitely last several years, and I'm happy to finally support a quality AMD product. Ultimately, it's up to you as the customer to decide if this is the right computer for your needs. Evaluate why you need this computer and determine whether or not the price of this laptop would best suit your needs. I needed something I could rely on with streaming, decoding, and rendering video data from YouTube, Twitch, and/or Netflix which is actually a bigger task than people give it credit for. If you don't intend to watch many videos or do anything more resource-intensive than that, then this laptop might be a touch too powerful for your needs. With all that in mind, it's safe for me to say that this Acer laptop is perfect for the moderately light workloads I intend to use it for."}, {"name": "Patrick in Memphis", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "November 13, 2019", "title": "Highly Recommended Laptop at a Good Price", "review_text": "I love the screen on this laptop.

Supposedly memory can be added easily - using YouTube university and a screwdriver. I find it very fast, the screen is crystal clear, and it has so far been able to handle any task I've thrown at it. I do not consider myself very computer literate, so another plus to this machine is that it's helped to push me out of my comfort zone and into understanding laptops better while I streamline startup and other functions, and understand workings through the limitations of the 'S' setup.

The pros are the Microsoft 10 S, the safe operating mode used in schools. It restricts your flexibility and internet use, which is a good thing for those with limited understanding of the dangers of the internet. Not having to worry as much as malware or viruses is a good thing. More on this below. The 4 GB of memory is low, but again - the price. Speaking of - the price, currently in the mid 300s, is fair for a laptop. The set-up is easy with the assistance of the onboard Cortana helper. Backlit keyboard is nice, too, although more about that, too. The sound is fair, the monitor is good, and the size, weight, and portability are solid. The cons are the memory, the restrictions inherent in S mode (which you can take off, but once gone, it's gone, which seems odd to me), the backlit keyboard which goes off after a few seconds...why?), the six hour battery, and the sound which is rarely good on a laptop no matter the price. On the whole, for the right user, this is an ideal laptop with a solid price. For simple computer basics (e-mail, basic internet searching), it will work well enough.

Without those upgrades it would probably be ok for office tasks and minimal web browsing.  For the price and even after upgrading the ram and hard drive I think it's well worth it for the money.  You can step up in price for the laptop but will not have that much ram.  The NVMe drive seems quick and now that I have the additional hard drive I don't have to worry about space.  The install of parts wasn't to bad.  Take out all the screws on the bottom, peal apart and install parts.  Separating the bottom was a little difficult, very well fit, so if you're hesitant in computer work, ask for help.  It took some finesse.  It almost feels like you'll break something so just go slow.  Back to the laptop. The screen is very good.  No problems with brightness and angles.  The speakers are ok, but then again this is a cheap laptop.  They're definitely better than some others I had but just keep a set of earbuds with it and you'll be fine.  Plus no one wants to listen to what you want, so just plug in for everyone's sake.  The battery life is ok.  I might be able to get about 6 hours out of it.  Haven't done a full test yet, only have used it for about 2 hours at a time.  Just over 2 hours of online use is dropping it to about 60%. The keyboard is pretty good.  Types pretty well.  The numpad is a little small but for the size of the laptop it's to be expected.  I would rather have it than not.  I do like the backlight.  Yes it times out after a couple of seconds.  But it does not turn off while you are using it.  It times out to conserve the battery.  I saw complaints about that but why would you want the backlight to stay on even when you're not tying?  Just doesn't make any sense.  I think it's fine.  Touchpad seems fine, but at this price point I didn't expect greatness.  I usually use a mouse anyway.

I also love the backlit keyboard. I use it a lot at night and it makes that a lot easier. My only two complaints are that the bottom left corner of the mousepad is a bit soft when left clicking on it and I pretty much always have to have the sound at full volume.

I originally was considering more expensive options, but I had tried his Chromebook for a couple hours (writing a paper using it) and I liked it too. I ordered a new one, and upon receiving it I plugged it into the charger for its first charge. The laptop seemed to work great in general when I started changing my settings and searching for websites.  However, the charger fit into the charging port very loosely, and when I moved the laptop on my lap it fell out easily. I figured I might have gotten a laptop with a faulty charging port and I returned it for a replacement. The second new Acer Chromebook R11 that Amazon sent me had a normal charging port. The charger fit well and did not fall out. But, the touchpad did not work. I tried to troubleshoot it and change touchpad settings, however every time I moved my fingers on the touch pad the cursor jumped around the screen. I ended up returning this one as well and choosing a more expensive laptop from a different company as I planned originally. My friend's Acer Chromebook R11 works fine and he has had it about 6 months. He was surprised that I had these troubles. I'm not sure what the quality control process is. It seems the experience with this laptop depends on whether one receives a fully functional one."}, {"name": "Nathan Enget", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "August 19, 2019", "title": "Exactly what I was wanting", "review_text": "My previous tablet was a nice inexpensive Win 10 with an attachable keyboard so I could use it like a mini PC. It was very nice, however quickly the battery became so weak it wouldn't last more than an hour. I needed something that would last all day, be lightweight, and still be used like a PC when I'm not at home. This is exactly what I was wanting! Even though it's a Chrome OS, all of the apps you get makes it feel like a PC. Use this as a laptop, then fold the keyboard backwards and use it as a tablet. The touch screen can also be used in laptop mode. It's all very responsive. The battery lasts ALL day! Depending on what you're doing with it and how you use it and for how long, you can make it last a few days before you have to recharge it. I usually am able to use it and charge it every third day or so. This is also able to load most all Google Play apps, just like your Android phone! Sync this up with your Google account and you can have all of your bookmarks and information from your Chrome internet browser that you use on your phone and your PC.

It is an amazing compromise. On a practical note: It MUST have WiFi to get to a function point.  Once loaded it operates well without it.

I am a PC/Windows user so moving to Chrome required a lot of learning/relearning.  Googling my questions and watching You Tube helped with the learning. I can do spreadsheets and word documents with some adjustments and downloading EXTENSIONS from the Chrome Webstore. I love the sturdiness of the laptop,  I love the long-lasting battery. The touchscreen is not perfect but functional. What I didn't know was that the Acer Chromebook cannot open password protected spreadsheets. This may be a deal breaker for some potential buyers.  I was not pleased but overcame it by  unprotecting my document. The second caveat is the PDF function. I was not able to edit PDF documents without downloading an extension which is not ideal. I also cannot apply a digitall signature on the PDF.  Have not found a solution yet. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.

Some of the features/main selling points for this laptop is the size (very portable and lightweight), touch screen ability, decent battery life, and decent touchpad/keyboard. Additionally, the bezel of this computer is definitely doable, compared to the other chromebook I had used. Overall, this chromebook is a great model to buy, especially for basic college/high school classes.
