I did not want to get the limited chrome books the school provides as I believe others may have a bigger need for the. I initially tried to use all the computers, tablets, etc... that we already have, but it does not work well. As such, I purchased this  laptop for my 4th grader (9 years old) because it does all that she needs, it is not too expensive and it is sturdy enough for a 9 year old to handle. I received it very well packed in foam. The packaged contained the laptop and the power supply. The laptop battery was already fully charged, which was nice... Setting it up took about 20 minutes (as expected) but it was easy. I already had MS accounts for my daughter, so that was a breeze. The version of Windows installed is not Windows 10. It is Windows in S. However, upgrading it to Windows 10 is a very simple task that takes a reboot (which is what I have done). The keyboard is big enough to ensure you do not need a secondary (external) keyboard. The mouse pad is sensitive, and has the 2 clicking pads for the left and right clicks. There are plenty of  USB ports, HDMI and more. The battery lasts an easy 4 hours (37% left after 4 hours - not using maximum brightness in the screen). The camera has a good resolution for use with Zoom or MS Teams. I would not use this for me professionally, but it is a great laptop for a young kid in school (homework) or to play with Roblox...

I bought 3 of these HP stream: one from amazon.com and the other two from the Microsoft store. I decided to outfit my grade 3 classroom with inexpensive computers. In-class use: Although I used it sparingly over the past few months, students were able to engage in web-based activities. Over time I had to remove S-mode to install chrome browser because I needed access to certain chrome based store apps. Coronavirus use: I prepared the HP Streams by installing zoom, and Microsoft Teams, then I loaned them to students without devices. These computers were a disaster. The complaints were, their sluggish response, over zoom, they suffered from inconsistent wi-fi connectivity; Zoom meeting app, kept  freezing, etc.  I have decided to give them away as donations, and look for devices that are useable.

I'm very knowledgeable about computers and how to optimize them, but despite my efforts, there isn't enough free space on the computer for it to update Windows. The screen is quite poor. It's only 11.6\" and that means it displays just a small amount of info at a time. And it's a TN - meaning the viewing angles are very restricted. The CPU is weak. The hard drive is an \"eMMC\", meaning it's very slow. So I would definitely not recommend this computer.

The battery life lasts a few hours on a full charge (about 5 hours, if I remember correctly) and the setup was fairly easy. This product does come with that S mode on it, but it was easily removed (a web window popped up on the website and allowed me to change it within a few seconds).

Only have used it a few times because I\u2019m not a fan of using this for a constant touchscreen use. Just not my style, but it does work very nice. -Speakers/sound is very nice -Downloads are super fast -Easy to use and set up Cons: -Says it comes with a 125 GB of storage on it, in reality it\u2019s more like 70 GB. However, easy fix is to but an external drive. I use a Toshiba 2 TB external drive (around $60 on here and works amazingly) and use it has an extension of the laptop, problem solved. -when you unplug the charger the screen dims making it hard to edit photos or do any photoshop work. -Does not play highly detailed games well, it lags. All in all, I highly recommend this laptop to almost anyone. If you are a basic gamer this works very nice, but if you are more advanced in gaming, don\u2019t get this. If your games are very detailed or take up a lot of storage, this will not work for you. It will lag (if you\u2019re lucky to have the space to install). But if you like Sims, Minecraft, Roblox...you\u2019re all set. Same goes for if you do any photo editing or any digital illustration work. Pretty much any Adobe program works flawlessly on this."}, {"name": "Kenneth Keener", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2020", "title": "Great device but takes some getting used to!", "review_text": "I am pleased in general with this device.

Unfortunately, I had to return mine.  The display is a nice full HD 1920 x 1080 with bright crisp color.  The keyboard is excellent. The trackpad is large and responsive.  Browsing the web is very quick.  I benchmarked this machine with Octane 2 and got a score of around 12000.  Not bad for a Celeron.  So... why did I send it back.  The problem was that the Chromebook I received had two manufacturing flaws.  The case is aluminum which is great, but the bottom edge of my case had a sharp edge going all way around.  I think the aluminum case was a fraction of a millimeter too wide.  It wasn't sharp enough to cut, but it gave the Chromebook an unfinished feel.  The second problem was that the trackpad was loose.  It worked fine, but when you tapped (which you do a lot on Chromebooks), the trackpad rattled slightly.  I thought I could live with it, but the more I used it, the more crazy it made me.

Will give update after using Acer 514 Chromebook for several months. Update: One month into using Acer 514. I am very pleased with this chromebook. It is fast and battery life is 11.5 hrs up to 12 hrs. The Gorilla Glass Trackpad is responsive and smooth. I like the 'night light mode' that I have automatically set up, it really reduces glare and strain on the eyes at night. Took a little time to get used to Chrome OS system; but I will NEVER go back to Windows again. The Touch Screen is also smooth. Over all, for my first Chromebook , I am completely satisfied.

After another year of unreliable performance I purchased an Asus c434 Flip, only to return it shortly afterwards as it was clearly defective, with flashing screens, etc. Then based on the reviews I purchased this Acer. I quickly found it problematic but foolishly didn't return it as well. So now, four months in, the greatest problems are the touchscreen and the quality of the chassis. About once each day the screen freezes and loses all responsivity to touch, requiring a hard reboot. Sometimes when I simply pick up the device the screen alters it place requiring scrolling up or down to return to where I was, but worse than this it often just closes out the current screen and takes me back a tab or two. This happens with holding/touching the frame around the screen or its back, as well as the chassis around the keyboard. Pressure to the area adjacent to the touchpad is especially likely to cancel the current tab, sometimes throwing me back to the home screen. If I didn't know the sequence to restore tabs (ctrl+shift+t) I'd have tossed this thing in the garbage weeks ago. This Acer has turned out to be a 400 bucks piece of crap. I LOVE the Chromebook platform and I'll never go back to Windows, but if the only way to get a user friendly reliable laptop I may have to forego the touchscreen and cough up the $$$ for an Apple. Update eight months after purchase: now it randomly freezes when I have too many windows open. Can I close those excess windows by using the touch screen? No I can't. If I had a dollar for every time I've had to shut down and reboot I'd have recouped more than the $$ I paid for this thing."}, {"name": "Abbie Wilkes", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2019", "title": "Everything you need a great workhorse Chromebook", "review_text": "An amazing Chromebook!

There's conflicting information from the representative and the photos/specs provided so this is the specs as it sits in my hands. Specs: All plastic shell IdeaPad 3 14ADA05 81W0003QUS Ryzen 5 3500u 3 USB-A ports, 1 USB 2.0 and 2 USB 3.0, there is no USB-C on this device. Do not use the answer from the representative as correct on this one. I even asked a more clarifying question and was told there is a USB-C, but you cannot charge over it. The screen is a 1920x1080 TN panel, no touch screen 256GB NVME drive - no spinning HDD, so disregard the section that says 7200rpm on the description page 8gb of DDR4 ram at 2400mhz 3 cell battery - seems okay power saving options gives it roughly 8hrs depending on what you're doing and your tolerable screen brightness (but your mileage may vary) There is no back lit keyboard. The keys feel textured and not smooth like some other laptops which, personally I prefer it. Review: This appears to be Lenovo's answer to the mid-grade $400-$600 laptop shortage. If I had to guess it seems like this is in the chaise of the S145 with a 3500u APU. Compared to my wife's Lenovo IdeaPad FLEX-14API with the same processor, ram, and SSD - performance wise it matches, but that's not the end of it. Her computer has what feels to be an all metal design, the ability to flip into a tablet, backlit keyboard, touchscreen, and a much better IPS display (still 1920x1080) with better viewing angles. We purchased this for her last July, 2019 and the difference of final price was ~$75 higher. At the time of writing this the same laptop goes for $750 on Amazon for the \"New\" model and $699 for a used model. Conclusion: If you need a sub $500 laptop right now, this is a solid purchase as long as you know what you're getting. If on the other hand you have the luxury of waiting a few months I would wait. If the prices/stock stabilize you can get much more bang for your buck for nearly the same amount of money. More laptops with the Ryzen 5 4500u is going to be coming out over the summer with 20% more power and it's suppose to come in at a similar price point. Even if they come at a higher price point it will drive the price of the 3500u down."}, {"name": "Milton", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2020", "title": "Great laptop/pc", "review_text": "It's great and it's very reliable it charges so fast!and its amazing!"}, {"name": "Russell Auwae", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2020", "title": "Still worth it", "review_text": "As stated in another review, Lenovo needs to make corrections to the product description.

The \"label\" that needs to be removed is much like a Lottery Scratch off. I used an X-acto knife and carefully scratched  just the top layer off of the label. If you peel too much, you will be calling Microsoft for assistance. When I get a new machine on work on, I use a direct connection to my router for speed. Once I have done all of the updates for Windows, I disconnect the network cable and go wireless. That went perfectly.

Not a whole lot of information about this model on the internet, but I was curious myself to try out the new Ryzens and Vega chips. It\u2019s does just about everything a normal person would want a computer to do. Getting it out of S mode is literally a flick of a switch. Comes loaded with the normal crapware you expect from an off the shelf computer. It DOES have an unoccupied RAM slot, which I filled with an 8gig stick. What\u2019s curious, is it looks like there\u2019s an empty 2.5 inch bay, which I was going to fill with an SSD, however it doesn\u2019t have SATA cabling or connectors to hook it up. For reference, to get to the main board, you\u2019re going to have to peel off the sticky feet on the underside of the body. Despite my specific gripes, for $350 it\u2019s an excellent value and looks and feels like what I remember $700 laptops running like five years ago.

I immediately tried to solve the problem myself (looked into driver, adjust settings, etc), but none of it worked. I called Asurion with my protection plan and a technician kindly diagnosed the problem. It turns out that when this computer is plugged in to the AC adapter and charging, the current causes the mouse to jump all around if you use the touchpad. The second you unplug it, it works fine. I had purchased this computer for my children to \"go to school\" with. And while it does work fine when not plugged in, what do we do when we need to both use the computer and charge it at the same time? That seems like a pretty major glitch for a brand new computer.

Nonetheless, the fan comes on periodically, as needed.  I'm expecting a new WiFi 6 router to arrive in 5-7 days.  I could only imagine the speed of my download streaming.

It was a great Dell laptop and cost half the price, but I figured it'd be worth it. I only use my laptop to watch youtube/netflix, and just browse the web. So I figured at $600 this would be more than enough, but it's been more of a hastle. Firstly, the fan is pretty loud, and randomly revs up pretty significantly when I'm doing nothing more than watching a youtube video and scrolling thru reddit. It sounds like it's powering a small generator, and after awhile I have to shut if off because I'm afraid it'll over-heat. Secondly, for no reason at all, it randomly restarts itself. In the weeks I've had it, its done this half a dozen times. No warning, no error message before OR after. The screen just goes black, restarts itself, and you're back at the startup screen, whatever you were doing now gone. It just did this now, which prompted me to write this review. With everything going on, it's almost impossible to find another laptop without having to search for EXACTLY what you need, then wait for it to ship and HOPE its what you need. Too complicated to return, and not worth \"repairing\", I'm stuck with this $600 placeholder.

Here\u2019s my buying experience: Shipping was very quick arriving a day before scheduled. Box is a standard brown box with an HP logo on the side. Comes with a relatively long charging cable, setup pamphlet, and the laptop as listed. Setup was easy. Windows 10 walks you through step by step. The screen has good color for the price and the edges are thin. It\u2019s not a touchscreen which I personally love. Speakers are better than my previous laptop. Comes with a good quality webcam. I\u2019ve been using zoom to conference and the microphone picks up my voice from anywhere in the room. Outside of work, my son has been using it for online gaming. Only complaint is the fan gets a bit loud under heavy use. The positive, it stays cool and powers through whatever I throw at it.

It has so much bloatware installed that the computer runs extremely slow. (I am talking turtle slow, go get a cup of coffee, make breakfast, and come back to find the computer is still thinking about doing what you are asking it to). Even just simple web surfing is annoyingly slow. There are two choices: either upgrade the ram to 8 gigs OR install a clean copy of Windows 10. You cannot uninstall the bloatware as it has been integrated into the installed Windows 10 operating system. These are your only two options with this laptop. Once I realized that I could not uninstall the annoying bloatware, I decided to completely format the hard drive and install a clean copy of Windows 10. Luckily I already had a copy of windows 10 so I didn't incur any additional costs. If you don't have a copy of windows 10 and don't want to purchase one, then your remaining option will be to upgrade the ram to 8 gigs. If you can do this yourself, it will cost about $40. If you take it somewhere for this to be done, you should plan on spending around $100-ish.

For starters, it takes less than 5 minutes to change it from Windows 10s mode to normal (You're even given a prompt as soon as the initial setup is complete), otherwise it's just a 10 second google search. For the specs, it can run any simple task like YouTube, email, word, etc. with ease. The system also comes with an SSD rather than a disk hard drive, making boot up much quicker. There are a few cons that do prevent it from being a 5 star product however. First, the battery life is relatively low, only getting around 2-3 hours doing light-medium work, so if you're going anywhere, make sure to bring the charger. Second, the mouse-pad is off center, which is bad for lefties like me (you're gonna have to buy a mouse or get used to the awkward positioning). Lastly, there is significant bloatware issues upon setup (McAfee, Lenovo apps, a billion Microsoft apps, etc.) making the computer slow at first, but once everything is uninstalled, it runs much smoother. Overall, it isn't a bad system at all. Many of the issues can be rectified with little to no money, and for it's price, I would definitely recommend it to people who want a college/business/recreational laptop, but do not want to break the bank. (note: for gaming, it can run simple games like minecraft, Roblox, LoL at 35-45 fps med-high settings. For more demanding titles, it is powerful enough to run a peer to peer gaming software like Parsec)"}, {"name": "Amazon Customer", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2019", "title": "Lenovo laptop bad laptop", "review_text": "I bought this item lenovo laptop on Jun 17, 2019, thelaptop will not turn on  a few months after that On Aufust 26, 2019, still covered under manufacturer warranty, the question is where do I send the laptop to get fixed?

Now we come to this AWFUL Windows 10 S mode. For those not familiar with S Mode: some new computers (including this one!) boot to S Mode when you turn them on for the first time. In Windows 10 S mode you cannot uninstall  anything from your new computer and you CANNOT install anything not made or pushed by Microsoft. Lets say you want to install you favorite web  browser. Not so fast! Windows in S Mode will tell you that you already have a wonderful Edge browser and will not let you install one of your choice. Most people do not like this S Mode and Microsoft says \"OK, switch to regular Windows 10.\" To do this just click here, then here and then here and that's it. Well, it took me half a day clicking \"here and here.\" I followed Microsoft instructions to the letter, but my new laptop stayed in S Mode. Then after probably 25 tries, it suddenly worked and it booted into normal, regular Windows 10 and it's fine now. So, you might be lucky and your new laptop will switch from S Mode to regular Windows right away, or you might have to fight with it, or maybe you'll like S Mode (I cannot imagine who would like it...)

My only complaint is the screen. I knew it wouldn't be amazing since it wasn't full HD- so this was not a surprise to me.

I reached out twice via the online chat during that time, and both times was told they had no updates to provide me.  I finally received an email that my computer was \"damaged\" and not covered by warranty and would cost $246.00 to repair (it cost $256 originally).  I was told that I had 10 days to pay or my computer would be returned to me (despite me waiting 2 weeks to hear anything).  I again called the direct phone that was included in my email, and had to leave 3 more messages before anyone called me back.  I was told that it was not covered because they felt \"I must have not taken care of my computer.\"  Somehow, having a computer on your desk and when you pull the plug out and it falls apart that was my fault and not a manufacturing issue.

Still, this laptop is awesome!! Rating: 5 Stars (because 4.8 isn't an option and 4 is too few for this thing) Model: 12 GB RAM; Ryzen 5 3500U Pros: > That price! (Unmatched in performance in this price range!) > Ryzen 5 3500U performs better than the Intel Core i5-8250U. > Vega 8 graphics are fairly capable. > Backlit keyboard is nice and a pleasure to type on > Light and portable > Great port selection. > 12 GB of RAM is sufficient for most daily tasks. (Expandable to 20 GB if your the warranty voiding type) > Decent sound for its class > Comes with a pen that works very well with the software > Great touchscreen Cons: > Can't charge via USB-C (Lenovo! Please do this for the next model!!) > Screen brightness is sufficient, but not suitable for outdoor use. > Pen stores very awkwardly (Lenovo! You can really do better!) > McAfee preinstalled, and it resists being uninstalled. (You actually need to download their uninstaller to do it. IMHO its more of a virus than an antivirus.) > Battery life is definitely OK. Its not a super long lasting battery but I seem to get 5 hours out of it at a time (in balanced mode and dimming the brightness a bit - honestly, you get what you pay for. My take: I bought this laptop for graduate school. I wanted something I could use to take written notes as well as use to do all my assignments. It needed to be portable, fairly lightweight, all while not compromising on performance. This laptop fit my needs on paper. Now, after using it (practically daily) for a month, I can say its a pleasure to use. It boots up in seconds (like less than 20), and has a lightning fast fingerprint sensor. My other laptop is a Thinkpad X1 Extreme, which I intended to be a powerhouse (32 GB RAM, i7-8850H, 4K, GTX-1080Ti Max-Q). Honestly, this laptop puts my \"powerhouse\" to shame in many ways. The Flex 14 boots up QUICKER, has less graphical errors when switching between desktops, and has a brighter back-light on its keyboard. Of course the Flex 14 can't run a virtual lab environment comprising of 4 machines like my Thinkpad Extreme, but it sure can run 2 VMs simultaneously (at least on the 12 GB RAM config). This laptop is SO good for the price I'm honestly shocked that it is not listed in the best laptops of 2019 list on YouTube or Google - its really a great find. Thank you Amazon! TLDR: This laptop is amazing. If you're a student, someone who seeks a 2 in 1 experience, a person who doesn't want to pay $800+ for a laptop and needs something portable yet powerful enough to get actual work done, this is the laptop for you."}, {"name": "Atarkiss", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2019", "title": "Refurbished", "review_text": "I received this computer on Thursday, marked brand new. 20 minutes after setting up part of my screen glitched up and became pixelated.

The material is mostly plastic but I appreciate that for the reduced weight. This is my first Ryzen machine, and I am mainly using it to run a Citrix environment (cloud-based VM). Today will be the first full 8+-hour day using it. The power brick is not excessively huge. About the width and height of a standard post-it note, and 1\" thick. The cable is over 5' (my measuring tape only goes to 60\") closer to 6'. It has a barrel connector so unfortunately, it is not easily replaceable with a USB C cable (next model, pretty please?) The keyboard is backlit, which is nice for the darker surrounding often found in my home office. Typing is okay, but there is a noticeably shorter key travel than other laptops/Chromebooks I have used. I'm getting used to it, but like with any new keyboard, there will be a small learning curve. I keep missing the home row and using the Caps Lock as the A key for some reason. I'm using it on a small folding table at the moment so that could be the reason. The screen is nice, it is a 16:9 full HD screen, and for me, I prefer 16:9 to the new standard of 2:3 (more of a square). It is not bright though. Not at all. Even with the curtains open, there are times when I am still trying to get more brightness out of this display. It's not unusable, but forget trying to use it outdoors. Touch is fine and works. I did not buy this to use as a tablet though but Windows 10 has some processing going on in the background that makes it easy to hit small buttons in applications without being terribly accurate. The pen is interesting to me as it is roughly the size of a real pen [*cough* Samsung*cough*] which makes it easier to draw/write with without immediately cramping my hand. The Dolby Audio on the speakers leaves a lot to be desired. Some tweaking was needed to get the overblown sounds to subside. During the initial setup, it was hard to listen to. Turning Dolby Audio off though somehow reduces the speaker volume by 2/3... Not the actual volume percentage, but the actual sound. Dolby is using some sort of gain control so 20% volume sounds more like 40%. 4k video on YouTube looks great and only dropped 3 frames in a 2:44 video (Borderlands 3 FLAK FTW!) but that could have been from me trying to make it full-screen.  I have not tried any games yet, but I did install Diablo 3, and World of Warcraft Classic. If anyone is interested, I will update this when I try them. With the Vega graphics, there is an automatic 2GB reduction in RAM availability. Couple this with the 8GB model and you are left with 6GB to run Windows 10 and any applications. Budget for the 12 GB model unless you are A) skilled with laptop hardware, and B) don\u2019t care about the warranty. I\u2019ve seen the tear-downs, and there is an open RAM slot. I usually don\u2019t tear open electronics until a year after I own it (unless there is a reason to do so). The WiFi issue that is detailed on the 8GB model is non-existent for me. I feel like I may be more qualified to test that as Citrix requires a constant network connection and gives an immediate alert if connectivity drops for more than a couple seconds. No issues here, running the latest Windows updates. Overall I\u2019m happy with this laptop, It is much lighter than my 15\u201d Acer Predator and looks a lot more professional when traveling for work."}, {"name": "myReviews", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2019", "title": "Engineers should be ashamed of this device.

Pros: -Uses SSD, so it's fast. -Hinge is pretty sturdy after a few days. -Good keyboard layout. Cons: -WORST PEN AND PEN HOLDER IN HUMAN HISTORY. I can't get over how stupid this thing is. The holder is the worst: it takes away one of 2 full-sized USB ports itself, but if you want the pen to stay in the pen holder, you have to go horizontal which blocks both USB-A ports and the pathetic SD slot. Pen eats AAA batteries; why is it not rechargeable? It's supposed to be able to be stored vertically but the hole where the pen tip is supposed to rest and fit the pen tip in for stabilization is too far down and the pen just pops out. The pen is accurate but of the two buttons it has, only one seems to work (the right click). The other one seems to be there for decoration or confusing people. Absolute garbage. -SD card sticks so, so far out of the SD card slot: it's around 60-70% exposed. You will snap one of those eventually if you aren't super careful. I haven't, but I've only had it a few days. Why even have it if you can't even make sure the card isn't somewhat protected? -SSD is small.

Please **** yourselves for putting that in there. -Awful documentation. I had to go to the Device Manager to identify the NIC. Their own website doesn't even list it on the \"full\" spec sheet. -It didn't even run Netflix in Edge. It's a Windows machine that can't even do Netflix out-of-the-box. -I couldn't even install Linux Mint or Debian on it because it couldn't identify the Realtek NIC.

Nearly any laptop can do that, but this one does it quite well for the price. I was looking for a laptop similar to the Surface Pro, or Surface Go. With the necessary accessories (i.e. pen and keyboard) both Surface products cost well over the price tag of this laptop, and even come with lesser specs. This CPU (Ryzen 3500U) is incredible for what I need this laptop for. As an engineering student, I'm certain it could handle programs like MATLAB, SolidWorks, and AutoDesk products.  Vega 8 graphics are good for regular use, but I wouldn't use it for gaming as I wouldn't want to max the thermals out, but Minecraft and Rocket League would run on low-medium if you absolutely need to. The laptop comes with a pen and USB holder for the pen, and the pen works great. It allows me to use my laptop as my notebook for all classes. Maybe this laptop is for you, and maybe you need something more higher end. PROS: -Sharp 14\" 1080p screen with great colors and great pen accuracy -Battery life easily lasts me 7 hours of use and the charger is very portable. -Slim, light form factor -Very fast, but it is new so I would expect that since it has an SSD. CONS: -Get the higher RAM model, the embedded graphics uses 2 GB of whatever RAM you selected and 6 GB is not enough for school use, 10 GB is though. -Keyboard has a very short travel, takes a while to get used to -Touch pad is mediocre -Pen sometimes has issues with the barrel buttons, very minor gripe. -Build quality is okay at best. Lots of plastic, some flex on the chassis and keyboard, but again, it's relatively cheap. No idea about the longevity of this laptop, but I guess I'll find out in the future. Mine shipped with a year and a half warranty so that is nice.  All-in-all, if you're on a tight budget, this laptop (Ryzen 5 3500U and 12 GB ram) will work great for school.

Time of ownership is only 2 days, so I can't speak to long-term reliability. Build quality appears to be good. Performance: No complaints. Handles light multitasking without stuttering. Haven't performed any heavy productivity tasks, but I expect it would do well. Specs are as advertised. SSD is a TLC Western Digial PCIex4 NVMe M.2 drive with respectable performance (see pics with 3GB/1.6GB read/write speed). Everything appears to be new, as it had zero 'on' hours before I started using it. RAM is dual channel, even though it is an non power-of-two configuration. This helps with GPU performance. I played a demo for Forza Horizon 4 at lowish settings and fairly smooth gameplay (30 FPS). Screen: Touch screen works very well. I got a screen protector and applied it immediately, thinking that the screen would come dust-free from the factory. This was not the case - make sure you wipe down the screen, even if it is brand new! My son enjoys using the pen to doodle, and I anticipate using it for annotating documents used for teaching. Screen is bright enough for me. Battery: I suspect that some of the complaints about the battery may have been from users getting the Windows 'estimate' of battery length during periods of heavy processor usage in the first couple hours of Windows updates, etc. After all Windows updates and installations have completed, with normal web browsing and settings optimized for battery life, Windows is telling me I have roughly 14 hours (see attached pic). With battery settings at top performance and screen at full brightness, it is reduced drastically to ~5 hours, as expected. Sound: Sound quality is adequate. Not impressive, but it gets the job done. Misc. I noticed that my WiFi speed was capped at around 10Mbps, but only while I was on batter power. I changed a setting on the WiFi adapter power management (see attached pic), and the problem disappeared. I have had no problems with WiFi disconnects. Lenovo Vantage has a setting to limit battery charge level to ~60% in order to improve battery longevity - I like this! It is easy enough to disable if I am going on a road trip and need the full battery length. Keyboard is adequate. I enjoy the backlight and have no worries about it breaking, but it does feel a little cramped. Fingerprint reader works well. Camera image quality is sufficient for video chats.

Light photo retouching in Affinity handled with ease. Editing 1080 video files in Hitfilm, yeah it can handle that. Rendering them isn't the fastest out there, but it gets the job done without slogging the entire system down. And gaming, while it may not look the best in some titles, is surprisingly passable with the help of the Vega graphics. I was able to get a modestly sized city built in Cities: Skylines (a very CPU/RAM heavy game) and still able to run a few tasks in the background. If it can handle all this, your average user will be able to run this without issue. The screen is more than capable enough for some light work in photo editing, but since it doesn't have any claims on sRGB coverage you probably don't want to do any professional work on it. The touchpad, while being a bit on the small size, is usable and accurate. Keyboard is pretty good for a laptop. Body is solid, no flex when resting my wrists on it while typing. The fans stay quiet most of the time, and even when they do ramp up it's not the worst noise I've heard. Almost no wobble on the keycaps and the keys have a pretty satisfying feel when activated. The fingerprint reader with Windows Hello works flawlessy and quickly. And the pen and touchscreen are decent enough for me, but I'm no professional artist, I just like to doodle and play a game of Drawception every now and then. There are a few things that keep this from being 5 stars, though. The battery life is serviceable enough that I can occassionaly pull it out and work on something without fearing it dying, but in my use I'm pretty far from that claimed 'Up to 10 Hours'. Speakers, are not great. Turning off the Dolby 'enhancements' made it sound okay for the most part, but sound does get distorted at higher volumes. You'll be better off with external speakers or headphones. The pen holder, while I do appreciate Lenovo trying to include one, is laughable. With the pen inserted in it, all ports, as well as the power button, on the right side are blocked. And while the screen stays put while typing, it wobbles considerably when using the touchscreen or drawing with the pen- unless you use it in tent or tablet mode with the screen flat against the bottom of the laptop. The last minor gripe is storage space. 250GB isn't a lot. But since the m.2 SSD is pretty easily upgradeable, and there is a 3.1 USB-C jack that is just begging for an external SSD to be plugged into it, this isn't that big of an issue. But don't let that scare you away. Lenovo has pieced together a very compelling device here with many use cases, at a bargain price. With some upgrades down the road and the proper care, you'll get a good life span out of this device."}, {"name": "Amazon Customer", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2019", "title": "great value !", "review_text": "version: ryzen 5/vega 8, 12 GB RAM, 256 GB NVME SSD had this thing for a week now and i'm pretty impressed so far. My main gripes are with the battery life.  maybe it's the way i use my computer (lot's of video, adequate screen brightness) and the [small] size of the battery cause i can't seem to be able to use this thing for more than 3.5 to 4 hours without needing to plug it in again. I'm more accustomed to this because I've been using laptops with crappy battery life for the past 10+ years but I was hoping for a noticeable improvement with this new machine. Also, the way the speakers are situated ( below the base of the machine and towards the back)  the sound can be muffled sounding when you're holding it in your lap.  When sitting on a desk, this isn't so much of a problem. In addition, because of the mostly plastic construction, the speakers rattle bit (more noticeable at higher volumes).  Otherwise the sound is pretty clear, in stereo, and nicely augmented with Dolby software. Other reviewers have has trouble with the wifi cutting out but I haven't had that issue.  Once you get your computer, be sure to update your windows software to the latest version, then use the levono vantage software to do a check on your machine to see what else you need to update (bios software, graphics card drivers, etc).  Hopefully you can avoid those wifi connection issues by first following those steps. I imagined this computer working like a super tablet and that it does this very very well.  it's really really zippy while using day to day programs (word processor, photoshop, web browsing) and regular windows 10 navigating.  Folding the machine to it's different configurations is a lot of fun and windows adjusts to the different interaction styles automatically. 256 GB of hard drive space is tiny by today's standards, there isn't an easy way to upgrade, and only one slot for a hard drive on the motherboard. tinkering with the insides voids the warranty and lenovo reps are quick to tell you that the machine can't be upgraded by the user.  there are two RAM slots and only one is upgradable  (one 4 GB ram card is soldered onto the motherboard.  all this being said the NVME SSD makes the machine as speedy as it can be.  my suggestion is to just keep the essentials on the laptop's hard drive and invest in some decent, high capacity file storage. My model came with the active pen and it seems to work as advertised.  Kinda annoying that's it's integration is a bit of an afterthought (the included pen holder that sticks into the USB slot gets in the way of all your useful ports and is just begging to be lost) but I'm happy they included it in the package. I haven't dared to test the graphics card on newly released games (which, i read, don't run too great) but i tried the 2016 release \"titanfall 2\" running on the source engine and it runs super smooth (720 p dynamic res, 60 + frames per second).  i believe the touchscreen display does only 60 hrz at 1080 p, but it can output (via HDMI) to another monitor at 4k and a higher frame rate.  keyboard is pretty responsive and the keys have a good feel to them.  arrow keys are kinda cramp and aren't well suited for gaming.  the keys light up on this model and only seem to have 2 brightness settings.  they are adequate and do the job well enough.  though, compared to a macbook pro keyboard, there seems to be a fair amount of light bleeding through the spaces of the keys.  it's a bit hard to see the keys because of this and takes some getting used to. all and all i'm pretty happy about my purchase so far (got it at the $430, black friday discount with $100 off for signing up for an amazon credit card) and it's still a great value at the $550 range. Cons - Wack battery life (4 hour tops for high media consumption computering) Speakers sound muffled when you hold the thing in your lap in laptop mode. Speakers have a plastic rattle that's noticeable at high volumes. 256 GB of storage space is so tiny :( Pros - Lots of bang for your buck.  Probably the highest specced 2 in 1 you can get for the price. Offering the active pen with this deal adds more value to the purchase. It's very compact and versatile. The Ryzen 5 3500u's  Vega 8 handles graphics much better than similar specced Intel builds with an integrated graphics solution. Additional Thoughts:  I spent some time debating whether to get the Ryzen 7, Vega 10 model that can be found on New Egg and Costco but still decided on this one for sheer value.  Available data on comparative PC bench marks (and in computer nerd forum discussions) mention that the Ryzen 7 doesn't preform too much better than the Ryzen 5.  Vega 10 gives a marginal improvement on frame rates for most games but if you purchased this machine for gaming.....then you must really love games from 4 years ago. revised 5/28/20: thought i'd add to my review because i noticed a major problem with the design of the laptop. if you try to do any sort of gaming that requires a decent amount of polygons, the laptop gets too hot to be in your lap and too hot to constantly run at that heat.  it's unfortunate, because the graphics processor is fairly capable for what it is, but the laptop was designed for portability and can' afford the space for better temperature management.  i've gone ahead an ordered a laptop cooling platform (with fans) to help with cooling management and i would suggest you do the same if you look forward to do anything on this computer that requires high polygons or HD video processing."}, {"name": "Mary GM", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2019", "title": "Awesome laptop!", "review_text": "EDIT: The lag in krita is a well known issue.

The good: The touchscreen is good, responsive, and I am enjoying the feel of the pen it came with. The form factor is elegant and enjoyable to handle, it has a good look and feel, from the keyboard to the mouse, and of course the pen. Its also not to heavy for how big it is and what it does. The bad: This is where things get really unfortunate. The screen is ok, I have seen complaints of brightness, its not the worst in the world, but the color accuracy and vibrancy is less than desirable. The battery life will run you 4 hours AT MOST. Do not believe the 8 hours they claim, you will never get that. The AWFUL: Finally, the thing that is making me regretting my purchase, this computer is not stable, my browser crashes often when streaming video, and most video streaming is choppy, and often times low quality.

I'm a power user and use a lot of laptops generally, so considering this $500 products beats some of the premium ones, is actually exceptionally impressive. I run Fedora 31 on this, works out of the box (including the free pen that's included) and it's great to have both touchscreen and the pen work without any further installation. This was not so with some of the other brands including LG gram for example. The laptop gets about 5 hours of wifi browsing/music listening in the background before it needs to be recharged with almost full brightness (around 280nits), this is quite average for most modern light weight laptops, but is about 1/2 short of what I got on LG gram or about 2/3 of Dell XPS or surface laptop.

I'm more of a desktop guy as laptops aren't really capable of upgrade and the sheer cost of components. You get a lot better of a machine with desktop vs laptop. With that being said, I bought this as I needed a laptop for freelance projects. It's kind of hard to pack up a tower and three monitors to go to a business meeting. I couldn't be happier with this purchase. I'm an AMD guy, and the Ryzen 5, 12GB of RAM, included pen, and price sold me over the pricier Intel models. It's pretty fast thus far. Windows loads quickly. I love the ease of access with the fingerprint reader. I learned you don't have to click into the log in screen to use it. Just put your finger on it and it will unlock. I'm a graphic designer/web developer and use power-consuming software such as--basically anything Adobe. the battery life is great thus far. I worked on the laptop on battery for about four hours today and it was at about 30% when I plugged it back in. I was doing a photo edit in Photoshop, had about 10 Chrome tabs open, Excel, OneNote, Trello Desktop, and Outlook open. My biggest complaint is SSD size. 256GB isn't a lot when about 50 is used by Windows and you never actually get the exact amount of space it's rated at, which I knew that before I bought. My primary machine is my desktop, so I'm primarily going to keep the SSD clean and work off OneDrive--only syncing what I'm working on. I haven't learned the pen yet, but it works okay. I'd like more features/functions. Touch is built in Adobe Illustrator, so it's decent there. In Photoshop, however, it was a little counter-productive to try to use in tablet mode.

It is much lighter than the 2017 one, it is a bit smaller too but same screen size which is nice. I had ordered a hard shell protective case for it, same brand that i had on my older laptop but it arrived and did not fit. So i have no case on it. This had led me to notice that fingerprints are super noticeable on the front cover. Kinda annoying but i am gonna try and put stickers all over it  The touchscreen works nice, i use it mostly as laptop but is nice when watching videos One thing that i have noticed is my WiFi on this computer seems spotty everywhere once in a while. Ive opened the same website on both my laptops at the same time and my older one with cracked screen loads pages faster. It works fast most of the time but slow speeds happen frequently enough to get a little annoying The battery life seems to last longer too, i haven't tested to see how long it would last me from 100% to being dead, but it takes like 4 hours to go down like 40 percent maybe, so that is nice. I still bring my cord with just in case i need to charge it. It would be cool if the USB c port in the laptop would charge it with a USB c cable but this laptop does not. The brightness is ok, I went into the display settings and manually turned up the brightness and tweaked with the settings to my preferred view. It is bright and colors are good.

The fact that it can even run Monster Hunter: World on a laptop that I spent $450 on is amazing, but for it to run playable at 30 FPS is unbelievable. Yes, you make compromises on graphical fidelity vs a higher end GPU or a desktop, but at this price and portability, it's a very nice thing to have functional graphics.

One would be hard pressed to find a better speced 2in-1 anywhere near this price. IMPORTANT! Update the BIOS and chipset drivers on lenovos website, the CPU in this is very new to the market, and the newer drivers will significantly increase performance. Linus Tech Tips found this doubled the performance in some tasks because the CPU was not boosting its clock speed properly all of the time. Pros -Solid/lightweight with full 360 rotation on hinge. -Decent battery, which charges quickly. (I get maybe 4-5 hours of moderate to heavy use) -Ryzen2 Processor (New high performance architecture, much better intigrated gpu then intel, low power consumption) -Integrated GPU is much better than intels, not a high preformance discrete GPU, but very usable for light gaming and creative programs. -The stylus works well and is super fun to draw with (I recommend  the free auto-desk sketchbook) Cons -Screen is plenty bright enough for me, but is on the dimmer side. -Speakers can be a bit rattly on high, but sound pretty good otherwise -The advertised 8-10 hour battery life is wishful. (maybe on a dim screen just browsing/typing) -Pen doesn't have tilt sensitivity, (pressure sensitivity works well though) Check out Linus Tech Tips review of this laptop! Ironically this is the cheaper version of this laptop and it preforms better than the more expensive i5 8gb version. This is because Ryzen 3500u is a much newer architecture then the 9th gen Intel i5s. It uses less power and outperforms the i5 version in everything but single core tests, in single core tests it loses by less than 1%.  Plus you get an extra 4gb of RAM!

No numpad though. - Battery life is decent as well considering this houses a low 45Wh battery. Likely due to power management working properly with the CPU since the HP Envy x360 15z (2017) with the R5 2500U had poor battery life in comparison. - The BIOS on the laptop has quite a few options such as disabling PSP (a feature I have no plans on using although I can't confirm if it actually does what it's suppose to). Most of the options I set to default although I set the laptop to performance mode when I plan on playing games.

They kind of play hand in hand too, since if you try to get the most out of the screen then it'll eat into the battery faster. But if you can bring a charger for when it runs out of juice, it makes up for those deficiencies pretty well. The keyboard and track pad are pretty standard for a laptop. I have no complaints. The screen can be a bit wobbly as far as build quality, and the actual base for the laptop does flex pretty hard if you put a lot of force on it. The cooling fan for when the laptop kicks it into gear can get a little loud if it's being worked hard, but it doesn't really bother me that much. It helps that the speakers are pretty fantastic in my experience and will easily drown out the fan if you crank it up. The pen that comes included works fine, but the holder is pretty stupid, honestly. It fits into one of the regular USB 3.0 ports, and it ends up blocking all of your ports and buttons on the right side of the laptop. It doesn't really affect me, but it's worth noting. The tablet mode and drawing works seamlessly for me. I'll probably be using it to take some notes, and it if ends up being annoying I'll come back and update this part. All that being said, it works really well for a general use case. The Ryzen chip does eat up 2 gigs of the RAM out of the 12 that are included, but the performance is great as a result. I think most people can get by on 10 gigs of RAM, easily. I haven't tried much outside web browsing and streaming, but some light gaming can be done with the specs here. It won't play anything modern and demanding, but there is some wiggle room for older titles or for less-demanding ones. I'd categorize this laptop as not extremely good at any one thing, but good enough in a lot of areas.

So here I was, thinking to myself: well no problem! If theres any wifi problems with it when it arrives I can always fix it myself. The thing is, you cant. No matter how many drivers you install, how many options you tweek and change you still CANT fix it unless you physically unscrew the laptop lead and replace the damned Realtek driver card yourself. HOW CAN YOU KEEP SELLING A BROKEN LAPTOP??? Anyhow here's the instruction on how to fix it (took me a long personal time to realize): 1. If you just bought it, you might want to return it before fixing and just buying a new laptop because the new card will cost you around 25$. 2. Purchase the new wifi network card right now!!! (since it will take time until it arrives). I purchased an Intel(R) Wireless-AC 9260 160MHz and it works great. Make sure you buy a proper intel card or else even if you replace the card the wifi will still keep dropping! (trust me I already tried it) 3. Forget about fixing the problem without replacing the card.(like installing different drivers or something like that). It wont help you, trust me I tried. 4. When the card arrives youll have to unscrew the lead. After that, use a guitar pick or something to remove the lead itself. If you dont know how to do it, go look it up on Youtube. There are black and white wires, remove them gently(dont worry about the order that they are connected, it doesnt matter). Remove the screw that holds the card and replace it with the new one. Connect the two wires( you might want to glue a sticker or something that will hold them in place because they come off very easily). Before closing the lead again, turn on the laptop. 5. Now, connect to your wifi network. Click right mouse button on the Start button > Device Manager > Theres an Unknown Device notification there > right click on it and update it(if you wont do this your laptop will randomly turn off because it thinks that theres an unknown device on your pc). After that youre done. Connect the lead back again and the screws. I hope it fixed everything for you. 6. *SMALL TIP FOR YOU GUYS*  ---- if your laptop keeps getting high cpu all the time for no reason it might be because of the Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation program. Open Task Manager and end this task( dont worry it wont do anything bad for your pc). Now your Cpu should be normal. Check the cpu from time to time to see if Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation isnt working cause sometimes it does.

I sent it in with very specific details regarding my concern, following their return procedures precisely. I also followed up with them to find out when it was going to be completed and reiterated the concern at that time. I was very specific with my explanation.

I sent all of that, along with a reiteration of the original concern, which was noted as \"Overheating\" and the remedy was noted as \"Component Replaced.\" (Concern had nothing to do with overheating and what random component was replaced?). I also uploaded a video to youtube of the keyboard buzzing and the corresponding frequencies (with a link to that video in that email). I sent this email on Jan 28 and followed up on Jan 30 with no response. It is Feb 4 and I'm disappointed. I purchased a screwdriver kit to tighten the screw myself and then removed and replaced the key that was buzzing and it's better now (not completely quiet, but good enough. I think the key wasn't properly in place causing the metal connectors to buzz/vibrate). But now I have a big, deep, long scratch on my nice new laptop and a  random new \"component\" and no answer from Lenovo. Concerned if I have any other warranty concerns, what that might look like.

No matter what you have read. Just Google \"Laptop and Tablet Warranties: What They Cover\". Then go to the page from Laptop Mag. Look if you know what you are doing and don't damage anything. You shouldn't have any issues with the warranty. Plus you have to keep the original parts as well. It's also really easy to open with a T5 bit for the ten screws on the bottom. Plus they aren't covered by any rubber feet for easy access. The Ram soldered to the motherboard and the stick that comes with it are 2666Mhz. The motherboard then clocks them down to 2400Mhz. But I would still get 2666Mhz Ram if you upgrade. The only problem is it will be hard to find CL16/17 2666Mhz SODIMMS. Especially 16GB maybe 8GB but 16GB will be harder to find. Don't even think about using Gaming Ram with XMP profiles. Unless the base clock is 2666Mhz and not 2400Mhz. I would also suggest you upgrade to a 1 or 2TB SSD. Only because the 256GB one installed will run out of space if you work with large files, install a lot of applications, or download everything possible. The 1080p touchscreen is great. I'm pretty sure the pen that ships with it is wacom based. Only because the device  and driver id's say Wacom device. Which is kinda cool and means better Wacom pens should work. The USB holder for the pen sucks though. I think I'll look for a elastic cloth one that can stick to the back of the screen under the Lenovo logo. The SD Card reader should have been replaced with a micro SD card reader. This one is only about half depth for a full size card. I just purchased a BaseQI adapter for a micro SD card and us that. It's the one for the Yoga 900&710. Almost perfect size for it as well. It sticks out about 1mm which is just enough to easily get a fingernail on the built in edge and pull it out. The keyboard is nice. I like the backlight. I do wish that you didn't have to have it on or off and it would just come on automatically with a key press. I do really wish they would have used a better WiFi/Bluetooth card than the cheap Realtek 8822BE. There are plenty of documented problems with this card. The driver from Realtek's site is from 8/2017. I still have my Bluetooth mouse lose connection for no reason. Windows even shows it as still connected. Nothing works except restart. I'll probably just buy an Intel card and be done with it. All in all this is a really good laptop besides it several quirks. **************UPDATE 4/21/20********************************************************************************* Installed an Intel Wireless-AC 9260 card purchased on Amazon for $15. Solved the Mouse connection issue. No disconnection since installed a couple days ago. Bluetooth 5.1 is ok as well. Had some stuttering issues with first try. Since then no problems. Just goes to show the Realtek 8822BE card shouldn't be used in anything. Especcially if they can't get the drivers to work with Windows correctly.

The good: - It is super fast and turns on within seconds. - The touch screen works well and is convenient. - There\u2019s a switch to manually block the webcam. - Finger print ID works well. - Comfortable keyboard. The bad: - Screen is incredibly glossy and very difficult to view outside or near a window. I had to get a non-reflective screen protector. - Matte plastic exterior is constantly covered in greasy fingerprints even though I was my hands regularly. - Battery life is not as-advertised. I currently only have Chrome open, and do not have the keyboard lit up, and it is telling me I have 2 hours and 50 minutes on 72% battery. - The screen is somewhat short top to bottom given the large bezel at the bottom. Therefore, you have to scroll a lot when reading and can\u2019t fit much of a document on the screen at once. - It seems like the speakers may be on the bottom of the computer. While they have good volume, they can have a weird buzzing noise if the computer is seated on your lap and not a hard surface. - Charger cord is much shorter than my Apple cord.

The second laptop was mfg'd a few months after the original was and it already had windows 1903 on it and came shipped with the problem. This is no little known issue its all over the internet and I do think a proper driver update could fix this though as it did not have these problems until the windows 1903 and 1909 updates but how long should you have to wait for your laptop to properly work?  This laptop will play most older games just fine if you don't need a stable internet connection that is. Don't expect it to run any newer AAA's though. The most intensive game I've played on it is GTA V and on decent settings it'll stay at around 30fps on high settings with some tweaks don't expect and very high or ultra settings though. on lower settings I can get around 45-50fps. The screen is also a disappointment. It's only 250nits which is awful so while it's 1080p the colors are washed and the screen has a yellowish tint. When comparing it to a TV via hdmi port its day and night colors are completely different. This laptop could be great if the screen were 300+ nits and if the wifi didn't drop so much. It could use more storage too because 256gb isn't much at all nowadays. They could've added an hdd or upgraded the sdd to 500. I know they can only do so much because of the price but I mean just a couple large games will complemently fill up the storage. I could look past most of the issues if the wifi actually worked like it should. The main reason it's two stars is because of the wifi issues.

While the display is 14', the actual display real estate is 13\" because there is an inch of the screen that is black and really doesn't serve a purpose other than it just being like a border. It really doesn't make sense to me why Lenovo has designed their screen this way. It is rather deceiving to say the least. For this reason, this is why I gave it four starts.

The battery life is horrible, and I've never gotten near the 10-hour mark even when I do basic web browsing stuff with no other programs or apps open. Also, the battery doesn't charge up to 100% and the computer shuts down when the meter says there's still 5 or 6% left.

The Flex 14 does have some downsides, like the ips screen which has an okay contrast ratio and poor color saturation. But that's really it. The keyboard is very comfortable, the trackpad feels quite nice, the pen works incredibly well, the folding feature is intuitive and works well, the battery has okay longevity, and more importantly, charges very quickly with the compact included charger. This new laptop and its charger combined weigh a pound less than my last laptop. For performance, at stock settings, the ryzen 5 3500u is relatively unimpressive. It's moderately slower than the Intel cpu, and a bit more power efficient. However, in use, I noticed that the fans stay incredibly quiet, and that the chip itself never goes above 65\u00b0 in synthetic load. So, by tweaking the power limits up a bit, I was able to increase the fan speed, get core temps up to 75\u00b0, and boost multicore CPU performance by 40%. This also improved gpu performance by 15%. With this tweak, the Flex 14 is unbeatable. This laptop easily performs well into the $1000 price range, and I recommend it to any college student.

I am a hobby artist so I was looking for something I could use with ClipStudio or photoshop with an interactive pen. This was the affordable laptop that I landed on. I thought it would be really nice to draw in bed while I dozed off. Lucky me, this laptop was more convenient than I thought it would be. I do a lot of textbook reading for classes on it, and its been nice to browse through the shops on it while I lounge on my couch. Its small- but not too small, it fits in my backpack which would be really nice if classes were still open (they're closed due to covid-19). It had no trouble installing ClipStudio and I have come to prefer the touch screen Tablet version while I do my reading or watch videos, etc. Has been nice doing my homework in the comfort of my bed, my old laptop's keys were messed up and it was pretty big so I didn't use it much- this Lenovo laptop is much better and I am extremely impressed and happy about my purchase. Using the pen with clip studio has been nice, it sense pressure which is awesome. The sound quality is pretty good too, I was surprised with how loud this smallish laptop could get- much louder and clearer than my old one. I really like it, and I'm really happy I bought it.

Very upset with this product now. The basics all work fine, but there seems to be a well-established issue with the AudioSmart feature that comes with this device which conflicts with audio controls in Zoom calls. It turns off your microphone on EVERY Zoom call in the first minute or so. You can manually turn it back on, but it is a PAIN IN THE ASS to do every single time, and there is no fix forth coming. Furthermore, I cannot get any help with this from Lenovo. The website is telling me my device is not supported even though it's only 6 months old, so that's a bunch of crap. If you want to buy problems with no help, go ahead an get yourself one of these! Here's some original feedback I gave: \"I did not expect that I would want to use a touchscreen and I wasn't even sure I needed the 360 degree swivel, but I figured I should keep up with tech. Turns out I use both regularly and really like having these features! My biggest complaint is the screen glare [this has now shifted to the above, and screen glare is the second biggest complaint]. It can get pretty bad depending on where you sit. This is amplified by the ample fingerprints all over the screen when the glare is higher. I have been happy with the screen size I chose (14\"). It feels plenty big enough for me (for a laptop anyway). The camera resolution is pretty poor. If I need to video conference with anyone in a professional context I would be concerned about presenting in such poor resolution, especially for a job interview. However, for my current use, it's not something I worry about too much. Also, when I'm video conferencing, the audio disconnects at the start of the conference every time. I have to mute and unmute the speaker or mic every time at least once. It's quirky and could be some kind of driver conflict. Annoying, but works fine after I do that once [clearly I was not bothered by this after just one month...but this is a major flaw in my opinion now]. The laptop does come with some \"extra\" software (bloat) that I wish it hadn't and popups reminding you to do all these things you don't want to do. Hate that. The buttons on the pen are hard to figure out. Not my favorite feature, but the pen itself is pretty cool. It's my first time using one and I like it.

Keyboard (*7/10). Coming from a gaming laptop with a mechanical keyboard I actually prefer typing on this one. The keys have a little wobble but still respond with any angle. The spacing is quite good. I wish they would fit full size up & down arrows. When programming I constantly miss click the up or down. The back light works, that's it, it just works. Nothing to write home about. The screen (*8/10) is quite good, its sharp, colors are adequate, I just wish it was a little brighter. Unusable in direct sunlight.

I narrowed it down between this laptop and a similar one on the Lenovo website and ultimately ended up purchasing this one as it had similar features but was significantly less expensive. Sadly, what I saved in cash I gave up in reliability. I will say that the smaller size makes the laptop easy to carry around, however it is extremely heavy (heaver than my old 17 in Dell). The keyboard keys are easy to use, I don't feel like I have to beat my keyboard to make an impression. I like the 2-in-1 feature as well--the screen is relatively easy to write on. One major issue that I have with the screen writing feature is that when I set my whole hand on the screen to write (as one does when they write) the screen will often jump to a completely different area or open a dialogue box. My biggest mark against this laptop is the subpar battery life--I'm averaging about 2 hours total before I need to plug the laptop in. I typically only have a document and a few browser windows open. I've had to resort to carrying the cord around for times I need to plug the laptop in as well as an extension cord because the charging cord itself is extremely short. I have mixed feelings about the pen that came with the laptop, I find it to be sensitive to write with. However, the way its designed does not lend itself to long term use which is a pretty big mark against it in my eyes as one of the main reasons I purchased this specific laptop was so that I could hand write notes on it. Lastly, the screen has started randomly going black and there is almost no way to turn it back on unless I plug in or unplug that charging cable. Overall, I'm pretty disappointing that I spent ~$600 on a laptop and the features that I bought it for are subpar. I definitely would not recommend that someone purchase this laptop."}, {"name": "David Lynch", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2020", "title": "Powerful and Portable", "review_text": "I purchased this laptop to accompany me on frequent trips for work/leisure.

Great value for a tough box.", "review_text": "For the price, this is an excellent Chromebook. After opening the box, I've done my fair share of research. 1. Solid build at an undefeatable price. Not many things you can do now for 110 bucks. A full tank gas for my SUV costs more than that. 2. USB type C port, SD card slot, and USB 3.0 3. 4 gigs of RAM is good though the 16gb memory is not enough, just insert $3 32gb micros sd card, it is much better than spend $100 more for a 64gb disk. With 20 bucks, we can make it 144GB. Why buy more expensive one. Besides, you have google cloud free for you. 5. Nice feel to the keyboard and track pad. 6. ARM processor that is optimized for the Google play store apps and runs much better than the Intel celerons you see in most low-end Chromebooks. 7. Great for travel. I wanted something I could put in my carry-on, perfect in size and 10 hours movie time on the flight. That is incredible. You get a lot for the low price, it is hard to believe. I think the fair price for this one would be 150 at least. You can't really find those options within that price range. The only thing I wish it had was a touch screeon display. 1366x768 still looks sharp on an 11.6 in screen but it would be super cool if it is a touch screen.

There, I said it.  Oh I tried to justify it. \"It's only 100 bucks, it ain't so bad\", I kept telling myself. But after a few hours of trying to get things done with the 100E, I just have to admit this to myself: it's just not a good Chromebook and a waste of a Benjamin. Let me preface this by saying that I've had probably 8 or 9 different Chromebooks in my life, of varying sizes and price points. This includes 4 different 11-inchers I've used for various purposes. I'm comparing my experience with the Lenovo with that of those other 11-inch Chromebooks. Apples to apples, and all that. It's such a tempting thing isn't it? For a hundred bucks you get a full fledged Chromebook, and it's even got 4GB of memory which is pretty much the minimum even for Chromebook.Should be at least \"good enough\", right? But jeez this thing has probably THE worst screen of all time. Everything is washed out. Blacks are barely gray. Text is slightly blurry. You can force to resize the resolution within Chrome itself but no matter what, the quality of the screen is just awful. Despite the aforementioned reasonable 4GB of memory, and a -in theory - acceptable processor (MediaTek MT8173C), it's a very sluggish machine. Even basic web browsing just feels slow, like it's fighting to pull up basic web pages. The WiFi radio appears to be a culprit as well, although I haven't run any real tests about that. Point is: even basics are slow with the 100E. They keyboard is black and the key markings (letters) are very dark, so unless you're using this in a well-lit room, you better be a good touch typist. Except of course due to the mini size of this, keys may not be where you think they are. Everything is super cramped so even if you're normally a good touch-typist, you'll be missing keys. It's frustrating but this latter issue is not confined to Lenovo, it's a size thing. What IS a Lenovo thing is the shoddy quality of the keys. Travel is weird (too high) and the keys FEEL like the cheapest plastic possible. Even for a machine that costs 100 bucks I expected more since it comes from Lenovo. But the keys on the 100E are the worst of all my 11-inch Chromebooks. Of course there is no backlighting at this price point. No surprise, and many folks don't feel like they usually need one - but you really need it with a terrible keyboard like this. The top lid is a fingerprint magnet. The body is surprisingly thick and clunky. I do love that it charges via USB-C and has 2 such ports. For this price point you can't expect miracles, but honestly, it's so slow and sluggish, I wouldn't even give this to my 4 year old. (He has a 100 dollar Teqnio Chromebook from Walmart which is astoundingly good for the money, with far better screen, better keys, and faster performance) It's too sluggish to even use as a security camera monitor. You can watch Youtube videos on it but with that awful screen, it won't be pretty. I'm keeping this as a backup to my backup computers, maybe throw it in the back of the car (without being logged in to Google account, for security reasons) or maybe I'll give it to a homeless person or something (hey, free Wifi at McD+ this 100E + free time = next great American novel),  but besides that I just can't recommend it.

I bought this Lenovo 100e because two of my previous chromebooks have reached end of life.

Most will receive updates for approximately 6 years from the time the model was introduced, not the date that the customer acquired it.

The Lenovo 100e is a sturdy machine built to military specifications for the education market. The cover does not show fingerprints. The screen is not IPS, but is clear when not viewed from a sharp angle. There are a limited number of ports. There is only one USB port and one type C port which is used for charging. I would recommend that Lenovo add another USB port and another type C port to the right side of the computer in future iterations of the Lenovo 100e.

The laptop seemed to work great in general when I started changing my settings and searching for websites.  However, the charger fit into the charging port very loosely, and when I moved the laptop on my lap it fell out easily. I figured I might have gotten a laptop with a faulty charging port and I returned it for a replacement. The second new Acer Chromebook R11 that Amazon sent me had a normal charging port. The charger fit well and did not fall out. But, the touchpad did not work. I tried to troubleshoot it and change touchpad settings, however every time I moved my fingers on the touch pad the cursor jumped around the screen. I ended up returning this one as well and choosing a more expensive laptop from a different company as I planned originally. My friend's Acer Chromebook R11 works fine and he has had it about 6 months. He was surprised that I had these troubles. I'm not sure what the quality control process is.

This only has 20GB memory. Not a problem for most, since they're meant to work from Google Drive or other cloud storage. But sensitive case files can't go on those, so I stuck a 512GB sd card in there.

No more wishing I could tinker with a motion when my laptop is too inconvenient to set up (or not with me). This thing boots in under 2 seconds and I'm plugging away. 10 hour battery life means I charge it at night and that's it, unless I'm actually traveling and therefore using it all day (rather than my desktop or laptop). The only limitations are inherent to the android apps. Adobe doesn't support rendering documents text readable, and MS Word has fewer features as well. That's ok, those are mostly things I can do in the \"polishing\" phase from my office computer. This gets me to the 99% mark when I would otherwise be stuck.

I'm thankful I did, since it was sold out within an hour or two and has been since. Let's get the rundown here. - Ryzen 5 4500U 6c6t APU - Radeon Vega 6 graphics - 16 GB of DDR4-3200 MHz dual-channel RAM (CL 22, but that's par for the course for a consumer laptop) - 256 GB SK Hynix NVMe SSD - 1080p IPS touchscreen w/digitizer (pen included!) Build quality is about as good as you can get without moving to all metal. The keyboard deck is rubberized, and the outside is built solidly - no creaking! Hinge is strong, but that makes it hard to open with one hand. Not a huge problem for me (or likely for most people), but reviewers bring it up a lot so I figured I'd mention it. The overall design is darn near similar to last year's model, but built a bit more \"premium.\" One exhaust vent at the back, but as you'll see later it really doesn't need 2. I mainly focused on CPU performance, as benchmarks for this flavor of Vega 6 are all over the place already, and given the thermals I saw performance should be what you'll find elsewhere. Long story short - roughly 10% faster than the 3500U's Vega 8 at less power (15 W vs 25 W). The benchmarks speak for themselves, but I was very surprised at what this thing was capable of. I ran these on the included USB-C wall charger (which was a surprising inclusion considering the laptop has a barrel jack for power). The only thing to keep in mind is that this was tested when my room temperature was in the upper 70s to lower 80s, so you could see the temp results as a \"worst case\" scenario. 77c absolute max during Geekbench is crazy for this thing, especially considering how thin it is. Never got too loud, either. Fan isn't whiny at all! I did not test the battery nor camera, but the battery is larger over last year's model - 52 Wh vs 45 or so. Couple that with the improved efficiency of Zen 2 and it should be pretty solid. Honestly, I could think of only 3 things that would make this laptop better, but all of them would definitely drive up the price/bump it up a tier: - 120 Hz FreeSync display like the (crippled by 8 GB RAM) IdeaPad Slim 7 - Ryzen 4600U/4800U options for more threads (or at least a 4700U option once stock stabilizes) - Metal construction I'll personally be upgrading the storage, but overall it's amazing."}, {"name": "Chen Li", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2020", "title": "Solid product for the price", "review_text": "For <600, there's only 1 thing I want to complain: the \"Lenovo Representative\" knows nothing about their product.

It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.

The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..). Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery. 2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is. The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough. The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive. Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted. A couple of things that annoy me: -The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting... -The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off. -The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector.

It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money. _____________________ This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain. I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly. What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there. On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything. Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it. After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.

Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks. The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor. The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop. This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop. Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect. Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing. Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem. The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price. I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need. The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured. This boots in about 15 seconds. It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with. This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING. I can't sing the praises of this enough. Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine. Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.

This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy. I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness. Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2. Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666. Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%. Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%. I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though. Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices. I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium. This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant ."}, {"name": "Mindy", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2019", "title": "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors", "review_text": "I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable. I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back. Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up. I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect. I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus! So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be."}, {"name": "Callie", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2019", "title": "Games", "review_text": "It runs amazing"}, {"name": "vikingpiper", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2019", "title": "STAY AWAY from Microsoft 10S!!!", "review_text": "BUYER BE AWARE: This computer has Microsoft 10S.

Just needs a couple inexpensive upgrades", "review_text": "Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too. Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board). The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places. UPGRADES: I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow. I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with. Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode. Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer. Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.

The processing power is not very strong, so performance-wise, I was not impressed. But with the pricetag considered, I'm all right with this. However, the biggest thing for me is the OS- WINDOWS 10-IN S MODE. I had never heard of S Mode, and I didn't notice this when I bought the laptop. Apparently, S Mode is Microsoft's way of ensuring that you only use their apps and products by blocking you from downloading any outside apps. You have to get them all through their store. So, for example, were I to try to download Norton's anti-virus from Norton's official site, Microsoft's S Mode would tell me that I am unable. Any and all files outside of their store are blocked from being downloaded. In order to leave S Mode, you have to change it in the settings, but then you have to use a registration key for Windows 10 Home or Pro. So I shelled out another $130 just to get a fully functioning OS. Factor that price into this laptop price. THEN- after purchasing Windows 10 Home, I had to keep trying over the course of 4 days for the laptop to accept me switching out of S Mode because Microsoft was conveniently having server errors on their side and so my request could not be processed at this time. This is a common issue, at least from what I read among those discussing S Mode on Reddit forums. Multiple people report that Microsoft has server issues when you try to opt out of S Mode. Very very unhappy with this laptop for the sole reason that the OS is Windows 10 in S Mode. It was inconvenient and one of the most useless things I have ever seen pre-installed on a computer.

Just go buy from one of the reputable makers including Samsung, Hynix, and Micron, and I strongly recommend 2400 instead of 2666. I know the OEM RAM is 2666 but it REALLY does't matter. 2666 is the highest clock the OEM will support, but this CPU can only run up to 2400 MHz. When clock is 2400 both RAM have zero difference, but the current prices for both speed are different. In terms of SSD slot upgrade, I would recommend Samsung's EVO which is definitely the best out there. Most reliable and fastest in its class.

For starters, some background context: I am in my mid-20s and have long since finished uni. I am not a gamer. I primarily use my laptop(s)/tablets for streaming shows/movies; occasionally working from home; and crafting/design editing. I used to go through every iteration of a MacBook but, while nice, soon found myself not really utilizing all of its features & could no longer justify its price-point (especially since I do still have an iPhone). This laptop is a STEAL for ~$300. I did my research and honestly, like a majority of the other reviews here said, the Acer Aspire 5 blows every other product in its price bracket out of the water. That said, I went into this fully knowing I wanted an inexpensive laptop and that, because of that constraint, whatever I ended up purchasing would most likely have some limitations. If you purchased this and are disappointed about the specs in correlation to it being ~$300.... I really don't know what to tell you other than that you definitely were looking in the wrong place. I solely bought this computer because I recently got a CRICUT Explore Air 2 and needed something compatible with it (Chromebooks won't work and my MacBook is so old it can barely handle the newest OS); however, I already know now that this is going to become my main laptop and I will get a lot of use from it outside of just crafting. THE IMPORTANT STUFF: 1.) This is a solidly-built laptop. Very sturdy, very lightweight. Perfect for on-the-go. It IS aluminum though the whole way around, so I recommend buying a case or sleeve to avoid scratching. 2.) The screen resolution and sound quality is surprising very good, crisp, and clean - while I think perhaps it could be a tad bit brighter, that's just me being nit-picky. I would still recommend using external speakers if you want to retain the quality of sound at its loudest setting, especially if what you listen to is bass-heavy. 3.) Turning off Windows S-Mode was absolutely painless - it's literally just going to the website that's taped on the outside of the box and clicking one or two buttons. 4.) Like other reviewers recommended, I did purchase another 8GB of RAM and installed it myself (I googled YouTube videos on how to do this for this specific laptop model; there are plenty of them, just take it slow and you'll be fine). I opted to leave IN the 4GB stick that was already there, thus giving myself a total of 12GB RAM. The difference in speed is HUGE and, like I said, I'm not using this for *too* much other than everyday use. Spend that little bit of extra money if you can, I promise it's worth it! I can't speak to anything as to whether it would hold-up with gaming, but definitely for a solid several hours of streaming content, crafting, and/or having multiple tabs & apps open simultaneously. 5.) The track-pad is VERY sensitive. Not so much so that I would take off a star, but enough to notice. I recommend purchasing a wireless mouse if you plan on doing more intricate work to eliminate any annoyance or mistakes. I bought one (a Logitech one, $10) and so far it's definitely made designing and editing much easier. It's been awhile since I've had a PC but it's nice to know that a lot of its shortcomings (such as memory space & speed) can easily be fixed and modified to your preference. Again, at the end of the day, this is NOT a heavyweight laptop, both literally and figuratively speaking, but that's okay because it's not meant to be! Overall, I would highly recommend this computer to anyone who is looking for an everyday laptop that is both budget-friendly without sacrificing too much of its quality."}, {"name": "Michael", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2019", "title": "Could not set it up", "review_text": "this machine kept telling me that i am underage. could not find the windows product code. 4 amazon people just made it worse. i don't know what is wrong but it is driving me out of my mind."}, {"name": "M.

I do not know if this was a return or something but I tested it out anyways. Based on normal use I say this is OK with the exception of some weird glitching in which the laptop screen momentarily turns all black. It has happened around three times already. I was just using it for browsing and video watching. It has only been a couple of days of use and this is already happening. Something is wrong with this but I am no techie so I don't know what. I did the usual troubleshooting...turn it off and on again. It didn't fix the problem. Beside this, the screen is really nice to look at. The bezels are thin which makes the viewing of shows wonderful. The screen is more matte than glassy which I find that I prefer compared to the glossy screen on my Asus (which performs way better than the Acer one without a question since mine is super expensive). The keyboard is easy to type and the layout of it is useful in that they had enough space to put a full number pad to the right. The power button threw me off because it wasn't at the side of the laptop it was found on the keyboard itself (upper right). Lasting capabilities is around 5-6 hours of continuous usage for me.

The AMD Ryzen 3 3200U CPU packs a good amount of processing in its two cores and two threads per core. When I received my unit, I went through the Windows 10 mini setup.  The system ran fine in the provided Windows 10. I decided to install my operating system of choice which is Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS Desktop 64 bit edition.  In my experience, I found that the Acer Aspire 5 FLIES in Ubuntu or any Linux for that matter in comparison with Windows. Interestingly, I installed VirtualBox so that I could see how the Ryzen 3 3200U would handle virtualization. As it turns out, my Windows 10 virtual machine somehow ran even better than the shipped Windows 10. I also created virtual machines for Elementary OS and the new Linux Mint 19.2 beta. Both those VMs booted in seconds and performed well. If you plan on using virtual machines much with this laptop, I would add memory. The system comes with a single memory stick that is 4GB. There are two memory slots and if you have two matched memory sticks, they would takes advantage of dual channel memory access which might speed the system even more. In my tests, Libre Office writer and calc both launched from scratch in under 4 seconds. I installed both Firefox and Chrome on my Ubuntu and they are both very snappy. I used both the wired Ethernet and also the wireless card which I connected via 802.11ac and it performed very well. The only downside that I found with this system is the touch pad. The touch pad is very large and is impossible to avoid while typing on the keyboard and so I had a lot of typing corrupted by false hits on the touch pad. I finally turned the touch pad off via the Ubuntu mouse control panel and used an external mouse and the problem was solved. This is NOT a gaming machine by any means. It is an excellent machine for web surfing, document editing and email though. I found that the battery is good for almost 3 hours and charges very quickly. This system was well worth the price and is a welcome addition to my home computing environment."}, {"name": "Masta' C", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2019", "title": "A Solid 4-Star Laptop! Lightweight, Great Screen, Fair Battery, Easily Upgradeable!", "review_text": "Even at the non-Prime Day price, this laptop is still a solid contender in the \"budget\" arena of laptops.  My family purchased 3 and we are all quite happy with them.  It's lightweight, thin and comes packed with the essential features most non-gamers need to work and play.  Plus, it looks great! For the low price, you do give up a few premium features, such as a better CPU, USB-C ports, a large battery and lots of memory and storage.  However, the beautiful 1080p IPS screen, full keyboard layout, spaciousa and responsive touchpad, USB 3.1 ports and stereo speakers easily cover the basics and then some. Plus, memory and hard drive space can be easily upgraded for very little cost, making it possible to match the features of more expensive models without the price tag. The Ryzen 3 processor is plenty fast for most users and the onboard graphics are better than the graphics on Intel's competing i3 and i5 processors.  That said, this laptop does benefit greatly from a small memory upgrade for both speed and graphics performance.  Simply adding a second 4GB stick of DDR4 2400 or 2666 RAM to the free slot inside is all most users will need to get the most out of this laptop. If you plan on gaming heavily, you may want to look elsewhere, as that's not the strength of this particular model.  But, for basic photo/video editing and daily tasks like web browsing, spreadsheets and word processing, the Ryzen cpu with a low-cost 4GB memory upgrade is more than adequate. For users who need more internal storage, Acer has left a slot open inside the laptop which allows a 7mm thick 2.5\" SSD to be added at any time.  With prices falling on SSDs in the 256GB-512GB range, this is a welcome feature and a simple plug-n-play upgrade. Battery life is less than advertised.  Expect around 4 hours of continuous use, compared to the 7+ the manufacturer claims.  I'm assuming the battery can be upgraded to a better one at a later time, since it's easily accessible when the back cover is removed.  However, don't be put off when you find yourself plugging in for a recharge a little sooner than expected.  It's still \"average\" compared to most other laptops. Sound is decent, but not stellar.  Similarly, the trackpad feels a bit \"cheap\" when pressing at the edges, but it works very well and the response is really good overall. All in all, this is a great basic laptop out of the box and just a few dollars put into a couple small upgrades can really go a long way toward maximizing its performance and functionality.

The screen quality is very good.  The backlit keyboard is nice.  It is also VERY light, and that is great. Cons so far (3 days):  There is no light on the keyboard to tell you when cap lock or num lock are on.  I found this to be a problem straight out of the box setting it up when I couldn't tell what were the capital letters in the password I was putting in!  Secondly, a good bit of the set up involved telling Microsoft exactly how I want them to spy on me, but not giving me any options of not being spied on.  My millenial daughter says people don't care about this any more, but I find it offensive that MS thinks they have the right to know everything I do on my computer and to put ads on it at their whim.  I only get to choose whether I want them personalized or not.  My word. It's none of their business! Thirdly, when I tried to install the program from my job that I bought this computer to use, of course it wouldn't install because of S mode.  When I told it I wanted out of S mode it told me I had to go to the MS Store and buy MS Home for $139!!  My thanks to all the other reviewers who said I could get out of S mode for free.  I finally googled it and MS's own website had the directions I needed.  Note that when I went into settings it was telling me the computer couldn't activate Windows in big red letters.  I had to respond to that first before the \"Switch out of S Mode\" prompts appeared, but I finally did manage to get out of it.

For someone that runs a few light to medium programs, photo/video editing, streaming, school work, etc., this computer has what it takes.

Our criteria was we wanted LED backlit HD screen, backlit keyboard, aluminum shell/case, attractive, full Qwerty keyboard with numeric keypad, good battery life, fingerprint reader, ample ports with HDMI, light weight, slim bezel,  and fast. Lastly, it had to be within a budget of under $600. This Acer meets all we wanted. There's nothing wrong with conventional HDD if you know how to take care of your machine. By that I mean, KEEP IT CLEANED! Acer, in its infinite wisdom, pre-installed a utility called ACER CARE CENTER. In this single utility you can defrag, clean out the junk, clean the disk, check health of battery, hard drive, etc. Use it! Some have complained their Acer is slow. Have you cleaned it? Expect to spend the first 3 or 4 hours just getting all the Windows 10 updates installed. After just that, I ran the Acer Care utility to find the hard drive was 28% fragmented, and disk needed to be cleaned. So, defragged and cleaned, then went on to add our many programs. When all done with everything, defragged and cleaned again. It boots up in 15 seconds. Battery life on any laptop is dependent upon the programs and use. Don't expect 10 hours. 5 to 7 hours of word processing, surfing, video/photo editing, and some streaming. Even at current sale price of $349 it's still worth it.

Looking to low end game. Pros: Got it at a great price on Prime Day. Great looking screen for the price. Very thin and lightweight no noticeable difference from my chromebook. Decent computer that upgrades well. Add some ram and it does some decent low end gaming. The NVMe SSD is very quick many of the low end laptops don't have this yet. 2 ram slots for dual channel many low ends only have 1. Cons: Ram runs at 2400 not 2666 don't believe the Acer reps here I have tested it myself with multiple sticks including the one that came with the laptop. Needs more ram for what I needed. If you just want to browse the internet and watch streams its ok. Keyboard back lighting looks bad some keys are much brighter then others I bothers me. No easy way to get to the ram battery or drives. Small SSD but I get what I pay for My goals are to be able to play some Classic World of Warcraft. Not raiding but auction house professions and a easy quest or two during down time at work. I must also be able to tab out quickly to my work spreadsheets and pricing sites. I know for sure the amount of ram would not do for what I wanted and would need to be upgraded and I had included this into my pricing thoughts. I went with 16gb ddr4 2666 cl15 for about $73. A little overkill but 8gb would be pushing it with all my work stuff needing to be open and ready at anytime and 2gb being reserved for graphics.  Being a Ryzen and integrated graphics it gets good use of the higher quality ram 2666 (15cl vs 18 or 19cl) so I splurged a extra $10 for. stock ram included was listed at 19cl for anyone that cares. I know classic wow is not a intense game but its really hard to find out how bad a laptop you can get and have it run bare minimum settings. I was looking at the E5-576G-5762 for about $599 and I would still want to up the ram in that but looking to save some money on a laptop I would only use twice a week really I decided to give this a try after much research. So for Team Fight Tactics I am getting 60 to 100 fps late game full teams can bring it down but its stays over 90 for the most part. Classic WoW I am currently playing with 1080p settings 3 (the classic like setting) getting from 60 to 120 fps while I can't test a raid yet I have only been able to use this for the stress test. moving up to settings 4 lowers the fps to 40 to 70 range. I am currently at 80% used of the SSD with only wow, classic wow, league of legends and a benchmark app installed. I would probably install a few more games just to test out but no space for now. Guess that will need upgraded at some point but honestly other then discord I don't plan to have anything else on here.

It can play any \"last gen\" game - so Rocket League, Skyrim, Minecraft - at high settings 60fps nbd and generally anything that's been ported to mobile (Fortnite) will run at 60fps at low settings. I will say this again: Your performance will be LITERALLY cut in half without that $14 stick of RAM. Just get the stupid thing. Don't be a dipstick. Don't believe me? Look up the benchmarks for this laptop. The CPU cores communicate over the RAM and so do the APU cores. Slowing down traffic by half also slows down *EVERYTHING* by half because it's going to be the bottleneck once performance otherwise maxes out - and with 2 cores it will max out quickly with games. That said, the desktop isn't dead. If you're looking to run games primarily - or you at least know that that's something you want to do - and those games aren't last gen - I'd strongly recommend building a PC.

I purchased three of these PC Laptops for my clinic (external use; not for patient data).  It took me TWO HOURS to set them up.  I put all three on the countertop and just went from one to the other. This is what I always do.  There's always irritation to work around with setting up computers but these were the worst ones yet.  You have to ensure you don't connect them to the internet during setup because if you do ... YOU MUST ABSOLUTELY sign in with your Microsoft account (or create another one).  They have completely removed the \"create local account\" (the traditional way to log in).  If you entered your wireless network info, you have to (a) unplug your modem and (b) restart the computer and start the set-up all over again because there is no way to \"back up\" to the network entry section.  So terrible.  Because they removed the option to choose a local account, their reasoning for this is simply to control you and your computing experience.  For personal use, this may be okay.  For corporate use, not a chance!  The security problems are incredible with this setup.  You're going to get sued!  So -- after this ordeal, windows is set up.  First thing I ALWAYS do is install Google Chrome and then make it default.  Well, MS made that practically impossible too!  There's now a standard \"Windows S Mode Edition.\"  This is purportedly to prevent you from installing unauthorized content to save your computer.  This is nonsense.  It's a way to ensure everyone uses their crappy MS Edge browser.  Their browser always sucked.  Their browser currently sucks.  Their browser will always suck.  That's why people get rid of it.  But they force you to use it.  You have to now download some app that turns MS S Mode off (that MS makes and publishes).  That would be fine, but now Windows uses a digital copy instead of a key and the digital license ... you guessed it ... could not be verified.  Yep, several restarts, updates, and other bologna and finally I was able to install the S Mode bypass so that I could download Chrome.  Then there's the bloatware.

However, due to terrible support and shady practices, it's been wildly cheapened by Acer. 1. Acer installed their own adware on my device without my knowledge or consent.  Worse, they created unchangeable notification settings, buried the installation files in a hidden directory, abused the character limit to hide it from the program removal tool; either hid it from the registry with deceptive location and naming, or used a scheduled executable and won't provide the information necessary to determine whether simply deleting the files is safe. 2. People who have deleted the files are reporting either a failure to completely remove [meaning the files bounced back] or breaks caused by the removal of the files.  These breaks include loss of data, boot looping, massive decrease in system performance, and registry errors. 3. Acer has provided no tool for removing their bloatware.  One must blindly trust a third party tool for the \"safe\" removal of the software. 4. The tech support doesn't know how to remove the software, instead redirecting me to other resources that either don't address this specific issue directly or don't provide a solution.  Windows cannot detect and remove software that has a name longer than 60 characters in the registry.  The removal must be performed through the registry.  Because the identify of these files in the registry is not published, it would take hours - days to find and remove the software via the registry.  This method could result in the aforementioned breaks, especially if done incorrectly.  For example, an accidental removal of a vital system file could occur. 5. After waiting well over half an hour in their support queue, being as how I got in before they closed for business, the support team left for the day while I was STILL waiting for support.  The chat support agent doesn't open after hours.  I have a screenshot of the agent being open, meaning I made it in time for support.  They simply didn't care and left anyway. I bought this machine for work and have to deal with interruptions because of this adware.  I haven't owned this device for even two whole months yet.  This wasn't an issue until this week, when the adware went active.  During some automatic system update, this was enabled.  After the last automatic system update from last month (March 25, 2020), I took advantage of my Windows Pro privileges, looked up the proper way to disable automatic system updates, and then promptly did so [this cannot be done through normal Windows system settings without setting up a metered connection, which I'm unable to do because I telecommute for work and it would interfere with the systems in place with my employer]. The hardware is EXCELLENT for the price, however, the experience with Acer is a NIGHTMARE.  I won't suggest missing this device.  Buy it, buy and install Windows 10 Pro, find out how to turn off automatic system updates via the Group Policy Editor, disable automatic updates there and in system settings [to be safe] AS SOON AS it this laptop boots for the first time, buy and install your [secondary] 2.5 inch SSD / HDD / hybrid drive, and buy and install your RAM upgrades [up to 32 GB supported].  If you do that, you'll have a wonderful experience with this device.  If you make the mistake of trusting Acer not to compromise your system through updates after you purchase, you'll have a pretty bad experience trying to fix what they sneakily do to it.  Once you're loaded with dozens of GB of data, it's not nearly so easy to just start over. This rating is justified by this company policy.  The company did this to my laptop.

Normally, you have to hold \"Fn\" and hit an F key to use the function, but it was reversed on this machine. Also, the keyboard backlight turned itself off after 20 seconds of inactivity whether or not it was plugged in. It kind of defeats the purpose of a backlit keyboard, in my opinion, when you can't see the keys before you start typing. At any rate, both the F key and backlight issues were mostly fixed when I updated the BIOS directly from the Acer support site. I was then able to find settings for both in BIOS and disable automatic function key and backlight timeout. My only gripe is that there doesn't seem to be any way to keep the backlight on for more than 20 seconds when unplugged, no matter the power settings or BIOS configuration. Lots of Googling and worthless Acer chat support sessions later, I'm convinced there's no workaround. That issue aside, I can't really say anything else negative about this machine. At this price point, this is about as good as it gets. If you plan on doing anything other than browsing the internet and using Office, I do recommend purchasing an additional 4GB RAM stick and installing it yourself. It took me maybe 5 minutes with a YouTube tutorial video. Between that extra RAM and the stock SSD, I can run low-end games with Chrome and Skype running in the background all at once with no slowdown whatsoever.

I'm still messing with screen brightness settings to see if that makes a difference. I'll update this if it becomes a five star product. So, you want to install Linux? You probably won't be able to enable Legacy Boot, so discard that option if youtube and google told you to try that, unless your BIOS is somehow different from mine. You will need to: 1) Google how to make a bootable USB compatible with UEFI, then get your Linux ISO burned onto the USB. 2) Turn on your Acer and hit F2 right after the first splash screen to access the BIOS options 3) Setup a Supervisor Password (If you want it blank, I think it can be blank. Or make it something easy to remember and go back and change it to an empty field.) 4) Step 3 allows you to turn off Secure Boot. Look for it in the menus and do it. 5) Enable F12 boot menu (this allows you to select a USB to boot from). This is also in the menus. 6) Save changes and restart 7) Insert USB with bootable ISO 8) Restart, 9) hit F12 right after first splash screen, and you will have an option to select your USB to boot from. 10) Enjoy Linux. You can install, partition, or do whatever. I got Solus Linux running on it. Had some problems getting the latest Manjaro ISOs to fully boot. What you do from there is all up to you. I completely wiped Windows without ever booting into it once. If you are writing a review and you tried Linux, please put something about which Distro and steps you took and any problems you encountered, this helps all folks who want a better OS.

Quick activation, but they're thin enough that you won't notice it. Numpad is kinda small but it's also backlit and the layout isn't bad. Dysfunctional touchapad is big. 1080p. It's cheap, got this for $320. Cons: I'll list the cons from design flaws to potential model defects. First and most noticable is the misaligned trackpad, with it starting at the middle of the left alt key and ending at the spacebar. Not a major problem but it's left me often checking my thumbs. Right alt key is much smaller than the left.

There is no left clicking. Chrome is slow and glitchy, reminding me of pixel slate, not crashing but taking several seconds to scroll down or anything basic. The \"brightness down\" and \"brightness up\" buttons are reversed. Volume isn't though. Back to the touchpad because it's causing more problems!

Lets start off with what I like about this laptop. Keep in mind this is weighted by the low price point: - The display is solid, especially at this price point. Every other laptop in this range has a crappy old TN display. This is the real party piece of this laptop. - The aluminum top shell looks nice. - Processor seems adequate, or dare I say it, almost speedy - The SSD also performs well, even if it is on the small side. My wife doesn't store much on her laptop, so this is a non-issue for me. - Battery life is solid. 4 hours of continuous, medium duty use with no issues and 6-8 hours with lighter workloads. - Easy to upgrade. The RAM upgrade was a breeze, and there's even space inside for a 2.5\" SATA drive should you want to go that route instead of NVMe to upgrade storage. If you own an #1 Philips screwdriver and can remember righty-tighty lefty-loosey you should be good to go. This laptop isn't perfect (non of them are), so here's what I'm not crazy about: - The main body of the laptop isn't aluminum, it's plastic. This wouldn't be a big deal except for the fact that the plastic feels cheap. Really cheap. I'd go so far as to say flimsy. This doesn't inspire confidence that it will hold up for the long run, but so far so good. - Ditto on the track pad. It's worse than the track pad from the Chromebook this laptop replaced. - It's very hard to get the connector from the power adapter seated into the charging port. It almost feels like you are going to break something. It's gotten a little better with time though. Well, there it is. A decent performing laptop with questionable build quality. At this price point, that's kind of what I expected. Time will tell how it holds up, but so far, so good. If you have any illusions that this is going to be a budget gaming laptop, let me stop you right there.

The supplied SSD Hard Drive is somewhat small (plenty of room if you do most of your work in the cloud though), but they do supply a mounting kit and if you need it a YouTube video for how to install a larger drive in the computer.  One slightly disappointing thing is that I had a few 1 TB SSDs sitting around, and the plan was to toss one in the laptop and reclaim the 128 GB SSD to use in an enclosure as a USB drive to transfer files/hold a dev env between work and home and support for various friends.  The included 128GB drive is just the chip on a board and doesn't look easily removable, and wouldn't mount in any of my enclosures even if I could remove it.  So, adding a large disk just adds another drive in the OS, it doesn't replace the one it comes with. That actually isn't a big deal as it saved me the hassle of virtualizing the included Windows 10 installation to run on a VM if I ever needed Windows.  After a few false starts where it didn't look like you could boot off of anything but the included SSD (turns out, disabling FastStart in the BIOS lets it book off of a USB key), I was able to verify everything worked fine off a live CD image on USB and it can now just dual boot into windows or linux seamlessly.

Adding an 8GB memory stick (easily accessible, especially if you are upgrading the drive and have the cover off already - it just has 10 normal phillips screws, no special tools required) solved that, although I did spend a few days just surfing the web on the laptop and using remote ssh into the home network, and after the initial installation and configuration I rarely saw any problems  while waiting for the memory to arrive. So, for about $22 extra dollars for the RAM, I now have a pretty speedy computer with a nice display, full number pad to the right of the keyboard, much more capable than the Chromebook it replaced for about the same price.  My original plan was to just use it as a web browser and an ssh client into my desktop to do development work on the couch, but it turns out my dev tool chain works perfectly fine on the laptop.  It is slightly slower doing a full compile of projects than the desktop, but that is to be expected, and I don't get any network lags doing thing remotely.  I don't really notice any difference while actually coding or doing small write/compile/test cycles. The only real negative for me so far is that for a new laptop (the manufacture date on the sticker says Oct 2019, but it has to have been designed before that), it still has a specialized charger.  I've got much older laptops that use USB-C charging.  So, that is one more cable on the desktop, one more adapter to move from room to room, one more specialized piece of equipment that will need to be replaced if it goes bad. But, for the price, it isn't a speed demon, but I don't play games except on consoles and with very minor upgrades it works as well as any other PC laptop I've used.  I'm not a Windows guy, but I did use it long enough to switch it from Windows 10 Home S which comes pre-installed to Windows 10 Home (the main difference being you aren't tied to the MS store for application installation , as far as I can tell).  I did install some software and used it and it felt as snappy as any of my work laptops (although, that could be damning with faint praise)."}, {"name": "Lon J.

It's all here for a ridiculously low price. Tremendous value here. AMD Ryzen CPUs at this end of the market are just a better performing chip vs. Intel primarily because the graphics performance is significantly better. This means that you can actually run a few AAA games (at their lowest settings of course) and get a playable experience. GTA V for example ran at about 30 frames per second at 1080p. It handles other day-to-day asks exceptionally well too. RAM and storage are upgradeable. You can swap out the NVME M.2 drive inside or add a 2.5\" SATA drive (or both!). Acer packs in the cable you'll need to add the 2.5\" drive to the system. I strongly recommend adding a second 4GB RAM stick to get the best performance. Not only does this increase the available memory it also allows for a second channel of RAM to feed the on board GPU. All in there's not much to complain about here.

When coding, you frequently have to move the mouse to highlight specific pieces of text to do some sort of edit in your code. Unfortunately, the mousepad on this laptop is not accurate or precise, and when trying to make fine movements with the mousepad, the mouse moves in very, very small skips instead of a smooth, consistent glide. This makes it impossible to move the mouse quickly and precisely, because when trying to execute precise movements, you have to slow down and course correct several times when you get the mouse close to where you want it to go (instead of being able to quickly move the mouse to the precise location you intend). This lack of precision is very frustrating, and makes the user experience so slow that I am going to return it. I purchase laptops for at least 2 years of consistent use, and I just don't want to endure that kind of frustration every single day as I'm trying to give all of my attention towards building a technical skill. For those who appreciate speed and accuracy with the mousepad (just like with a mac laptop if you've ever used one - nothing too crazy, just very smooth and controllable motion that follows your input perfectly), I would advise you not to get this laptop, because I think you could be very frustrated with the user experience. As a final note, this laptop also had issues running Ubuntu 18.04 - whenever I closed the lid, the laptop would suspend (this is totally expected; \"suspend\" is just means \"sleep\" for linux), but whenever I reopened the lid, the laptop would not resume (turn back on) and I would have to force shut down and restart it (every single time). I could not find a solution to this issue after scouring the internet and trying a bunch of different fixes for about 4 or 5 hours. Some linux distributions have small issues with certain laptops, so for whatever reason Ubuntu 18.04 and this laptop just did not work well together. This issue was also frustrating and made for a very diminished user experience, although I may have been able to find another distribution that would have worked with this laptop. But for both of these reasons (very much mainly the first reason, the mousepad), I am returning this laptop.

You can easily fit it in your bag and everything about it screams quality despite how low of a price you're paying for this. I can't for the life of me understand why someone would spend an extra 700 dollars for a mac, but that's just me personally.

It's lighting fast with little to no problems this far, if you're using it for everyday use such as writing assignments, watching the occasional (frequent) youtube/netflix videos, you'll be pleasantly surprised at how smoothly it handles these basic tasks. In terms of gaming, I doubt I'm gonna use it for that as i already got a gaming setup. Battery life averages between 5-7 hours depending on how you're utilizing the machine.

Installing a 2.5 HDD or SSD is a more difficult process that I would not recommend to folks who have not done a computer build or PC repair before. At first glance it appears that you can just plug your SATA drive in and close up the computer. This is not the case! You need to unscrew the SATA controller board -- you will notice that it isn't connected to anything! You will see a tiny ribbon cable in the same spot. You need to pick up that cable and clip the end of the ribbon marked HDD into the connector on the SATA controller board by lifting the tiny beige clip on the SATA controller and hooking the prongs of the ribbon cable's end into the slot before snapping the beige clip into place. Plug in your drive to the SATA connector and place this whole assembly onto the plastic sheeting with the SATA controller lined up next to the open connector on the motherboard that is labelled HDD0 (very small label). Take the end of the ribbon cabled marked Motherboard and plug that into the HDD0 connector on the motherboard, using the clip as before. Then you will screw the drive into the two metal rails to keep it in place, and finally screw the SATA controller board into it's new spot. Make sure nothing is wiggling or loose, make sure the ribbon cable ends are snapped in and not floating around. Then close up the laptop case. WHEW.

It works great with Linux as long as you stick with the latest kernels, the stock Debian/buster 4.19 kernel had some issues, but it works perfectly with the 5.2 kernel. Despite being a slim lightweight laptop with a large and bright screen, it is very easy to replace the memory and hard drive, unlike many recent premium laptops that are glued shut with non-removable components. The back cover can be easily removed to gain access to the memory and ssd. It comes with a 128GB NVMe x2 M.2 2280 WD SN520 SSD, that can be replaced with any 2280 NVMe ssd. Be aware though that only 2 PCIe lanes are connected, so any x4 ssd will run in x2 mode, limiting the bandwidth, but it's still much faster than SATA based SSDs. There are 2 DDR4 SODIMM slots, one occupied by the 4GB stick that comes with the machine, but can be removed to install a bigger stick. The processor supports DDR4-2400 speeds. I have installed 2x8GB memory, and based on the measured memory bandwidth I can confirm that it operates in dual-channel mode. The machine also has an empty slot for a 2.5\" drive, which is useful for those that need lots of cheap storage on board, but using that would reduce battery life.

The laptop arrived in a very large box with the laptop in its box rattling around with just one little piece for protection.  Although the box the laptop (inside) was packed in was good, it could have easily been broken. The laptop is a great size and screen visibility is great.  It has a touch pad, but the screen is not touch. It also has a full numeric keypad and lighted keys - both good options. It comes as an \"S\" version.  What that means is that you cannot load programs - you have to download applications from Microsoft (which are limited.)  So you can put on the MS Office Suite, use it for e-mails, surf the Internet and save any documents.  What you can't do is load programs like Quicken, etc.  The version on which you can load programs is the \"Home\" version.  See the comments above.  You can switch this over to a \"Home\" version with no cost, but that decision cannot be reversed.  So the way I would describe it is that it comes kind of like a tablet (except no touch screen), but it can become a computer. I have very high speed broadband and the laptop is very quick.  I also don't need a a lot of storage as I save to the cloud and don't play video games or use anything else which requires a huge amount of storage. For the price and for using the Internet, e-mail, and the Office Suite, it is great and a tremendous value.  It is difficult to get a computer that looks this nice and does this much for less than $400! The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think the difference between \"S\" and \"home\" should be explained to the consumer w/o having to look in the comments section, as well as an explanation that the \"S\" version means you have to use applications and not programs.  Everyone who is not a \"techie\" might not understand that."}, {"name": "Wnhman", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2020", "title": "Great Budget Laptop!!", "review_text": "Ok, I normally do not write reviews as most things don't impress me.

Yes I know this is not a gaming computer. Blah blah blah. I travel for my job 50-60 percent and wanted something to play World of Warcraft Classic on while gone.  Not neccesarrily raiding but more for questing and 5-man dungeon groups.  The performance in these situations is EXCELLANT!! I runt he graphics @ setting 4 (recommended) and my fps was 55-75 in most instances.  Even in large towns with over 40 other players it would only go down to 45-55 fps.  So i decided to try a raid with it.  It performed well in that as well.  If it is a highly intense graphic scene with 40 players I did have to go to graphic setting 3 but still very very playable.  I was totally impressed with what this little machine could do.  One thing last to mention is that it literally boots to a \"ready to surf the internet\" mode in 20-30 seconds.  I could not believe the speed. Overall for use of internet, Email, non intense gaming I give this guy an A+++++++.  DONT EVEN HESITATE TO BUY!!

It's not 4k, but the 1080P is definitely nice to look at from any angle.

With that said, if you are thinking you can play a bunch of high end games on this unit, my advice to you is \"not to buy this unit for gaming or heavy downloading\".  This machine is perfect for quick movement through Office applications, streaming video and for using WiFi and it also has enough memory built in to function reliably, but also to save a fair amount of pictures or music downloads. The only thing I wish it would have on the mouse area of the keyboard is the \"quick slider\".  This missing feature didn't reduce the rating for me at all, as I use a wireless optical mouse anyway via USB.  The quick scrolling feature that is generally found on the right side of the mouse area is nice to have when browsing the web if you don't have a wireless mouse unit.  The backlit keyboard makes up for the missing quick scroll feature though.  Like I said, this machine is a very good deal for your money.

Cheap. - Fairly light, big screen. Keyboard is great. Backlit keyboard. - Battery life seems ok. About 3-4 hours so far without needing to charge. Things I don't like: - The volume is horrendous. My phone plays music and shows louder than this computer. Use headphones/earphones or plug-in speakers.

I haven't been able to find an option to change this setting. - Camera quality is terrible. It's so pixelized it reminds me of a computer I had in the early 2000's. Don't get this laptop if you plan on having video calls or anything to do with video. - The touchpad is doing something odd where it'll minimize my browser and I'll have to re-open the browser when I'm scrolling or using the touchpad.

Using it indoors should be fine and at night I find it to be plenty bright and end up lowering the brightness. The backlight keyboard looks fantastic, no brightness settings so they can be toggled on or off. The keyboard feels great, makes you want to type things for no reason.

I've had issues with my MacBook connecting with my worked mouse because there is no USB port on the right side and the aluminum body often times interfered with the connection to the mouse. The speakers get loud enough for me but don't expect to be blown away by them - it is after a laptop and generally I have my headphones on anyhow.. I upgraded the ram to 16gb and added a 1tb SSD and was out the door for $450. You really can't get a laptop specked like that for $450 - totally happy with this product.

So far it seems *very* compatible with Linux. My bios is v1.06. To install Linux: 1. Enter bios by pressing F2 as soon as keyboard lights up. If you wait until the Acer splash screen appears, it's probably too late. 2. Arrow-right to \"Main\" .... Enable \"F12 Boot Menu\" .... Disable \"Fast Boot\" (Note: I re-enabled this after install and it worked fine. Not sure to what extent disabling this is required/desirable. I gathered from googling that being enabled is a common install problem.). .... I also changed \"Function key behavior\" to \"Function Key.\" That's not necessary, but makes more sense to me. (If I want a \"media\" keys, I'll press the \"fn\" key to get there.). 3. Arrow-right to \"Security\" .... Set \"Supervisor Password\" to something you'll remember (ex. \"1111\"). You have to do this for \"Secure Boot\" to be modifiable. (I didn't set \"User Password.\"). NOTE: I've read that \"Secure Boot\" may become enabled again if Supervisor pw is blank. If you notice \"Secure Boot\" mysteriously enables itself, set the Supervisor pw and leave it set. I assumed the newer bios fixed this. I cleared the Supervisor pw. Things worked fine. But, at some point I was installing another distro and \"Secure boot\" was enabled again. So... it's probably best to leave Supervisor pw enabled. (Just be sure to use something you'll remember. Like \"bios\" or \"1111\"). Some distros will work with secure boot. I didn't try it. My goal was to make distros work as simply as possible. 4. Arrow-right to \"Boot\" .... Disable \"Secure Boot\" (you can't edit this field without first setting the Supervisor password. This field may re-enable itself if Supervisor pw is blank.). Save those bios settings and press F12 to choose the boot device (the iso you wrote to a USB thumb drive). Again, you have to press it pretty shortly before the Acer splash screen appears.If you see that screen for more than a second, it's probably too late.). I highly recommend this laptop for Linux. It seems like a great value (price/performance). And, very compatible with Linux. I added a 500gb SATA3 (6gb/sec) hard disk. I install Linux (the root: \"/\") to SSD. I make the harddisk be \"/home\" (my persistent personal data/files). A second 4gb memory module gives you dual-channel performance (about 25% faster, and 8gb total). But, the single 4gb module this laptop comes with is more than adequate for Linux. Adding memory or a hard drive is fairly easy. Acer Support has a YouTube channel with a video showing how. Search for \"Aspire A515-43 How to Install an Additional Hard Drive\". One thing they don't show clearly is: when installing an HDD the tiny ribbon connector must fit *inside* the socket's body. I took a photo of it. (Basically, the socket has \"ears\" on each side. The ribbon connector has to sit *inside* those ears. Not push up against them from the outside. My photo shows the hinged white part still pointing up. You have to press that down to capture the ribbon-end. Those ears prevent the ribbon from pulling out.). Something else the video doesn't show: you'll start prying the case apart at one of the front corners. (You need a real pry tool or you'll mangle the finish.). Work around the rear, but stop where the \"grill\" is. Then return to the corner you started at, and go the other direction until you reach the grill in the rear. (Don't pry on that grill. It looks like it would break easily. Worse, there are very fine/delicate cooling fins immediately behind it.). Be sure to disconnect the battery (I show a photo of that connector). And, keep yourself grounded to something. (I work next to the kitchen sink and touch the faucet frequently, especially before touching memory modules or exposed contacts.).

To me, the only cons are: 1. The backlit keyboard is a little too cool-white for my tastes. I wish it was a warmer white. And, it times out (turns off) abruptly. It would be a nice touch if it dimmed before going dark. 2. The 1920x1080 resolution on such a small (15.6) screen can make text very small (seniors might find it too small).

The Toshiba one was starting to show its age by failing to pass POST and thus failing to boot. I had used it almost every single day since 2012 after all, as it was my college laptop and even helped me launch my career as an engineer, so it has served me well. But the OS failures were getting troublesome. They were happening increasingly often, so I decided before all my data was lost (which wasn't really that much, since I keep all my actually important data on a home file server), I decided to shop around for a nice, reliable, not-too-cheap laptop I could use to replace it, and this is the one I chose to buy. For the non-Linux enthusiasts, feel free to skip this paragraph, but a kernel panic is basically the Windows blue screen of death equivalent on Linux. My old Toshiba was having kernel panics all the time starting with Kernel 5, so I thought maybe it was my old hardware which has having trouble with the brand new kernel. I tried an LTS version of Kernel 4.19, thinking it was going to solve my kernel panic issue, but nope. I still had kernel panics all the time, and it was starting to get worrying how often it was happening (multiple times a day near the time I got this new Acer laptop). So I feel like I got the new Acer laptop just in time before the Toshiba hardware became unbootable. Now, I'm an electrical engineer, but I'm a lazy engineer. I didn't feel like dissecting the Toshiba to try and pinpoint what the problem might have been. I use Arch btw (best meme 2k19) So back to regular English. I'm thoroughly impressed with the hardware that AMD has developed with their Ryzen lineup and their Vega graphics. Sadly, with all the cryptocurrency mining happening nowadays, it's actually hard to find any AMD graphics card for use with actual graphics workloads like gaming. But that's beside the point. This Acer laptop, with its Ryzen 3 processor and built-in Vega Picasso graphics is almost overkill for what I use it for. I haven't tested any games on it, but I imagine it would run Minecraft well enough. Maybe not 60fps, but still enough to play. I use this laptop mainly for just web browsing, and occasional coding when I'm feeling ambitious with some sort of personal software project I want to work on. In the time that I used Windows 10 S Mode... it was just plain dumb. Not being able to install software from non-Microsoft sources? Really, Microsoft? What are you doing? You can easily opt out of the S Mode crap, but it warns you that you'll never be able to go back to S Mode in the future if you ever change your mind. Like that'll scare me into keeping S Mode! I'll show you how much I care about S Mode. I only spent about a half hour tinkering with it before I just blasted the whole NVMe M.2 drive clean and installed good old Arch Linux on it with a fully encrypted filesystem, so ain't nobody getting into my data. And I can say, this NVMe M.2 drive is freaking lightning quick. Compared to the old HDD on my Toshiba, this new laptop boots in like 15 seconds, if even that. My main PC with Godly specs (Intel i9-9900K + RTX2080Super + 1TB Samsung NVMe M.2) boots in around 10 seconds, so this little laptop is definitely keeping up with the speed. Overall, this Acer laptop is a fantastic computer; probably the best laptop I've ever owned at this price point. It's perfect for basic usage, and I recommend it to be used for light workloads like checking email, browsing social media, editing office documents, coding, and other basic tasks of the sort. The Ryzen + Vega chip will definitely last several years, and I'm happy to finally support a quality AMD product. Ultimately, it's up to you as the customer to decide if this is the right computer for your needs. Evaluate why you need this computer and determine whether or not the price of this laptop would best suit your needs. I needed something I could rely on with streaming, decoding, and rendering video data from YouTube, Twitch, and/or Netflix which is actually a bigger task than people give it credit for. If you don't intend to watch many videos or do anything more resource-intensive than that, then this laptop might be a touch too powerful for your needs.

What makes this such a good value is Acer makes several versions of this. You can spend a lot more depending on your intended use but if that use is more basic you still get the good candy, so to speak. Same sleek design, very good screen, same materials and build quality, and all the latest tech inside along with Windows 10 Home once you switch out of S Mode. If your laptop is four or five years old like my old one you're in for a treat. Everything about this one is better than my old. It's lighter, quieter, sleeker, runs cooler, and the screen is leaps and bounds better. The keyboard feels quality, back lit, and you won't disturb anyone while typing as its very quiet in use. No more clacking! Cons? The screen could get 20% brighter. The volume could be louder from the speakers and varies in loudness from app to app at 100%. No optical drive if you're used to having one, but inexpensive external drives are easily found. No finger print reader or USB-C port as found on the more expensive models of this unit. But as said if you want or need more, pay more. Thanks to the AMD graphics you can do light to moderate gaming with this if you upgrade the RAM to at least 8gb. Quick, easy, and cheap to do. You'll need to adjust settings down, also. Sometimes dramatically. But you can play some games. Less demanding and older ones with no trouble, and on higher settings. I would recommend upgrading RAM to 8gb or more, and storage as well if need be. This isn't a matter of shortcomings with the unit, just a matter of you get what you pay for out of the box. Which is enough for a lot of us. Heck if you use your computer like many to browse the web, social media, stream videos, store photos, online shopping, modest multi tasking, and for school, work, and organization, you may not upgrade at all. I've been using it out of the box for those purposes for three days and have no slowdowns, hiccups, or crashes. It just operates smoothly, quietly, speedily, and looks good doing it. Oh, and boot up time is non existent. This thing is up and running as fast as my phones. I got mine on Cyber Monday and saved $30. But had I paid more I'd be just as happy. If in the market for a sleek and stylish BASIC laptop that doesn't look or feel like a budget unit and with all the modern hardware and software inside, you can do worse.

I wish it came with more than 4GBs of ram, but upgrading that to 8GBs is an easy $20 upgrade or so. Main points with more detail at the bottom: - Good screen, but not super bright. My model didn't have a touch screen, but that's fine by me, I don't want fingerprints all over it anyway - Decent speakers - Good battery life - Good keyboard, typing feels okay - Okay trackpad, can be annoying sometimes - Fast SSD, it boots up fast - Okay for light gaming The screen has GREAT colors, I was pleasantly surprised. Decent viewing angles, but it's not the brightest screen, I'd say about 300 lumens or so. Usable during the day, even with some sunlight, and it won't burn your eyes at night if you accidentally leave the brightness all the way up, it's in a good spot The NvMe drive is plenty fast for booting up and launching programs, but at 128GBs, you'll want to add a 1TB Hard Drive for around $40 if you need to store more than just a few documents and not too many programs. This laptop can do some light gaming, plays light games like Cuphead at 60fps on battery or plugged in. Portal 2 over 100fps when plugged in, and it's GREAT to stream games through Steam if you already have a gaming desktop and a good Internet connection. Otherwise, don't expect to run AAA titles like Call of Duty or Apex Legends with this, it's more for indie titles or small games Battery usually lasts me around 5 hours or more, with the brightness usually turned up a bit, so I can watch YouTube, Netflix, etc. or listen to music and do homework for a while. I usually don't use speakers to watch or listen to stuff, but they can be decently loud, I like that it has a headphone jack and Bluetooth so I can use any type of headphones Trackpad is okay, feels nice and has some good gestures. It supposedly uses Windows Precision Drivers, but I'm not too sure. Sometimes while typing my palm will move the trackpad so it jitters in the spot, which is a bit annoying but easily ignored The one con about this laptop is that the backlight for the keyboard turns off basically 5 seconds after you don't touch the keyboard. It's nice for saving battery, but if you're using it where it's dark, you'll have to hit some random key so you have light to hit the key you want to. I haven't found a way to change this setting or even the brightness of the backlight, so take that as you will Overall, 4/5. Good bang for your buck, specially when it's around $310 like when I bought it, I'd definitely grab this on sale if you find it for less than $300!"}, {"name": "tuffinator77", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2020", "title": "Read this for S Mode help!", "review_text": "I was on the fence. My old HP laptop was 6 years old and the fan was becoming extremely loud, and everything was outdated and non compatible anymore. Planned obsolescence!! I had a Lenovo in my cart for months but I hadn\u2019t pulled the trigger. On a recent search I saw this one sponsored and after reading the reviews I decided to go with it - and I was right! This is a great laptop for the price! I\u2019ve only had it a week but the screen quality is great and altogether, it\u2019s peppy. I do plan on upgrading the ram in a couple weeks just because it sounds easy and why not have a faster machine? Other pros: \u2022Speakers are not amazingly loud but with Bluetooth capability I can synch with my JBL charge 3. \u2022The keypad and the backlit keyboard are also big pluses for me. \u2022Windows 10 is pretty easy to navigate as well. \u2022Good size and weight, slim, brushed chrome look is nice and screen will lay flat. The only issue I had was in the initial setup - you will not be able to download most programs because it is sent in S-Mode from the factory. I didn\u2019t even know what that meant, but it sucks, and only allows you to d/l windows recommended apps. It took me an hour and a half to figure out how to take it off S Mode because what my screen was saying did not match any tutorial I was finding. I even tried calling Acer for help but they had a 30 minute wait time. So while I was waiting, I went back to SETTINGS-UPDATE&SECURITY-ACTIVATION and decided to click \u201ctroubleshoot\u201d \u2014 I was finally led to a screen to remove S Mode. Hope that helps anyone who is struggling as I did because I was really upset and about to send it back. I\u2019m not sure why companies do this to customers!

Good quality", "review_text": "I'm really impressed with this laptop. First off, the build quality is really solid and premium feeling. They keyboard is just right. The backlights are a nice bonus.  I wish the keyboard layout was a bit different with larger arrow keys but that is just a minor thing. The screen is really gorgeous, with large viewing angles and really black blacks. Battery life seems pretty good. One thing that surprised me on this laptop was the graphics. I wasn't expecting much but I installed Counterstrike Source and did a quick test and it gets over 100fps in 1080p. I did not try any new games but just the fact it can play even older 3d games alone is a nice bonus to me. I've ordered the 4gb extra ddr to get a performance boost, that should be the first thing done to this laptop, after turning off windows S mode and uninstalling bloatware. I installed an old 250gb SSD into the empty bay. Wow that \"cable\" is tiny and thin but it works.  Also they don't provide tiny screws to mount that SSD,so I just ended up taping mine in..but it worked fine. You will quickly run out of storage if you do not add another sata SSD or replace the NVMe ssd. Speakers do kind of suck. Volume is too low. I almost feel as though I could probably upgrade them myself if I really wanted to, though haven't tried yet. For whatever reason, as someone else pointed out, the function keys are enabled by default, and not the standard F1-F12 functions. Really stupid is F1 is mapped to \"sleep\" so if you accidentally hit F1 when trying to hit ESC, your laptop shuts down...extremely annoying! I disabled that in software in Windows settings. But I will try to update the BIOS as well. Also if you use this on your lap (imagine that) or your chest while in bed for any length of time, it will get hot. To avoid this, I purchased a laptop cooler which is just basically a plastic tray that allows air to vent through the sides. PC does boot up very fast though. Also as other posters have pointed out, you actually CAN use this laptop for gaming for the latest games, if you use Steam streaming and have a gaming desktop pc. That feature works incredibly well, and I've been able to play some of the newest games on this thing using streaming. So overall still happy with the laptop after a month of use. Highly recommend if you understand at least a little bit about computers, upgrading, etc. If you don't know what an Operating System is, and can't change settings, and can't upgrade memory, etc, then maybe look at a different model."}]},

I've never had a Chromebook before but I have owned Windows, Apple, and Linux systems. I wanted to see just how useful it really is when used as a laptop replacement. I think a large percentage of the laptop community still has no freaking idea what chrome OS is. They were spoon fed Windows from birth. This review will make sense to the tech community, for the Win world - not so much. This Chromebook uses a somewhat customized version of Android operating system. My reading suggests about version 4.4. Before you let that dissuade you from getting one, it actually works quite well. The screen is not touch sensitive, but the track pad recognizes a two finger touch as a context menu - akin to a Windows right click. Access to the play store allowed me to quickly populate it with everything I needed to get through my day. I can work with zip,tar, and other compressed formats, and open almost any file I set my sights on. The one exception was a docx word file. My word processor only handled doc files. I could probably get around this by using the online version of MS Word but haven't tried that yet. Since tax season is coming up I tried three of the more popular online tax packages to see how they worked with it. I was able to work in TurboTax, Taxcut, and H&R block without any issues. The TurboTax version uses a very cool import to take a PDF copy of your W-2 and import and fill in all the fields. This worked flawlessly. I was also able to connect my wireless brother printer in a matter of minutes. This is kind of impressive for an older version of Android but by simply downloading the brother application for printers, I had set it up without hardly in any intervention from me. It just found it, like Win10 does with wireless printers.  This Chromebook comes with 32GB of storage but has the ability to use an SD card for an upgrade. I was able to upgrade it with an additional 256gb for no more than $65. the response time on applications was well within the margin of what you would expect for a normal laptop. Everything opened quickly and applications did what they were supposed to do without any hesitation. I will say that on first impressions, the plastic casing of the Chromebook looks kind of cheap. but then again it is kind of cheap at less than two hundred dollars you're not going to get a stainless steel case. This would make a perfect workbook to take on a plane and get some work done or something to just sit around and browse internet all day. The battery life is supposed to be at around 11 hours and from what I've seen so far it looks like it would make that. I was able to use it off and on pretty much all day and only used about 50% battery reserve. It is also less than 3 pounds. It's so light you can forget you have it with you. It also is not bad for watching movies on. I installed the Netflix app and streamed several hours of video with no drop outs. All said, I think this makes a good inexpensive all around computing device as long as you have generic tasks; watching videos, browsing, writing your book. If you don't need to compile code for your daytime job you will do fine."}, {"name": "THX1138", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2018", "title": "Samsung Chromebook - just what I needed", "review_text": "I purchased the 32-bit Samsung Chromebook 3.

When using headphones I pretty much have to find some sort of white noise to play in the background to coverup the static, or use a bluetooth headset. It's incredibly aggravating at times. 2- The screen. I'm not sure if it's the way I store it in my bag or what, when the Chromebook is closed, it makes contact with the keyboard, and needs frequent cleanings. I'm not sure if it's that the back cover is too soft and pliable or what, but this is a common issue. Now, when I go to clean the screen, no matter how gentle I am, it's inevitable that I will get damages pixels in the screen. I replaced the screen in my previous Samsung Chromebook twice in the 2.5-3 years that I had it for, and on this one I can already see some spots that are becoming damaged. I was hoping with this later model that some of these issues would be improved on, but It doesn't look like it. For anyone who has a Chromebook, I would also recommend getting rid of the ChromeOS and making the switch to Linux's GalliumOS. It's definitely worth it, and will put that hardware to better use."}, {"name": "E.

For another thing. I'm trying to stream a movie. If you rewind or pause or do anything like that, it freezes, buffers forever. Even if you leave it alone and just let it play, it skips every few minutes. One last thing. My email is with yahoo. I know it's an old provider, but I don't want to change it- I've had it for years. The OS makes it extremely difficult to view my email or scroll through my messages. It has prompted me to download it into Drive and open it up that way, but if I wanted to use google for my email I'd do that. It annoys me that I must merge my yahoo mail with google rather than just being able to see it as if on any other computer I've ever used in my life. I have not tried to use it for anything else as it's brand new, but this should give you some idea of what a total piece of garbage this machine is, you can't even use it for extremely basic internet browsing.

This review is based on my impressions after a couple of days with the unit - I may update it later if anything relevant occurs long-term. Testing Methodology: I don't have a lot of sophistocated instruments for measuring the actual brightness, color gamut etc...  In general I stuck to sofware based tests and my somewhat subjective eyeballs. Construction: The top (back of the screen) is metal, as is keyboard and palm-rest area, the screen bezel and bottom are plastic.  This was a pretty good design decision as it keeps the bottom from turning into a hotplate in your lap.  The hinge feels solid and moves very smoothly. Screen: The screen is rated about 300 nits.  Just based on comparisions with others with similar ratings this screen seems like it might actually be a little brighter than it's rated.  It's perfectly visible outside in daylight as long as there isn't direct sunlight on the screen.  The 144hz refresh rate is a really nice feature and allows for some rock-solid motion.  The contrast and color gamut are very effective and pleasing to the eye.  I don't have a tool for measuring the colors so this could just be clever engineering, but nothing here feels like a compromise.  The screen does suffer from uneven backlight blooming so on a completely dark image, there are bright splotches around the margin, but this is pretty typical for an IPS LCD. GPU: The GPU seems to be able to take just about everything I've thrown at it on the most insane settings and I haven't noticed any performance problems.  The Witcher 3 and Darksiders Warmastered Edition look amazing in motion, with the latter running at a V-sync'd 144hz with no problems at all. It pulled a very respectable score of 14,000+ on the Final Fantasy XIV Stormbringer Benchmark with everything turned up to maximum and every optimization turned off. The laptop comes pre-configured with an overclock setting called \"Turbo\" mode which is activated by a button to the upper-left of the keyboard.  You can, of course, create your own overclocking profiles. In order to more efficiently use power, conserve battery, and cut down on fan noise, as with most contemporary gaming laptops, the Predator Helios 300 uses Intel Optimus.  In a nutshell, Intel Optimus switches dynammically between the considerably less powerful and less power-hungry integrated Intel GPU and the GTX-1660ti.  The system will attempt to guess which GPU should be used for a given process, but you can deliberately control this in a couple of different ways.  From the Nvidia Control Panel, you can set the GPU to use for a given application so that whenever that program (i.e. your games) are launched it automatically does so under the Nvidia card.  Alternatively you can tell the system to favor the Nvidia card for everything (not a great idea unless you want to listen to the fan all the time and watch your battery level drop before your  eyes).  And Lastly, there's a context menu item called \"run with graphics processor\" that lets you select which to use by right-clicking on an application before you launch it.  So Optimus is pretty useful for balancing performance, but it somes with a couple of unfortunate tradeoffs.  There is no \"Display\" option in the Nvidia control panel because Optimus dynamically manages those settings, and G-Sync and Fast Sync options are not possible though technically the GPU is capable of using them. Keyboard: The keyboard is, for the most part, great.  The keys are spaced reasonably, slightly convex, quiet and just have a nice feel.  I'm used to pressing harder so my fingers have a tendency to bounce and I wind up typing double letters occasionally, but it's nothing I can't adjust to. (I tried using the Windows \"Filter Keys\" setting to help with this but it's more of an accessiblity option and is too restrictive)  The width of the keyboard allows for the incorporation of a 10-key keypad on the right, however the keys are much narrower than the rest of the keyboard, and the 0 key has been shifted to the center column to accomodate the arrow keys, so it's a bit of compromise.  It's only really annoying when trying to type in a large string of numbers such as when entering a license key. Trackpad: The trackpad is generously large and very sensitive.  There are no mouse buttons, but the bottom of the pad is clickable with the right and left corners representing the right and left mouse buttons. Sound: The laptop comes with a pair of down-firing stereo speakers that are okay for what they are.  They're tinny and can't really get loud enough to overpower the fan noise when playing games.  Noise cancelling or noise isolating headphones are pretty much mandatory for gaming or anything that drives the GPU.  That said, the virtual surround effect is surprisingly convincing. Backlighting: They changed last-year's red backlight to blue, which I think is somewhat more pleasing to the eye, but it's kind of a deal breaker in the use-it-in-bed scenario because the blue light spectrum interferes with your ability to achieve REM sleep.  It's a thing, look it up. Battery: It runs on a 3720mAh battery which is about 25% more capacity than last year's model.  Trying to give a \"it lasts this many hours\" number is kind of pointless in my opinion because it's affected by background processes, screen brightness, what you're doing with it, the age of the battery, etc. Let's be honest though, no one is buying this laptop for its battery life.  Nvidia has several settings which seek to improve battery life while gaming, but they all involve framerate throttling.  If you want to game while not connected to mains power, then you're probably playing games that would work just fine on a laptop with a fraction of the power of this thing. Webcam/Mic The webcam maxes out at 720p30.  That resolution also holds for still images so it seems like that's the geometry of the sensor itself.  It works okay in relatively low light - with the brightness gain cranked all the way up, the glow of the screen is enough to allow it to capture a usable amount of detail in a dark room.  In a normally lit room the image is a bit darker than what you would see with your eyes, and as with most webcams, colors are little washed out.  And like most pinhole cameras, the brighter the lighting the clearer the picture and the more faithful the colors.  This would be perfectly serviceable in a well-lit office, or outdoors.  The stereo microphone picks up voices clean and clear. Network: The \"Killer\" WiFi chip in this machine is amazingly fast.  My Internet service tops off at around 25MB/s, and this Wi-Fi card easily hit 23MB/s (that's bytes, not bits) when downloading games from GOG Galaxy.  I was pleased to see that the laptop also maintains an RJ-45 for wired ethernet connnectivity - it uses a clever hinged port to maximize space while there's nothing plugged in. Hardware Accessibility/Upgrade difficulty: Unlike last year's model, there are no quick access ports - if you want to get at the Wi-Fi, M.2, Memory or SSD area, you have to remove the entire bottom of the shell.  Fortunately everything important is within reach after you take out the 10 philips screws and pull the bottom cover off. Cooling: This is by far the best vented laptop I've ever seen.  The heatsink fins and fans are clearly visible through the myriad slits on the bottom, sides and back.  The fans are as noisy as any laptop I've ever used, but not worse, though when you hit that Turbo button to kick in the overclocking profile and those fans crank up, it sounds like a jet preparing to take off, so if you're doing any moderate to heavy gaming, noise isolating or noise cancelling headphones are not optional. Storage: A 256GB PCIe M.2 drive is installed.  It tops off around 1.5Gbps which is a pretty respectable speed and pretty performmant.  It's not a lot of space though so it's fortunate that there's another M.2 slot to install another card later on.  There's also a bay for a 2.5\" drive, but the bracket and SATA connector kit comes with a warning that Acer no longer considers this a user serviceable operation and implies that your warranty may be voided by attempting to install it yourself. Instructions/Documentation: The documentation for the hardware was honestly a little disappointing.  It gives you a tour of the ports and the keyboard, but doesn't include anything about how to install M.2 devices, upgrade memory or install a 2.5\" drive - these aren't exactly rocket surgery, but it still feels like an oversite that Acer doesn't want to show you what goes where.  The SATA adapter for the 2.5\" drive requires connnection to a proprietary ribbon socket which they altogether fail to tell you how to locate on the motherboard. Other Stuff: I had to chuckle when I saw the \"Turbo\" button.  I'm old enough to remember when that was a thing on the Intel 386 CPUs, and unironically it does pretty much the same sort of thing here. The BIOS is about the most bare-bones affair I've seen recently, with no options for controlling and/or disabling the integrated GPU. The system came with Norton Ultimate installed.  Thankfully that's about the only piece of garbageware installed by Acer.  Microsoft's default \"Windows Defender\" is far superior to Norton and unlike Norton it won't waste a ton of CPU cycles for no good reason.  Windows Defender is already part of Windows 10 - just uninstall Norton and reboot to activate it.  It's better protection and doesn't expire and beg for more money in a year. I've attached an image of the installed applications to this review so you can see what it comes with. Summary: Pros: - Looks and feels sleek and solid - That 144hz screen is fantastic - 300 nits is not MacBook bright, but it's usable in daylight - Comes with fast PCIe M.2 Storage - Wi-Fi is incredibly fast - Powerful GPU - Very effective cooling - I never saw it break 46C Cons: - Blue backlighting is bad for bedtime use - Fans get loud when the system is under a load - No option to disable Optimus and enable GSync (so no GSync) - Norton Ultimate - seriously? Updates: (As I encounter new things that I think are relevant, I'll update the review here) - The USB-C socket is not wired to the video card so it's not possible to output video.  The laptop provides HDMI and a mini-DPort so it's not lacking in output options, but still."}, {"name": "tb", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2019", "title": "Can't beat the price to performance yet.", "review_text": "Laptop performs great. You'll be able to run pretty much any AAA title at Max - Ultra at reasonable frame rates. Cooling much better then the 2018 model and I didn't notice any thermal throttling. You are unable to upgrade the Nvidia driver manually. You must use GeForce experience. 144hrz display is good not great but for the price it's unbeatable. Average backlight bleed which is typicall for IPS. Little to no screen tearing without vsync. No GSYNC which is fine. Speakers better then expected for type of laptop. Fan is loud but not piercing under load. Keyboard is soft but deliberate, great for typing. Very intrusive junkware had to be removed so notifications weren't popping up every 20 minutes, annoying but typical. Laptop is thinner then the more expensive ASUS & MSI competition. The half metal case is confidence inspiring. The bottom is very easy to remove with a few screws and gives you quick access to all replaceable parts  Normally I would not buy an Acer but their Predator line shows quality they have not shown in the past. I'm disappointed it's not RGB like it was advertised on Acers website (cross-referenced specific model #) but for the performance it's not too upsetting. Would recommend as long as the quality lasts as long as it looks good. Edit Make sure your dedicated GPU is enabled and set as default. Optimus is frustrating. But that is Nvidia and Intel's fault. Not Acer's Battery life comments. If you were expecting good battery life out of a laptop you should not be looking at Gaming laptops. There is alot of powerful hardware in this laptop and it gives up battery life for portability. Although I would have given up the 2.5 bay for a bigger battery. Give and take. If you think it's overheating while gaming the components will run fairly hot by default. Even up to 97c . You should really set a fan profile before assuming it's overheating. If it's really was overheating it would shut off automatically. Otherwise it idles at about ,45-55c in a 22c (72f) room. Also set your per game profile. It should not throttle under 80c +- you don't need to use turbo mode. The fan at 40-75 percent works fine in most cases. And is not too loud under 4400 rpm If you think the storage is too small. They placed this laptop in probably the biggest part of the market. You are getting a Hex core processor and a mid-high range GPU and a 144hrz pannel. Until recently you could not get a laptop with this type of hardware for under ,15-1600$. It has 2 m.2 slots and a 2.5 inch bay with provided install hardware.  They saved you money so you can get a plethora of storage options on your own. This is by far one of the simplest laptops to upgrade with 1 pannel. They also sell upgraded ones so you can skip the upgrade If you find that your unit is hitting 90c and above during game sessions and you feel comfortable using throttle stop. most of the temperature is because it turbos to 3.9ghz roughly. dropping the offset for each core will significantly drop your temps. You may lose 1 - 2 frames if you get too aggressive but you can dial it in to your liking. I can game a 70c with turbo at 3.1ghz There will be a small percentage of you with faulty units. Maybe consider an RMA before you trash talk the machine."}, {"name": "Troybuilt", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2019", "title": "This is a nice laptop, and gamer, (1 week review)", "review_text": "I almost cancelled my ordered when realizing the only reviews were all from Vine reviewers!

This has the 1660ti, yesterdays beast card. The last on my concerns were heating up while under load. I am still concerned with heating up under load, but at this point it seems to handle everything I have put at it so far.

Had it for 3 days, and it performed very well. However, and this is a BIG however, turns out that the Acer predator helios 300 series has a history of BSOD/black screens. Sure enough, the laptop froze up and despite spending nearly 2 hours with Acer tech support, there was nothing they could do. Oddly enough, after removing 1 RAM module, the laptop fired back up. But, I didn't buy a laptop with only half the RAM. Clearly, Acer needs to address this issue, as if you do your homework (I wish I had), you'll see lots of issues with black screens/unresponsive computers. Would I buy this again? No way. By comparison, I have an Asus that I've had ZERO issues with. In the future, I'm buying Asus, HP, Dell or anyone else but Acer."}, {"name": "daxsgarage", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2019", "title": "Best \"gaming laptop\" at this price point, full stop.", "review_text": "This is hands down the best laptop, or even desktop, I have ever owned. That's coming from long time AMD guy. It  pains me to say this, but AMD just doesn't exist in the mobile market at  this time. If you need real power in a laptop, Intel and Nvidia are the  only game in town now. I've started traveling more lately so I  needed a laptop that could essentially replace my desktop(s) and this Acer  has far surpassed my expectations in that regard. See attached image.  The construction is solid, and it looks great, in my opinion...sleek  enough to pass as professional with just a hint of \"gaming laptop\" appeal.  The fans can get loud when you're hammering on it, that's true. There is no  free lunch, a laptop must have compromises when they are stuffed with  this kind of hardware. That said, unless you run it in Turbo (read  overclocked) mode all the time I find the fan noise more than reasonable. I  have not found a game, or CPU workload, that required me to use Turbo in  order to have a good experience. It's just stupid fast. In my opinion, you  can't find a better laptop for the money, period.  As you can tell, I love it. Now, I'll answer some of the questions I had  before buying it since there seems to be some confusion. The following  information is from my own experience, if Acer changes things up in the future I can't help you. The is no RGB on this (the 1660ti) version. The keyboard is blue backlit only. For me, this is a pro as I\u2019m tired of red, and I think RGB is a silly overplayed gimmick. If you go to Acer directly, there are different versions with different features. The RAM (16gb total) is 2x8gb sticks of Kingston 2666mhz...it is in dual channel. It scores well in the benchmarks that I have ran and from my own experience 16gb is more than enough for 95% of people out there. It's enough for 100% of the gamers. The included 256gb M.2 style SSD is also from Kingston and seems to perform quite well. There is an additional empty M.2 slot in there. I didn't use it, so I have no idea what will or won\u2019t work in that slot. I decided to use the open 2.5 inch HDD/SSD space for my storage needs. (Please, for all that is sacred, don't you dare put a regular 2.5 HDD in there and hamstring this fine machine). I opted to stay with the Kingston memory theme and stuck a 1tb Kingston 2.5 SSD in there. So, as of this writing I have 186gb free on my C: Drive (it's got all the normal stuff loaded up), and I'm loading my giant Steam library and other big programs onto the 1tb D: Drive. This, in my opinion, is the way to go. The CPU is an Intel last gen refresh (you know 14+++++ lol). That said, it's a good one. 6 cores, 12 threads at 45 watts it tough to beat...actually, I don't think anyone is beating it right now. AMDs mobile Ryzens are topping out at 4 core, 8 threads as of the time of this writing.  I'm sure higher core count CPUs make their way into the laptop market in  the next few years, but for now...this is the best game in town. Also, it's  2019, you don't want a quad core, no matter who makes it. Trust me. The 1660ti is a beastly little thing. Nvidia's naming scheme is clearly insane, but this guy is sweet. It's based on the new Turing architecture and performs quite well. It will smoke a GTX1060 and spit at the heels of a decent desktop Vega 56...and all the while using way less power. For desktops it's a hard card to love, but in a laptop it's brilliant.  The battery is fine for what it is. People wanting 10-hour battery life  and 144 frames per second in their games, pull yourself together people.  Sacrifices must be made for mobility. When on battery the laptop  automatically switches over to the Intel IGP and doing regular (non-taxing)  stuff will get you 4-5 hours. You can force the 1660ti to play ball  while running on the battery through the Nvidia control panel...but I hope  you don't plan on a long gaming session...maybe 1.5 hours. Pro tip: You  want to game? Find a wall outlet.  The \"Killer\" WIFI and internet stuff...actually works. I was getting  stupid fast wireless downloads at distances away from my router that  shocked me. I'm not even going to run an ethernet cable unless I'm playing  a FPS. Blazing fast connection and rock solid so far.  Sadly, you will have to remove Norton (duh) and Windows 10 comes with the  usual fluff that nobody wants...it is what it is. Took me about 30  minutes to remove all the silly stuff and download all the stuff I actually  needed. Keep the Predator App, I think they will be  useful (Update: It is, see below update). When I was setting up this machine, I did log it into my Microsoft  account, and it appears I have Office installed. Not sure if that's because  I have Office on another machine registered to my account...or if this  comes with Office. Your mileage may vary.  The \"Turbo\" button...here's the deal. It only works when plugged in and  above 40% battery. It basically raises the voltage limits of the machine,  while turning on the fans full blast. This results in the CPU auto boosting  on more cores and higher than usual. Oh, and it also overclocks the 1660ti!  Yes, yes you read that right...basically it's an \"overclock button\".  Normally I would laugh at such silliness, but I have to say...it works. It  sounds like a small jet, but it goes like one too. I use it for  benchmarking and playing around...but you could game with it in Turbo,  provided you have headphones. All that said, I'm getting like 62 fps in  AC Odysseus on Very High WITHOUT \"Turbo\". If you're familiar  with this painfully un-optimized AAA title you will understand how  impressive that is, lol. Love that game though...don't judge me.  Hope this helps someone make a big decision. Edit: Update 7/18/19 I read a review where someone was having issues with an echo on the audio. I didn't have this problem as I have an external sound processor that I use. At any rate, I plugged in my headphones directly (1/8th jack) and sure enough...there was an echo. After a bit of investigation, it's from the \"Waves MaxxAudio\" App. This app can be tuned/disabled through the Predator App under the App center portion. Turn that guy off, and your echo goes away. That particular App might be useful in a gaming situation, but if your just watching videos or listening to music it falls a little short. I never thought I would say this, but let Windows control your sound and you will be fine, lol. Edit 9-25-19. Man I love this thing. I travel (airplanes) with it weekly and thus far it has been flawless. Every evening when I get done with work I'm reminded how nice the keyboard on this thing is compared to my company issue Lenovo work laptop. No regrets, I'd still buy it at the current price...very few laptops can compete at this price range. Edit 11-26-19. Still the best at this price point. 1660ti is just the best for laptops balancing performance and battery."}, {"name": "NJBoden", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2019", "title": "An improvement over the last Helios 300 in every way.", "review_text": "After owning the last Helios 300 (GTX 1060) and selling it last year I was ready to be done with the Predator laptops.  The old red laptop was just too big and bulky, and between the thermal issues and instability with the OS I was just done with it altogether.  Then they released this Helios and I'm truly blown away. LOOKS- For starters it is a thinner, sleeker, lighter, and much more visually appealing laptop compared to the big red \"gamer\" aesthetic they were going for with the old model.  While performance matters more than looks to me and while it was a tremendous value for the price, it certainly drew a lot of attention for all the wrong reasons.  This one is a thinner, more modern looking computer with cleaner lines and a smaller profile while still keeping the same screen size.  The blue theme to this is more appealing VS the red and I use it for gaming as well as at work.  My colleagues presume it is a professional laptop but little do they know it is also a gaming powerhouse. PERFORMANCE- The 1660ti is only 7% weaker than my GTX 1070 that is in my PC tower.  It will play pretty much anything at 1080p ultra settings with fantastic frame rates.  Combined with the 144hz screen it is only trumped by my 4K monitor on my actual battlestation at home.  You can look up benchmarks if you're interested, but bottom line here is you'll have no problem with 1080p gaming.  If you want to do 4k you can output to an external monitor.  But that isn't the point of using a laptop. KEYBOARD- It's also an improvement over the previous Helios 300.  It's no mechanical keyboard but it is definitely responsive and comfortable to type on.  The inclusion of a numpad is also a plus SCREEN- Crystal clear with a high refresh rate.  By far the best I've seen on any laptop.  Mine didn't have any screen bleed but I can't speak for everyone.  Good size and the colors are nice and clear. BATTERY- It's simply OK.  You're gonna have better GPU performance with this plugged in but I can see general tasks being done on this for maybe a few hours before it needs to be plugged in. STORAGE- The 256GB drive is an M.2 drive and is crazy fast, but it doesn't hold a lot.  You can add another M.2 drive and there is a bay to add another Hard drive or SSD.  You'll have to actually wire the drive into your motherboard (the old Helios had the port pre-installed) and this is a service that could actually void your warranty.  It isn't the hardest thing to do, but I would definitely recommend taking it to an Acer care center if you can't figure it out. FINAL THOUGHTS- The new Predator Helios 300 is worth every penny.  With improved stability, thermals, looks and performance it is a no brainer.  This thing is gonna be the replacement for my PC tower if and or when it finally kicks the bucket.  If you held off on buying the last Predator due to all the issues you heard about I would say you made the right call.  This is the solution to those problems you were waiting for and then some.   If you're on the fence I can wholeheartedly say (with my name on the line) that this laptop is absolutely worth it.  Yeah it's expensive and I wasn't too thrilled about shelling out for another Predator after all the problems with the first one, but I am glad I got this and I know you'll be too."}, {"name": "Abysal", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2019", "title": "Great gaming laptop, excellent value for the money!", "review_text": "The Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52 laptop with the Intel i7-9750h & nVidia 1660 Ti is a great performer. I've been using it as my daily work laptop with some occasional gaming for about a month. It replaced my Dell e6430. - It runs the latest games at above 60 fps with settings on high (generally speaking), usually much higher. PUBG runs at 95 - 105fps (non turbo), to 110 - 125fps (turbo) - 1080p, high settings. - The screen is excellent, 144hz IPS, and also works really well for Lightroom photo work. There is slight flex on open and close, I wish it was more ridged. It uses a metal lid and features the predator logo that is lit light blue at all times and cannot be turned off. - The keyboard feels decent for a chiclet keyboard, the keys have a positive activation feeling, are quiet, but feel slightly soft on bottom out. The back light can be turned off, but the 30 sec auto off setting cannot be adjusted. This version does not have and RGB back lighting, it's a light blue back light only. The keyboard deck, palm rest, and sides of the laptop are all one metal piece, there is no flex on the keyboard, which is excellent. - The touch pad feels really smooth, but the right/left click button areas require more pressure to activate. - Wireless card is a Killer Wireless 802.11ac i1550 (Intel 9560NGW) - Links at 866Mbps - I've not had any drop-outs or disconnects. Mainly used with Cisco APs and Asus RT3200-AC at home. - Ethernet jack is very difficult to disengage the CAT5 cable from, it seems to snag on the RJ45 connector. Luckily I don't need to use wired ethernet too often. - The web cam and mic combo are pretty standard and of average picture and sound quality. They work fine for the occasional Skype call. - The the model I got came with a 256GB M.2. 2880 SATA SSD B+M key (Kingston RBUSNS8154P3256GJ1) - Also came with 16GB RAM - 2 x 8GB Kingston ACR26D4S9S8ME-8 PC-21300 DDR4 / DDR4-2666 (1333Mhz) - 19-19-19-43 timings. - It's very easy to remove the bottom panel to gain access to an additional M.2 slot and SATA 2.5\" storage bay, both RAM slots, and WiFi mini PCIe card. - The built in speakers produce pretty nice sound, they don't get as loud as I'd like them to be, but are perfectly adequate. - The fans are generally quite, when the system is used for web or light work, the CPU fan is slightly audible. During gaming they ramp up and get louder, and with turbo enabled, they get really loud, like a mini jet, and would be a definite annoyance for those around you. Head phones are recommend. I use turbo mode in PUBG, and it boosts frames anywhere from 10 to 15 extra fps. - The WASD area and palm rest don't get hot during gaming, just a little warm. The area above the keyboard and the num pad areas are where it gets hot. - On battery, I run the laptop in battery saver mode, and get about 4 hours, that's enough for a movie during a flight or several meetings of note taking / email / web. - While gaming I've noticed the battery will tick down while still on AC. I don't know yet if this is an issue. Searching around the web I've found reports that MSI and ASUS laptops do this too and it is by design; supposedly. During the course of a 3 hour gaming session in PUBG and turbo on, my battery drained to 75%. The drain is slower without turbo. I assume after the battery gets low enough, the CPU and GPU will throttle. I plan to reach out to ACER support for the official explanation. - I've picked up a spare AC adapter - included in photo, search Amazon for: 19.5V 9.23A AC Adapter Charger Power Supply for Acer Predator Helios 300 G3-571-77QK, G3-571 G3-572 PH317-51, Acer Aspire V17 Nitro VN7-793G, V15 Nitro VN7-593G Tip 5.5mm, Not Big Tip 7.4mm with Pin - It also fits nicely into Swiss Backpack - J14B-1H-A - 18.5 *12.5*7 (inches) So far I'm very happy with the laptop, it has excellent performance, very nice expandability, is comfortable to use and looks really good."}, {"name": "Evaldas", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2019", "title": "Better then expected", "review_text": "So I'll start with the fact that this laptop came with undervolted cpu which I found kinda strange.

Then if you dare even think about hitting the turbo button the fans go right to 100% and if you don't have noise canceling headphones/headset then you find yourself not being able to hear the game unless you turn it up high enough to drown out the fans. Terrible thermal design as it gives up surface area and has to compensate with stupidly loud fans, it really should be a 17 inch with another heat pipe for both the cpu and gpu or at the very least more dense (or just larger) heat sinks. I've found the keyboard will double some letters, I don't know if that is a fault of the switches they use or what but It never happened on my old Asus rog laptop so that adds a bit to the lack of thought that went into this laptoop.

Acer has really delivered with this laptop for 2019. Just a quick story, I\u2019m upgrading from a 17\u2019 2014 Asus G751JT that has a GTX970m 3GB, Intel i7 4c/8t 4710hq 2.5ghz/3.5ghz boost, 60hz IPS screen that was $1500 and is 8.6lbs. As a college student, my tolerance for lugging that thing has been getting lower over the years. Also had some infamous battery problems that were annoying. I needed a good overall laptop to fulfill my gaming and study needs as I commute an hour to my university and stay there most of the day.  It\u2019s amazing on how far gaming laptops have gone within the last 5 years. Luckily, I was able to buy this laptop on prime day for $1000 which sold out hours after it got discounted. That speaks volume of how fantastic this laptop is. This won\u2019t be a full-fledged nitty gritty review, so I\u2019ll just stick to my opinions and findings on the product. The laptop feels premium. I\u2019m amazed with the build quality at this price point along with the weight. It\u2019s an eye catcher as I enjoyed looking at this laptop when I first unboxed it. The keyboard is pretty solid as it didn\u2019t take long for me to get used to typing it. To be fair, I have smaller than average hands so your mileage will vary on this. It\u2019s comfortable to type on for me, and I enjoy the sky-blue backlight as I\u2019ve been stuck on red for 5 years. No complaints on the trackpad. It\u2019s a little rough, I wish there were actual physical buttons for right and left click but I mostly stick to my USB mouse. The screen is 144hz and it is BRIGHT. The colors look great and the buttery smooth screen is just an awesome upgrade for me. There is some backlight bleed, but I only notice it on startup and loading screens. I do not notice it during gameplay unless you are playing a game with dark settings. The screen is so good for the price that I am willing to forgive some minor backlight bleed. If this was a $1600+ laptop, then I\u2019d have a serious problem with it. Internet speed is good, no complaints. This laptop comes standard with 2x8gb of ram. Although I might upgrade to 2x16gb of ram down the road if I need to for my Information Technology classes. One thing to note is you definitely need to upgrade the storage in the laptop. You have space for a 2.5 drive and another NVMe ssd.  I\u2019m definitely going to get a 2tb sshd when I have the spare funds; which thankfully Acer provided a kit for a 2.5 drive for your convenience. A 1tb WD Blue is a good m.2 drive to get for storage if you need some fast speeds for any applications that benefit from it like Photoshop or VMware. Now for gaming, I\u2019ll throw in a couple games. The Witcher 3 runs between 70-80fps on ultra-settings. Deus Ex: Mankind Divided was anywhere between 55-70fps on ultra. And for fun, I threw in Rocket League and it maxed out with spare performance to boot. Threw in a heavily modded Fallout New Vegas with 30+ mods and it ran beautifully. Battlefield 4 was a pretty awesome experience too.  Overall, this laptop will handle most, if not, all your gaming needs. What\u2019s great is that I never reached above 75c on the GPU and 80c on the cpu without touching anything on the laptop (Auto fans, no overclocking). The fans are somewhat audible; they never got as loud as turning on the turbo button which is just overkill imo. I usually keep fan speeds at around 85%. Keep in mind, my room temperature was 76F. I definitely don\u2019t recommend any heavy gaming in a quiet place like the library, but if you are then you\u2019re not doing your studying like you should be. Look up a YouTuber named OwnOrDisown. He reviewed the laptop and configured the laptop settings to get a nice middle ground for extra performance. Battery life is anywhere from 3.5 \u2013 5 hours depending on your usage. This is with 20% brightness, max keyboard backlight brightness, and some YouTube in the background while typing up this review on Microsoft word. It\u2019s not a long battery life like some ultra-books, but the battery is enough for me to get through some classes before I have to charge which is fine. I don\u2019t recommend gaming on battery unless it\u2019s a low intensity game like Rimworld, Stardew Valley, or AoEII. Seriously, don\u2019t expect any gaming laptop to run AAA titles at max settings and max performance on battery. It\u2019s unreasonable. One minor annoyance I had was the sound. Apparently, the laptop comes with Acer TrueHarmony that modifies sound by default. If you are hearing an echo-like sound as I was, then I\u2019ll save you the 30 minutes. Open the PredatorSense interface and click on the App Center tab. Open Waves MaxxAudio. Click on the Waves Nx tab and disable the feature. Viola, the echo is gone. You can go back to the MaxxAudio tab and configure the sound properly to your liking. Closing Thoughts: This laptop is a breath of fresh air for me. I was extremely lucky on getting it for $1000. It does so many things right that I\u2019d say it\u2019d warrant the full price (Which is currently $1200 as of the time of writing..or typing? Whatever.) and I\u2019d be ok with it. If you\u2019re considering on getting a laptop, this is one of the few I\u2019d heavily recommend because of the price point.

Good mix of portability, versatility, gaming, without going too far in either direction (being so thin and light that it can't game, being so powerful that it can't be portable). This is a great middle ground, and an amazing price. I'll now break my review down into different sections. Screen: 144Hz is becoming the norm for gaming laptops, including budget ones. For me, the response time is what makes this screen feel great. The 3ms response time is published prominently on the listing because most gaming laptops have response times at least twice that, and I can tell the difference going from my 144hz 9ms 17\" laptop I previously used. Same refresh rate, different response \"feel\". It's noticeable faster on the Helios. It isn't color-calibrated or anything, and according to experts the colors are just mediocre. To my simple gamer eyes, colors pop and games look great. So it does what it needs to! Gaming: The i7-9750H is the standard for this generation of gaming laptops, and it's just a refresh of the 8750H. 100Mhz faster, it's basically the same. Not too much to discuss about it other than the thermals which I'll discuss more later. The GPU is the new GTX 1660TI. This is why the Helios is relatively \"cheap\" compared to some laptops touting an RTX 2080. Honestly, I've used very powerful gaming laptops, and they do not feel faster. Unless you're going home and hooking the laptop up to a 4k monitor, which you should have a powerful gaming desktop for anyway, you don't need more performance than this. Even with a RTX 2060, the GPU doesn't reach full utilization because the mobile version of Intel's CPUs cannot keep up with the GPU performance. With a 1660ti, you get high settings in games, with over 70-80fps (AAA games), and it's being fully used, so you know that your investment is being put to good use. Keyboard: Acer did an amazing job of mixing a great feel for both typing and gaming. I have not owned the machine for long, but have reached my full typing speed very quickly. Just mushy enough to be comfortable in gaming, but tactile enough for typing to be a breeze and enjoyable. Mousepad: Great for a gaming laptop. The use of Microsoft precision drivers makes it very accurate, and I have been happy with the feel. Click-and-drag functions are easy to do, not something I can say for all laptops. Aesthetics and build quality: The aesthetic is now a blue, not the familiar red that the Helios line has used before. Some non-Amazon models have RGB keyboards, this one does not. I personally don't care, but it's there. In a way I do wish the logo on the back was smaller or less angular, but having my peers know that it's a gaming laptop doesn't really make a difference for me as a student. The build quality is great, and it feels like a quality machine. Yes, the bottom is plastic, but that's true for laptops costing over $2,000 as well. The parts that you touch such as the lid, and keyboard deck are metal, and have no flex in them. It feels like a machine costing hundreds more, evidenced by the fact that Acer uses the same chassis/frame for models costing closer to $2,000. That speaks for itself. Portability: The laptop is relatively thin without compromising on the cooling performance. It is 5 lbs, and this again is good enough without giving up potential performance. The fact that it's 15\" and not 17\" also adds to the portability, if you're thinking about a 17\" and have to move your laptop often, don't do it. The power supply \"brick\" in the cord is also relatively small for the performance you're bringing around. I can carry the laptop with one hand easily, and in a backpack it feels like it isn't there. Battery life is shorter than an ultrabook, sure, but that's what you should expect. 3-4 hours is enough if you're a student in my opinion, and I rarely need to use my laptop when I'm not near a power plug. Thermals/noise: Acer has done some serious engineering here. I have used ASUS, MSI, and even custom-made liquid metal applied laptops. I know what I'm talking about here. Any ASUS I've tried hits 95+ celsius on the CPU right away even in normal gaming, even with the fans all the way up. Seriously, they're horrible. MSI's that I have experience with are actually quite good at cooling, but they were also thicker than this machine. I most recently used a custom-made Eluktronics laptop with optional liquid metal applied for cooling (goes between the CPU and heatsink for maximum heat transfer). This laptop is actually most comparable to that one, and even is slightly better in some ways. Acer has seriously taken into account the thermal paste they use, the construction of the fanblades, and the necessary fan speeds, PLUS, the machine is undervolted from the factory. From stock settings, the CPU stays in the 80s, usually below 85. Given how Intel has not been able to get past their 14nm process, this is sadly a great result. If you use predator sense software and change the GPU overclock to fast or extreme, you get more performance, and louder fans, resulting in slightly lower temps, plus better framerates, going from 70-76 in my borderlands 3 benchmarking. I personally am a tinkerer, and enjoy messing with settings. I used throttlestop and undervolted the CPU more to -.150V, plus adding 15W to the chip's turbo boost power consumption, changing it from 45W to 60W, and changing the turbo boost time window from  28 seconds up to 40. Even with adding a lot of power to the chip, my CPU stays 77-80 now, with a maximum of 81 in games. This is even with the Acer software set to extreme overclocking, and with the fans in their stock overclocked setting. All summed up, as someone who knows a lot about laptops, desktops, and their cooling issues, this is hands-down an amazing feat. Acer is the only manufacturer in the game right now that cares at all about thermals it appears. The changes they've done with the thermal paste, fanblade design, and undervolting is a GREAT innovation. Altogether, this is an amazing laptop. I'd recommend it to anyone looking in the price range, and even those looking closer to the $2,000 price mark, as the 1660ti GPU is really all you need for a gaming laptop, they almost always have 1080p screens anyway. I'm happy I got it on black friday, but it's well worth the $1200 regular price as well. A last note is storage. The laptop only ccomes with 256gb SSD storage. The included SSD is actually NVMe, and extremely fast. Just plan on getting an additional 1tb slower ssd, or even a hdd if you're desperate. Acer has two extra mounting options included, with hardware provided. You can add a 2280 M.2 SSD, or a 2.5\" SSD. You can total have 3 drives in the machine, and that's amazing for a 15\" option. Upgrading is very simple, just need a philips screwdriver, and there's many videos online of how to open this laptop."}, {"name": "Nathan", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2019", "title": "Brand new computer would not turn on", "review_text": "Product did not work out of the box.

I literally haven't found a game in which I can't run at max settings and still get an amazing frame rate. This is all without activating the \"Turbo\" setting which automatically over-clocks everything on your laptop, and cranks up the fans to max speed to keep them cool. This laptop is very sturdily made, and the backlit keyboard is a great addition, although you can not change the colors in this model. Cooling System- The fans and the design do a great job at keeping this beast of a laptop cool, allowing amazing ventilation that blows out the back of the computer. They can get a little loud when running in the above mentioned \"Turbo\" mode. Screen- Great looking screen. I have no issues about the screen. ---Con--- I only have one bad thing to say about this laptop, this being it only has one hard-drive, and it's a measly 256 GB in size. Granted it is a Solid State Hard-Drive that is lightening fast, I do like more storage space, so I purchased a WD 1TB hard-drive to go into the empty additional hard-drive bay.

It doesn't have the super-premium GPU. No Thunderbolt or USB-C power delivery (there is a USB-C but not for PD). No SD card slot for photo mavens. But at this price point there is no better travel laptop for gaming. Battery life is poor for gaming (as is always the case when driving an Intel CPU and NVIDIA GPU), but GPU performance on the internal screen is fantastic, and the discrete GPU is automatically turned off when not gaming to extend battery life. The 1660ti really punches above its price point in gaming performance and knocks out some amazing frame rates, and the i7 CPU is one of the best CPUs you can get in a portable device. Internal storage is tight at 256GB but expansion options are abundant, with both 2.5\" drive slot and NVME slot available for immediate expansion.  Popping a 2.5\" SSD into the slot with the included ribbon cable and rubber bumper was easy-peasy.  Several USB 3.0 ports (3 USB A connectors and 1 USB C connector) provide ample external connectivity. I've added a 2nd NVMe drive as well. The internal keyboard and touch pad are perfectly adequate, but you're gonna use a mouse + WASD anyway so who cares? Some folks worry about the AC adapter cable sitting next to the air vent, but it really doesn't get hot enough to do any harm.

The build quality is excellent, it has aluminum on the lid and rest palm, while the bottom is plastic. The screen is 144hz IPS, let me tell you, coming from the inspiron 7559 the difference is abismal! you can really notice the 144hz response time. The keyboard is very sturdy and backlit, it has three levels of brightness and has no flex at all, it feels nice and has a good travel. The touchpad is very responsive and uses Microsoft Precision Drivers (which helps). The performance is awesome, having an i7 9750h with 16GB of RAM really makes this laptop fly. I am a software developer and the Nvme included is very fast for such things. The computer can be easily upgraded removing the bottom lid (9 or 10 philips screws), you can add a 2.5 HDD or SSD, another NVME M2 drive or 32GB of RAM, which will make this laptop last a life. Thermals are good, because Acer undervolts the CPU out of the box by -125mV and the completely redesigned cooling system (vs Helios 300 2018) makes this laptop a winner in this section, however, you can reach thermal throttling when having extended sessions of gameplay in a warm environment. I was having this \"problem\" (not really a problem) but putting the laptop on a cooling pad solved this. Battery life is average, I managed about 3 and a half hours using this laptop for developing on Android Studio with a virtual device running all the time.

However, some smart people over at Acer decided to fix things, and the result is an excellent laptop at an unbeatable price point. Let's break it down: Looks: Okay, lets get it out of the way. The Decepticon logo and PREDATOR logo across the back aren't exactly appealing. The rest of the laptop is a nice understated black, however, which I appreciate. Keyboard/Touchpad: Nothing special here. The keyboard is serviceable, but not spectacular, the touchpad is a touchpad. Nothing fancy. Performance: Here's where we get to the good stuff. Any other laptop with these same specs is either more expensive, or throttles because it can't cool adequately. The Helios 300, however, has a newly redesigned cooling system that handles gaming without overheating or throttling (tested on Aida64 and Heaven benchmarks). You also get a Full HD 144hz screen. No GSync, but you can't have everything, I suppose. Overall, the price to performance ratio on this laptop is pretty much unbeatable.  Anything else with the same specs either overheats and throttles (Dell, HP, Asus) or is more expensive (Razer, MSI, Lenovo). Acer manages to hit that perfect sweet spot.

I have few notes over all my use in the last 3 weeks since I got it, the laptop makes an echo when I take the charger out while I wear my headphones and that's a little bit annoying and when you pull the charger out it makes a sound and I don't like it as well, the screen is perfect, but before I purchase this laptop people kept saying that there is a screen bleed on the top of the screen, and that is not a screen bleed at all, it from the manufacturer, since it is pressing so hard on the top side of the screen and that what make the white color showing, but in my case this not annoying at all, and I don't notice it at all and I am really happy with it. another thing that the charger place is different than any other laptop I use in my life which is on the middle left side of the laptop and that's a kinda annoying me as well, also one time I was playing games and the predator sense was working on background and I wanted to use the max fans speed ( which are really loud when they are on ) it didn't work and I had to close it and launch it again and it worked. Turbo button works well and the installation of the HDD was very easy and works perfect ( I bought a Seagate firecuda 2TB from amazon on a deal for 65$ only and this SSHD works really well - also I install it with Justech screwdriver which is also from amazon ). I recommend who buy this laptop to get a cooling pad with it because it get really hot when playing high FPS games like PUBG, Fortnite, overwatch and other games, because it will help lowing down the temperature so much. Final review: The material that used to build this laptop is really good, blue color that added to this years model is just insane and beautiful, you can open the laptop with one finger easily, but what annoys me that fingerprints are staying and you have to clean them daily if you want to keep you laptop clean. Screen is good for me even with the white pressure on the middle top screen on and sometimes I don't even notice it. GPU and CPU are just amazing for this price point and they work perfectly with no problems at all, just watch out for the temperature. keyboard is well built and I have no problems typing on it and im writing this review while using the laptop keyboard, also the blue back-lit looks amazing at night when the lights around you are off, I really like it. track-pad is really annoying as well, you feel like your fingers are sticking when ever you move around, I recommend every one to get a mouse to avoid using it, this the most part that I didn't like about this laptop. sound feels amazing on this laptop, and I can hear my favorite music on it and listen to video's without any problem at all, It feels nice to listen to favorite stuff on this laptop Audio with this phenomenal quality. Battery gives me around 4 hours while I don't play, just watching movies and browsing and it last for long time, but when I am playing games it gives me around 1:00 to 1:30 hours at max while gaming. webcam is coming at 720p30 which is not that much and If you a kind of person that use laptop for streaming and video calling and you want who watch you in a better picture you may want to get a better external webcam.

Thus what I did immediately after buying was purchase a 1TB SSD 2.5 (Samsung Evo - roughly $150 I paid), And installed it (pretty easy after watching instructions on YouTube for this helio 300 model - but DO NOT attempt to do so unless you\u2019re prepared to void warranty - i.e. unscrewing the laptop bottom I believe voids warranty, that\u2019s What I  read, but not fully sure, so beware). Adding the 1TB SSD gives me significant storage space for my games + much faster Laptop performance (faster bootup, faster game load times, etc). Thus in my opinion, the 2019 Helios 300 + adding 1TB SSD is an amazing purchase and I\u2019m very much enjoying it. Will update of anything changes."}, {"name": "mew380", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2019", "title": "Great gaming laptop overall for the money", "review_text": "I have had this laptop for almost 3 weeks and have been putting it through its paces with general use, games, watching streaming videos, etc. before writing this review. ======= Pros: ======= * Cooling is MUCH improved over the 2018 PH315-51 model and comes factory under-volt by -0.125v which certainly helps. * The screen bezel is a lot thinner than the older models. The screen just feels bigger now even though logically, on paper, a 15.6\" screen is a 15.6\" screen. * Has a DisplayPort * All USB ports are USB 3.0 (Instead of 2x 2.0 and 1x 3.0 as on the older model) * Gaming performance is great * Overall performance is great * Boot time is insanely fast on the NVME drive. Around 10 seconds or so, if that. * Screen is beautiful, colors are vibrant, the view angle is fantastic, and the 144 HZ refresh rate is great; although please see my gripe about discoloration of the top of the screen in the Cons section. * The touch pad is nice and spacious * It is pretty light as far as gaming laptops go. I've seen some people complain that this laptop is heavy; but coming from an older gaming laptop that weighed almost 15 pounds... The weight of this laptop is a major relief! * The keys are back-lit which is great for low-light/night time computing/gaming * The chassis is nice. The top (back of the screen) and the keyboard area is metal, while the bottom and the bezel surrounding the screen is durable plastic. I absolutely love how nice and cool the metal is against my wrists when I'm typing. ======= Cons: ======= * My biggest gripe about this laptop is that there is visible light/color distortion at the top of the screen that is very noticeable against dark backgrounds. This is very distracting if you're watching a movie and there's dark scenes, or if you like to play horror games where typically the environment is dark. I've noticed a lot of people calling this light bleed and I've seen multiple screenshots of the effect; but this isn't light bleed (Well, it might be in the technical sense of the word). You know how if you press your finger lightly against an LCD screen (I'm NOT recommending that you do this by the way), it discolors slightly around the area where you touched? That is what's happening here. Apparently the bezel at the top of the screen is pressing WAY too freaking tight against the top of the screen (From factory!) and causing the discoloration at the top of the screen. I can't imagine that this is good for the health of the screen. This NEEDS to be fixed. * NVME drive is small at 256 GB. There is 237 GB usable, but realistically, there is less than that due to operating system install, so there is more around 130 - 150 GB of free space for applications, games, etc. You can load a handful of modest sized games or one huge game (Doom 2016 is around 80 - 100 gigs after patches and Final Fantasy XV is around 90 gigs after patches. Sheesh, game sizes are getting absolutely ridiculous!). That little drive will be hurting for free space in no time at all after a few games are installed. You will definitely want to add a spare drive to put games on. Acer claims that the laptop is expandable with a second NVME drive and a 2.5 inch bay (Which does include the connector you need for it in the package), but the entire back has to come off if you want to put a drive in internally, and you might void the warranty in the process if you do it yourself; so it's not a false claim, but it's a 'gotcha' claim. An external USB drive is the way to go if you want to remain on the safe side and don't want to pay a tech to put a drive in for you. * Battery life is OK; not great, but not bad either. When not gaming it can get about 3 - 4 hours of light use. It is absolutely horrendous when gaming at approximately 50 minutes, give or take a few depending on the game. Although I will say that this is to be expected from a gaming laptop. It's a lot of power packed into a tiny device. You will definitely want to be plugged in if you want to game on it for any extended length of time. * The webcam is horrible. It is -technically- HD in resolution, but only in resolution. The picture quality resembles early 2000s webcams. The video quality is something between a VHS recording and low quality grainy DVD. You'll either want to get an external webcam or pass this laptop up for a different one because this webcam sorely disappoints. It will work in a pinch though. I will note that it helps a bit to have a very well lit room if you want to use the webcam; even so, it's still pretty bad in my opinion. In the end it doesn't matter to me personally since I don't use webcam that often anyway. * The sound quality of the microphone is not fantastic. It sounds like someone is talking through a tin can. Like the webcam though, It will work in a pinch. I don't use microphones that much anyway, so it isn't a big deal for me. * The speakers sound piercing and tinny. No bass whatsoever. This is to be expected though, most laptops don't have the greatest speakers anyway. Use headphones or an external speaker system whether wired or blue tooth. * Acer seems bent on making installing your own OS on this laptop as hard as possible; even if you want to install a different edition of Windows 10 (For example: It comes with Windows 10 Home but you want to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro). It is doable but be prepared to do a little digging and research to figure out how to do it. I would expect this kind of crap on a low end cheap laptop, but NOT on an expensive gaming laptop! * UEFI/BIOS settings are bare minimal. You can tweak a few boot settings and that is about it. It is definitely NOT a power user's utility. Again, I expect this on a low end laptop, not a gaming laptop. ============================================= Mixed Feelings that are neither Pro nor Con for me: ============================================= * Although cooling is much improved over last year's model, for some games, you will want to turn the fan to max. Keep an eye on PredatorSense temps. I personally prefer to max the fans if I notice the temps getting higher than about 75, but that's just me. * There is a very limited amount of USB ports if you're not counting the USB-C connector, there are 3x USB 3.0 ports. Invest in a powered USB hub if you need to plug in more than just a keyboard and mouse (Because who wants to game on a laptop keyboard and touch pad unless they had no choice?) * USB-C connector is data only; does not output video * There is no optical disc drive. Not a big deal since USB drives are cheap nowadays, but it would have been nice to have. * The touch pad doesn't seem to have the capability to scroll window contents like a lot of laptops have on the side of the touch pad that I can tell. You will be making good friends with the Up, Down, Page Up, and Page Down keys if you don't want to use the scroll bars in your window(s) and don't have an external mouse hooked up. * You have to be slightly heavy handed on the touch pad but this may come down to user preference. Personally I'm fine with it and I'll be hooking an external mouse to it whenever possible anyway. * Keyboard back lights are not RGB. They are solid blue/light blue in color, you can toggle them on or off, and set a few different levels of brightness on them. Not a big deal for me though; I'm just happy being able to see the keyboard in the dark. * There is pretty minimal bloatware pre-installed, but it is no where near as bad as other computer brands. I would consider it a reasonable amount to be honest. * The dual GPU set up can be confusing at first. A tip for anyone first time to dual GPU: If you're having trouble figuring out why some applications are performing badly and they don't seem to be using the nVidia GPU; close the program, then right click it, and chose Run application with GPU > High performance nVidia. You can also set up an application profile in the nVidia control panel for your program to use which ever GPU you want if you want the program to always run with that. Despite some faults with this laptop, overall, I like this laptop a lot."}, {"name": "GPTM1", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2019", "title": "Had to return due to \u201cAir raid siren\u201d", "review_text": "Looking for a laptop that can handle my Rift S games. and for causal screen tasks (gaming, video editing, browsing the web) Laptop is very nice, got it on sale too.

This laptop is getting the same, if not better, frame rates than far more expensive and 'higher end' laptops I looked into. I was also surprised by the \"Waves MaxxAudio\" software. I am a big music/audio enthusiast. I never knew about this included software until I actually got the laptop. It is not amazing, but it is much better than I expected.

If I plug in more than one USB device (USB-C + Type A or two Type A), then my externally attached USB mouse stops working and the second device may or may not work depending on the type of device plugged in.  It does not matter if I am using a high end Logitech mouse or a cheap wired MS USB mouse, the USB port is just functionally not working.  Yes, this could be driver issues but, Intel and NVIDIA drivers are up to date and say they are functioning.  So, this leads me to believe it is a BIOS issue. By the way, the BIOS is useless because it has practically no options loaded into it.  I don't know how a company in the year 2019 gets away with creating a BIOS that has literally no options available for edit like this but, Acer has pulled this off.  This also leads to my suspicions about my USB problem being a BIOS issue.  If I could mess around or even determine the method the USB is configured by the BIOS, I may be able to resolve my own problem! Also, be advised the USB-C port may be a USB v3.1 Gen 2 port but, it is NOT a Thunderbolt 3 port so do not expect TB3 devices to work with this laptop.  I can't confirm it is an actual Gen 2 port because, like I said above, I cannot connect two USB devices to this laptop....I don't know why it has 4 USB ports because they can't be used.

The speed difference is night and day when installing and playing games. If you are looking for a nice portable gaming system, this is for you.  If you are wanting to stream to a service such as Twitch, this system would also fit the bill.  It includes the on-board Intel graphics and the Nvidia discrete graphics.

I could go on and on about it, but I\u2019ll just break it down into pros and cons so you can get the info you care about, but the most important thing to take from all this is definitely buy this laptop! Pros: - It is SUCH A GOOD BARGAIN. - The graphics card is a 1660 Ti instead of the cheaper and worse 1650 card, it\u2019s very powerful and can easily handle anything you throw at it. - It ships with an M.2 SSD for the Operating system and storage that is incredibly fast. - It includes a extra open M.2 slot so you can install your own M.2 for more and super fast storage. - It includes an open hard drive bay for larger additional storage, and ships with the hard drive harness and connecting cable so you don\u2019t have to buy anything except the hard drive and it\u2019s a super easy installation. - The screen is 144hz, I\u2019ve never seen a laptop for anywhere near this price that has a 144hz panel, that\u2019s amazing! Once you\u2019ve seen this, you won\u2019t be able to go back to 60hz. - The processor is great, ram is great, storage is great and super fast - The track pad and keyboard are both phenomenal, way better than I thought they would be for a laptop of this price. Cons: - The laptop can get really hot sometimes unless you kick it into the overdrive fan mode. - The overdrive fan mode is extremely loud and is really only usable if you\u2019re wearing a headset, otherwise you literally can\u2019t even hear the game audio over the fans. - The power cord is in a weird place on the left side of the case, it either runs towards you and sits on top of your wires (the usb plugs) or it goes away from you and sits right next to the heat vents on the left side. - The power brick gets INCREDIBLY hot when the laptop is used for more than an hour under heavy load, you could literally burn your hand on the power brick if you touched it for too long. - The laptop ships with a lot of bloatware installed like Norton and other things, it\u2019s not great uninstalling those, but I got most of it uninstalled and then it was fine."}, {"name": "Bernardo Zorrilla ", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2019", "title": "Best bang for your buck in gaming laptops!", "review_text": "Absolutely love my Acer Predator Helios 300.

This is the new 2019 i7/9th gen model. I haven\u2019t done anything other than start setting it up for my son but so far it\u2019s build quality is very nice. It\u2019s all plastic but their is very little flex in the keyboard, the frame is solid and there is almost no flex in the screen. Reviews have stated the keyboard deck and cover are aluminum. This one definitely isnt - its a very hard plastic. There is significant light bleed around the bezel edges when the screen is dark. It almost appears as if the bezels are too tightly attached to the display. I don\u2019t see the bleed much when the screen is displaying graphics/programs/colors. It\u2019s extremely quiet, but that\u2019s probably because I\u2019m just sitting setting it up and don\u2019t have any programs running. Turning on the turbo fan switch makes the thing suuuuuuuper loud. So far, I really like it and can\u2019t wait to see it running some games. I want to compare it to the Lenovo Y740 I picked up the other day too (that is when that one finally ships in late August...) I\u2019ll give some more updates as we screw around with it. It\u2019s fairly heavy and bulky. It\u2019s definitely not a slim design but overall not too bad. Its a very good size display. I had purchased a 17 inch Lenovo Y740 as a second laptop but cancelled it for a 15 inch Y740. Im very happy I did this because I feel the 15 inch displays are perfect sizes for a laptop after using the Acer 300. The keyboard travel time isn\u2019t bad. I love this keyboard because it has the keypad included. The keyboard doesnt feel cramped with the added keypad even though this is a 15 inch machine. Keystrokes feel slightly mushy when pressing. The keys are illuminated in light blue which can be made darker or lighter with two of the F keys. The blue light isnt annoyingly bright or obnoxious like some laptops I have seen. There are a few bloatware programs added by Acer onto this laptop. I would suggest a clean install of Win10 and then heading to Acer to download their Predator Sense program. This is one Acer program you definitely want to keep and use. If not a clean install, do your research and find what programs to remove. IMO, immediately Nortons should come off.

First, the good. This laptop is so powerful and fast. The game engine works smoothly and can play almost all the games out there at full setting, with a but of problem. It gets hot, very hot. Almost 90 degrees celsius hot. The fan at full blast can lower it to at least 75 degrees but this full blast is loud. Like there is a jet plane 30 miles outside your room but right in front of you and not as loud. And here is the USB and other connection problem, still. The others made the same complaints before by the looks of it. If more than 3 powerful devices are connected (USB or blue tooth and etc.) The whole thing disconnects and tries to reconnect. I have to disconnect the thing I don't use at the moment and reconnect if I need it again. For a powerful laptop, it is disappointing. My main concern is the heat and the USB connection. The loudness of the fan is not my concern if it did its job, cooling the laptop.

Spent over an hour with Predator support. I was very excited for this product and will update my review if I ever get my exchange. ***Updating After Receiving Replacement*** This laptop is a beast. It can handle any game you throw at it. Features: Turbo button. If you're anything like me the idea of tinkering and micro managing settings seems tedious. \"Say no more!\" says Acer and they provide a turbo button. With 1 press you automatically overclock your gpu and cpu and boost your fans to get the most out of your latpop! Predator button: Another wonderful addition. With a press of a button you can bring up a management screen to adjust everything. You can set bandwidth priority you can set fan speed. If you like to tinker, this is wonderful. Hardware: This laptop is an amazing piece of equipment for the price. Especially if you catch it on sale like I did for prime day ($999 are you kidding me?!). You would be hard-pressed to build a desktop with this much power for the same price, including a 144hz monitor. Speaking of 144 hz: As someone who has never played at anything over 60hz this is amazing. Its so smooth! The 1660ti makes gaming at 1080/ultra a breeze for most games. The not so good: While the monitor is literally amazing, there are some spots along the edges during black screens. I assume this is just something we have to live with as most reviews mention it. The hard drive expansion, while not difficult warrants some research. Instead of simply having a plug and play SATA cable for a second hard drive acer sends you a cable and a rubber case of sorts. It is  not particularly difficult to install but you can damage your laptop if you don't know what you're doing. At the very least watch a YouTube video. Overall: This laptop is amazing for the price. This is THE BEST budget gaming option of the year. If you want to play upcoming games like Cyberpunk 2077 or have a relatively future proof machine for 1080 gaming this is an easy buy."}, {"name": "Sam Shaunak", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2020", "title": "Average Gamer\u2019s review: Great for gaming", "review_text": "Pros: 144 FPS is really nice.

It lasted 3 weeks.", "review_text": "Edit: So much for initial honeymoon period.  Laptop died in 3 weeks, no power.  Was working wonderfully one night, was dead the next morning.  Had to return it.  AND build a new PC to replace it.  Don't think I'll be spending a grand plus on a laptop again, at least not from here. ORIGINAL REVIEW FOR REFERENCE: Picked this up as a potential desktop replacement (was running an i5 8600K, GeForce 1070Ti with 16GB RAM) and so far, it's looking like this is gonna do the trick nicely.  I'll be sure to update this as time goes on, as I get a better feel for how it behaves, but here's a quick run-down of what I've found: Pros -Bright, smooth display.  Best I've had on a laptop yet, but isn't quite as vibrant as a Surface tablet -High refresh rate means you see more frames per second than you normally would! -Graphics card is DECEPTIVELY BEEFY.  Was playing Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order at 70-120fps! -Good CPU ensures regular functional use remains snappy and responsive. -Mini Display Port output means you can plug this into a bigger, high-refresh monitor for even bigger, sharper picture Cons -Battery life goes kaput rapidly off the charger; if that's fine, no problem (it's fine for me) -Fans get pretty loud when things kick up to keep the system cool. -Not sure why, but HDMI out performance was extremely poor on my 4K display (even running 1080p resolution) -Honestly, CPU gets a tad toastier than I'd like it to during extended gameplay (WoW Classic was fine, The Old Republic wasn't really) Long term, it'd be nice to have a computer that can handle the games I primarily play, which admittedly isn't very graphically intensive, but I wanted enough beef to play demanding titles when the occasion arises, and this knocks my expectations out of the ballpark for this price range.  Typically I'm just playing Hearthstone, Hades, Slay the Spire and WoW Classic on the weekends, but if I wanna pick up a AAA banger here and there, having that option is great, and this laptop brings it hard.  Considering this all runs off a 180-watt power supply, I'm pretty stunned at the efficiency of this thing.  Maybe I'm good to hang up the desktop for good now!  We'll have to wait and see. It's nuts to think you can get a gaming experience this robust in a 16-inch package to go.  What a time to be alive.  Generally I'd advise to never \"cheap out\" when deciding what you'd like to get; this is a bit pricier than some other laptops, but it's got a few baseline features that you should be looking out for if you don't want to be bottlenecked unexpectedly: -GTX 1660Ti/graphics in general:  1050Ti is good for casual use and I generally try to stay away from mobile AMD offerings, but this has enough power to be relevant right now and not be lagging behind, unlike the 1050Ti.  I'm afraid even the 1650 is already behind the curve, so dipping that low to save a few bucks could really cost you in the long run.  If you're concerned about performance, I can not only recommend 1660Ti laptops, but advise you to steer clear of anything below that, and beware anything more powerful due to the price premium (questionable gains at exponentially higher cost).  If you're just playing old games and deck builders, 1660Ti is a bit too much hog; go for 1650 or 1050. -DUAL-CHANNEL RAM.  Two RAM sticks means dual-channel; beware laptops with a single RAM slot!  Even if you get 16GB RAM in one stick, your performance is going to suffer substantially if you're stuck in one-stick, single-channel RAM operation.  PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH!  Single-channel negatively effects both games and normal laptop operation! -144hz display!  These should be standard now; it's a waste to have a decent video card in a laptop if you can't even see the frames (60hz still seems to be standard in laptops, sadly, meaning any FPS over 60 just goes into a black hole).  You'd be surprised even with card games how much a high refresh rate monitor can improve the overall feel of gameplay."}, {"name": "William Bolton", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2019", "title": "Best Value in a Gaming Computer", "review_text": "Granted I've only had this laptop in my possession for a couple of days, but so far I like it a lot. Gaming on a 15.6\" screen will take some getting used to. (My previous gaming laptops were ASUS ROG models with 17 inch screens, and my desktop has a 27\" monitor.) but the picture quality is the best I've seen. The Predator has some great components with the 9th gen i7 processor, the Nvidia 1660 Ti GPU, 16 GB of RAM and an NVMe SSD. The SSD is 256 GB so I added a Seagate Firecuda 2TB hybrid drive for an additional expense of $80. In addition, the Killer networking hardware/software seems to work very well. That's the good. The bad is that it comes with Windows 10 (but what's a practical alternative?), and Microsoft is very aggressive in pushing its services. It can be difficult if not impossible to remove them. I make my own choices for browser, search engine, email clients, etc, but when I removed Edge I got notifications every time I started up on my startup screen pushing Edge and not once but twice. ( I think and hope I finally removed it. I'm not a fan of advertising, and I don't trust Microsoft.) And I'm not willing to trust \"the cloud\", so Dropbox and cloud storage were refused. I've downloaded several games onto the hybrid drive but only played Destiny 2 for about an hour and a half and a little of Age of Wonders III. As I said the graphical quality is the best I've seen, but Destiny 2 did freeze after I'd been playing for an hour or so which I assume was due to the GPU overheating (and I do use a notebook cooler), but I'm also assuming there are things I can do to prevent this in the future. For one thing, the game was optimized by the Nvidia GeForce Experience software and I'll have to look at their selections. I should also adjust the fan speeds, but I haven't looked into this yet either. So, if I should have to amend this review (and recommendation) in the future I will do so, but so far I'm very impressed with what Acer has provided and at what cost. I gave battery life and camera quality three stars because the laptop will always be plugged in, and I'll rarely if ever use the camera (though from what I've seen in YouTube reviews the image quality is certainly IMO acceptable for ordinary uses). Update: On the day after I wrote this review, I played some Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Dragon Age: Inquisition, WOW, Alpha Centauri and more Destiny 2. GeForce Experience optimized the games at ultra quality. I tinkered with the fan settings setting them slightly higher than standard (about 4000-4200 rpms and will fine adjust this more). The games looked great and played well without any problem. The fans did make some noise, but it's a whoosh and not a whine, and for me not terribly intrusive. As I said, I'll adjust the fan speed some more and may be able to reduce it even further. The speakers by the way are great with excellent sound quality and volume for a laptop. The fan noise never interfered with the sound at my settings. Again, well done, Acer. Two months later, and I'm still very impressed with this computer. I installed the new Crytek Neon Noir Ray Tracing Benchmark for ray-tracing effects without an RTX gpu, ran it fullscreen at 1920x1080 and ultra and got a score of 5529 with very fluid playback and frame rates that varied from about 45 to the upper 70s. The benchmark would seem to be quite the workout for a system and the Acer got a commendable result IMO."}, {"name": "D.

The first was by another large brand and was a total bust,  returned within the 30 day amazon window due to serious hardware issues right out of the box. This one had restored my faith in buying gaming laptops online without being able to \"test\" them out. If you understand what you're getting with this machine and have a very clear picture what it is you want out of it, then this is a fantastic machine. The graphics card is powerful enough to run most modern games at mid to high settings with zero issues. The powerful CPU and mid tier specs set you up at a good starting point to boot up and game, literally right out of the box, with little need to really add anything other than a good gaming mouse. The screen is one of the better ones and usually can be found on more expensive laptops. I have very minimal light bleed on mine and it's not noticeable at all during normal use. The keyboard is comfortable to work on although the letters are a bit squished together so it did take me a little bit to get used to. Upgrading is super simple. I had a second SSD hard drive installed within 5 minutes of popping the bottom off the laptop and there is still space to add yet another drive. At this time, I've got a second 500 gig drive to complement the main 250g drive and I also have a portable 250g Samsung rugged ssd drive that uses the 3.1 USB C port should I need even more space. This laptop, for me, is not a replacement for my desktop. It's just a really nice partner to it for those days I want to snoodle up on the couch and game with my dog on my lap. It runs warmer than some other laptops but this is normal. It's a gaming laptop. It's actually quite good for gaming laptop standards. The fans work really well but can get loud so you'll need headphones or a cooling pad underneath to help with that. I use a cooling pad and the noise doesn't bother me or anyone else when I decide to game a bit while watching a movie with the boyfriend on the couch. I installed an app that monitors CPU and GPU temps and it's never gone above 75c while gaming. While doing regular stuff, its in the low 30s and the fans run near silent. Battery is poor so stay plugged in and you'll be fine while you game. When not gaming and just doing regular stuff, the battery might last 3.5 hours if you dim the screen to 50 percent. This honest doesn't affect me much. When I use it, I stay pluggef in. If I need longer battery life, I have two other laptops specifically purchased for productivity that I can use to solve that issue. It's quite small and light for how powerful it is and for being a 15 inch monitor. I love that because as a female who often likes to game while she travels, I don't want to lug around heavy bulky gear just to do that. This little guy lets me pop it into my thin laptop sleeve along with it's charger, which is also a nice compact size, and my gaming mouse and earbud headphones and I'm good to go. Also, it doesn't scream gamer the colors are a soft white and blue and the design itself is nice but not aggressive like their Helios 300 of last year, which I purchased as a gift for my sister.  Happy girl here. All in all, I'm really happy with this purchase and can see that this laptop will last me at least 4 to 5 years gaming-wise because of the powerful components Acer used.

Unfortunately in this case since it comes undervolted to -.125 there's not much you can do besides setting fans to Max in the predator sense application, which definitely will cool it back down to 78-82. I also always use it on my lap with a laptop cooler, which does not affect the temperature for better or worse. Aside from gaming, it also handles everyday computing excellently. I do suggest getting a 2.5\" SSD for additional storage. The keyboard is very good, even though it is strangely placed. The mousepad is a good size, but is hard to click effectively, so I suggest getting a decent gaming mouse. The screen hinge is like firm butter, and the top of the lid and keyboard area is aluminum, hardly seen in a laptop at this price point.

The fans go all the time, it doesn't switch to passive, so it is always noisy, but again a constant low wishing of fans is fine. However what is not fine is the tractor that I now have sat next to me. I'm not a farmer. The GPU fan's bearings (I guess) have worn. Now even on idle it sounds like an idling Massey Ferguson on small jackhammer being constantly operated by some Acer dwelling Fraggle. Again, this is fine when I'm gaming in the evening, but not fine during the day when I'm working. It's 6 months old, it has the Aeroblade 3D 4th gen, a fancy fan it seems, BUT possibly too fancy... I'm sure any intolerance in the spacing of the aluminium blades will upset the balance and cause a bearing to wear out. This kind of thing is not an issue with plastic/vinyl fans, which wouldn't be so easily bent during installation. I contacted support who agreed it needed be sent into repair. But this is my only unit as my backup machine, (that this replaced) is not up to task anymore. So I want to buy a replacement fan and fix it myself. Can I find the right fan anywhere? NOPE. I also added an SSD with the provided adaptor, as a trained engineer, this was no issue, but I'm sure it will give them the option to wag a \"voided warranty\" finger my way anyway and see it sent back in the same state. Acer aren't going to send me a replacement fan... Of course, it has to be sent back in for repair, I understand this. And honestly I'm concerned the fan could seize at any minute. Rendering the laptop a brick. I've been building my own desktop PCs for 30 years, and only now just switched to this laptop as I had to move to somewhere remote where the electricity is very unreliable, and I knew it was going to be a pain in the ass. Every rig I've ever built has been operated for 2-5 years without any issues, and my last one - that just retired was going for 10. This is with 16 hour a day usage 7 days a week 8 hours of which each day saw the hardware utilised to high percentages of their viable loads. This would be a 4 to 5 star laptop had it lasted at least until its warranty without issues. But hey... It is what it is. And if I can get a painless resolution, and more than 6 months out of the fix then I'll update for reference. I dunno what to do now.

Can't change boot order, upgrade storage, or disable UEFI for Linux", "review_text": "I bought this to replace a 7 year old Linux gaming computer (dual-boot, multi-drive) with a corroded power supply, expecting to install a couple extra hard drives, while still playing a few games on the original Windows drive it shipped with. After a little research, it looked like I wouldn't have a lot of trouble installing drivers for the hardware that comes with this model, and the price was reasonably low compared with System76, so I went ahead and ordered it. BIOS and hardware upgrades: Once the 2nd drive I ordered arrived (separate packages, couple days later), I proceeded to install the 1 TB drive along with the 500 GB drive from my old system, using the upgrade kit which came with this computer. Taking apart the computer was fairly straightforward, but because Linux requires you to disable Secure Boot, I proceeded into the BIOS to enable booting from USB and turn off Secure Boot and UEFI. The BIOS password was NOT set, and I was allowed to add one of my own, but all the settings related to security and boot order were still greyed out. Despite installing 2 additional drives, and being allowed to set a password for one of them, I was not allowed to boot from anything except the 500 GB drive this computer shipped with or any kind of external media. I called the support number in the pamphlet that came with the computer, and asked about this, but was told that Acer locks the BIOS on all computers shipped through Amazon in order to \"protect\" customers from changing things that might break the computer if they don't know what they're doing. He explained that all computer vendors do this to one extent to another, such as Apple with iPhones, and refused to provide me any means to unlock it no matter how technical I am. He continued that if I want to upgrade anything, I should call Acer's main customer service line and order it from them, instead of trying to modify it myself. At this point, I demanded a refund because the item was materially different from what was advertised, and effectively unusable for my purposes as a result, but he refused because the package was already opened. I pointed out the product description did not list the BIOS being locked, and based on forum postings about this model on Acer's website, locking the BIOS did not appear to be a standard configuration for this model, but he stated that's what Acer wanted for Amazon-shipped computers, and that they're under no obligation to disclose this information prior to purchase, so I replied I will simply complain to Amazon and seek a refund through them. I did try contacting Acer's customer support number listed on Amazon, and on their own website; after a few days of trying, I did eventually reach someone (average wait time of 60 minutes), who ultimately confirmed Acer intends to limit customers' ability to change boot sequence for their \"protection\". Keyboard: This was a real nuisance. The 1 key, Q key, Z key, and I think a couple others make a distinct \"clicking\" noise when I press them, sometimes don't press in properly, and feel like they will pop out or otherwise break within about a month or so of use. It also has some weird light-up pattern that runs from left to right and flickers a bit as soon as it lights up. Almost looks like something is wrong, and might burn out in a few months. Battery life: While waiting for the 2nd hard drive to arrive, I played Elder Scrolls Online over Wifi a little bit. Computer was fast enough to handle it, but the battery died within about an hour, despite being brand new. Given how batteries decline over time, I worry about how it will perform after a few years. Screen quality: Says it's 1920x1080, but looks a little pixelated, which is kind of weird. I don't know how to describe it, but the pixels look a little larger than I'd expect, and the computer defaulted to a lower resolution out of the box for some reason.

It is so fast that the only limitation in speed I have seen is the internet connection. I have played Middle Earth, Shadow of War for about 10 hours so far and not had a single problem or glitch. It does get hot if you don't crank up the fans, but the controls for that are just a simple button push and it goes into Turbo mode. It has a feature called Predator Sense, which gives you control of overclocking the GPU and adjusting the fan speeds, plus it gives you a history graph of the CPU/GPU temps and processing percentages. Under full gaming load playing Shadow of War I typically see temps of about 140 degrees Fahrenheit. When using the internet, MS word and Powerpoint, all at the same time, it isn't even working hard at all and the fans are just left on auto. It doesn't even get warm when I'm not gaming. I added a Samsung 1TB 870 EVO SSD the first day I got it to load my games on and it took me about 10 minutes to complete the installation. I'm no computer wiz either, it was a very easy addition. I plan to add another M.2 SSD in the future, and upgrade the RAM, but right now I am very happy with it. I highly recommend this laptop if you think it is what you are looking for. Update: I got a great deal on cyber Monday and upgraded the Ram to Crucial's 32GB (Two 16GB sticks) and added a Samsung 970 M.2 500GB SSD Hard drive to the second M.2 bay.

Battery life is not the greatest, but I knew that before I got it. On average it says it has about 3 hours remaining when using it mobile, though I have never used it unplugged for more than about and hour or so. Also, it will not let you use Turbo mode unless it is plugged in which is reasonable since it would probably drain the battery really fast anyway. I carry it with me to school in my Swiss Gear 1900 backpack and it doesn't seem to add much weight to my load. Also the WiFi reception is very good and almost always has full signal anywhere I use it. Because of the aluminum body, it feels very high quality.

I got it on sale when it was $920 USD. Pros: - The 1660TI is excellent. I played Gears 5, Siege, Black Ops 3 Zombies, Rocket League, etc. all at 120-144 fps and medium settings. - The keyboard feels really nice. I'm very picky and this one is quality. - As with any gaming laptop, it will get hot. There is a convenient button on the laptop labelled \"TURBO\" which ramps up the fan speed. It will keep the laptop at good temperatures, but it will be loud. I have a HyperX Cloud 2 headset which cancels noise pretty well, so I barely hear it. If you don't have a headset on to cancel out some noise, it will be too loud. - Great for taking to a friend's house for some LAN gaming or taking your gaming setup on a flight. I brought mine with me for my internship across the country. - Installing an extra SSD is very easy (M.2 or SATA). I installed a 1TB SATA SSD as soon as I got it. It took under 10 minutes. Look up a video and it's simple. This goes with a con though, which is that you are basically forced to install an SSD (or use an external drive) since the given 256 GB SSD is not enough for installing games. Cons: - 15 inch screen. A 17 inch screen is bigger/heavier, but a bigger screen would be better IMO. Going from a 24 inch desktop monitor to a 15 inch laptop monitor for gaming is a big difference. - The refresh rate is great, but the video quality is meh. I don't know the technical term for it, but on dark screens, there is a white glow on the top of the monitor. Usually this is not noticeable for every day use, but when watching game cinematics or movies, it can be noticed during dark scenes. - Very little storage. I bought mine with 256 GB. That leaves no room for games, unless you only play one medium size game. Otherwise, you absolutely will need an external drive or to install an SSD of your own. - The touchpad is horrible. You will definitely need an external mouse, but if you're gaming, you'd need one anyway. It's annoying, but not a dealbreaker. Keep in mind that I come from Mac where the touchpad is the best ever made, so I may just have too high of expectations. - The battery life is horrible. You could say this is a con, but I don't know why you would ever NOT plug in your gaming laptop. Gaming laptops are nice for easily moving between setups, but should always be plugged in while gaming. I leave it plugged in on a desk. Gaming takes a lot of power and you really shouldn't expect to game off battery power.

One main concern I had was screen quality since other reviews were upset at the backlight bleed through and I thought that might be a deal breaker. I am very happy to report that the blacklight bleed through for me is absolutely unnoticeable during normal use and playing games. The only time I see the bleed through is during the start screen. The screen is crisp and the colors are good. I am sure there are better screens out there but this one I would say is over all Good - maybe even Excellent. The refresh rate of 144hz also makes for very smooth game play - I really notice it smoothness on Fortnight on max graphic settings and it runs Classic Wow on max graphic setting very well. Another Pro that will a small amount of software tweaking I am able to get the trackpad to work just like my macbook pro - this is really mircosoft windows adjustments but as far as sensitivity it is almost as good as the mac book - its like an 8 out of 10 (macbook pro is a 10 out of 10) - most non-macbook trackpads are horrible that I tested so I was pleasantly surprised. Cons - these are minor: (1) The number pad on the right is off a little because they put the special \"Predator\" graphics key where normally the \"NumLk\" goes - and i adjacently hit it all the time. I think they could have put that key or switch somewhere else. (2) I wish they had the F keys setup like the macbook pro where I could adjust volume without having to toggle the \"Fn\" key. Right now this requires two hand to change the volume from the key board because the volume keys are the \"up\" and \"down\" arrows. (3) the way the \"delete\" key is setup along with the placing of the backspace key - they are both not normal to a standard key board so I end up accidentally hitting them or not hitting them when typing if I am not thinking about it. (4) the track pad is not centered on the laptop. It is further to the left and since I am right handed it make me have to place my right hand further to the right than what is comfortable. (5) The power cord and the way it attaches the computer. I am soiled with the old macbook pro magsafe connection and I wish this did something similar. Multiple times I have pulled this computer off the table because either me or my kids tripped on the cable. Also the cable has a large plastic piece just a few inches from the connector and it seems to get in the way of effectively running the cable around for me. (6) the usd ports are all on the side and close to the front - so this makes it difficult for me to hook in my USB mouse and key pad and have them right next to the computer since hey overlap and hit the key pad. I wish there was two port on the back of the PC or at least on the side but far back. Overall, I am very please with the setup and my gripes are very minor.

In many respects this proved to be true: The overall feel, the hinges, everything seemed fine...Except the keyboard. The very first day of use a key popped off. No big deal, I thought to myself, it probably got a bit jostled during shipping. Since then a key has popped off almost every day. Not the same key, mind you, but exclusively on the number pad each time. It's super frustrating. I don't want to return the computer, at this point it would be a substantial inconvenience...but I have not given it \"hard use\". It hasn't left my house and isn't even my 'daily driver'. It doesn't get thrown around in a backpack. I haven't typed a 70,000 word dissertation on it. I've written a handful of emails...that's it. I had initially hoped this would make a nice travel workstation, I'm not concerned that it's incapable of filling that (or any other) meaningful role. One star might seem brutal when most of the laptop functions fine. I can concede that. But the keyboard is a fundamental to the operation of the device. It's technology that we mastered decades ago, and it's ridiculous that it should break so easily after very limited and very gentle use. The laptop it replaced ( A Lenovo) had lots of keyboard flex, weak hinges, and a terrible trackpad...but the keyboard worked until the day it replaced without issue.

Gaming off the battery is not recommended and you will be disappointed."}, {"name": "Saad", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2019", "title": "It's the best laptop for the price if you do photo/video editing or gaming/power demanding work.", "review_text": "Edit: If you are using ethernet cable for gaming and it's not working properly, go in \"Killer Control Center\" then go in settings and turn off \"Advanced Stream Detect\". Amazing laptop for the price, really good desgin (thermals aswell) and quite compact compared to last year's model. There is back light bleed but only noticeable when displaying something completely dark/black (for example when laptop is booting up.) and some back light bleed is in all models of helios 300 so don't worry about it. Also black light bleed is not noticeable at all during normal use or whilst gaming. However, if you see more than expected back light bleed, do contact amazon tech help and sort it out. Battery life is actually better than expected for this power hungry gaming laptop with such a small battery. I highly recommend getting a 2.5\" or m.2 nvme ssd. There is one empty slot for 2.5\" hdd/ssd and one empty m.2 slot (with another m.2 slot having 256gb ssd pre-installed). I'd suggest 1tb m.2 nvme ssd which goes for around $100 on amazon. Keybaord is really good, though it comes with just blue backlight & no rgb, that rgb model for same price is only available in Australia. You can get rgb model on amazon but you will have to pay more and you will get 512gb m.2 ssd instead of 256gb which is installed in this one. Trackpad is also better than expected since you usually have low expectations from trackpad in a gaming laptop, where you would plug external mouse for gaming anyway. USB-C port does not support thunderbolt 3 or video output, it's just for connecting external USB-C devices, or dongles if you want more ports. Display is really good, 144hz refresh rate ~ 3ms response time makes it one of the best displays in laptop of this price point & bezels are way smaller compared to last year's model. It also feels and looks much lighter than last year's model thanks to compact degsin and actual weight decrease of about 250g from last year's model. Do enable turbo mode (by pressing the turbo button) if you do anything demanding as it will increase the fan speed, so no thermal throttling, it would increase cpu power limit and overclock gpu to extreme. You will get better performance for both gpu & cpu and even ram this way. In my opinion it's the best laptop for the price (I paid $1200 but you can get it for $999 on prime day) if you do photo/video editing or gaming/high performance demanding work."}, {"name": "Tone3Stark", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2019", "title": "Good quality and a lot of bang for the buck.", "review_text": "Not as thin as a razor but not as thick as an Alienware, very powerful and I can play everything seamlessly from regular games to VR.

This is a stress crack that has happened on my old 2006 Macbook Pro before they redesigned it with a thicker bezel. This issue on this computer surprises me, because, 1)This issue with other laptops had been addressed far in the past by other laptop makers and 2) I expect higher quality for this, a higher end, laptop but from an engineering standpoint, it doesn't surprise me because the screen, itself, is incredibly thin and the top of the laptop has A LOT of flex in it that I didn't notice initially, until, when I went to move the computer, I cradled the laptop in my hand with my finger tips bracing the open top, and to my horror, the screen noticeably flexed. I don't know if this computer has been updated but I just CANNOT and would not recommend this computer based on the build quality alone (which is pretty important for a mobile computer, IMHO!) Purchased 08/2019: I really like this laptop. It's powerful, and it fills my needs well. I use programs such as Premiere Pro, After Effects and Unity and I also play games like Apex Legends and Fortnite on it. This computer handles these tasks well. There are few things that really annoy me about this laptop. The keyboard is off center by A LOT. I'm constantly hitting the Predator button when I code and it gets to be incredibly annoying as time wears on. I don't use the number pad often, if ever, so I could have done without it and that would have helped with the centering of the keyboard. The shift key on the right is also too small. The second thing that bothers me is the speaker(s). They are in the front of the computer so if the computer is on your lap, the sound will probably be quite muffled. When it's on a hard surface, it sounds better but the sound itself is not of great quality. For reference, my 2012 MacBook Air's speakers have a more full sound and are head and shoulders above the speakers in this laptop. The third thing that bothers me is the fact that the computer cannot adjust brightness appropriately, automatically, when it's removed from AC power (my MacBook Air does). The same goes for when you plug in headphones or unplug them: there is no separate volume for headphones vs. the laptop's speaker. These are things I can generally look past but they bother me enough to keep them in the back of my mind when buying another laptop."}, {"name": "Jordon", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2019", "title": "Great computer for the price - Good review", "review_text": "So I\u2019ve always been a competitive laptop gamer and always want the latest and greatest. I spend many many days researching trying to find that perfect computer and this was a great option. Let me go through the pros and cons... Pros: 144hz screen - never actually had anything over 60hz because it\u2019s hard to get anything higher for cheap so this was a great treat and is buttery smooth. 1660 Ti - probably the main reason a lot of people get this laptop, the graphics card is great, it\u2019s relatively new, has 6gb memory. This card will run circles around the 1050ti and gives desktop GPUs a run for there money. CPU - has a great cpu which is very easily over clockabke via the settings, you can set the speed, fan speed and more. Small bezels - compared to some the bezels on this are quite good, the sides and top are narrow, bottom isn\u2019t too bad at all. Overall a nice size screen for viewing. Keyboard - mine only had a blue black light which is okay because I love blue. The keyboard feels good, nice quality and not too loud. Cons: Battery life is poor - can\u2019t get much use out of it but how often are you not near an outlet Light up logo on lid - really wish you could turn it off makes it look kinda cheesy and gamey, not super professional. All in all this is a great laptop for the money. So should you get this? Well if you want a laptop that is pretty sleek, fast, and can run almost any game on the market at high 60fps or higher. People do mention bad screen bleed, either I got a lucky unit or they are over exaggerating because I have very little if any. I do recommend a ssd addition the 256gb stock is small. There is an option for both a m.2 ssd and or a 2.5\u201d drive. Plenty of room to add storage.

The laptop was in my amazon list for a long time and I finally pulled the trigger at the start of the Covid-19 outbreak. Pros: Gaming- This is what this computer is made for. It seemingly can handle most gaming tasks at recommended settings Screen- The screen is really nice but I do wish it was a little brighter.  However, the screen quality seems top notch in my limited testing of the unit. Keyboard- The keyboard seems really nice. Button feel nice and typing on the laptop is nice and easy. Form Factor- Surprisingly, the computer is relatively slim and lightweight considering the amount of power the unit has. Cons Battery Life- The battery drains quick. This should be expected considering the computer is relatively high-powered and designed for gaming. Design- I hate the design of the computer. It really screams \"GAMING\" with the design. I wish it was more subtle because I am a working professional and I don't like the design. Sound- HOLY MOLY this unit gets really loud and hot! Just playing WoW for about 10 minutes and it starts to cook and the fans get loud. If turbo is enabled then it is insanely loud. Heat- When I purchased this machine I fully anticipated it to get hot but the heat near your fingers is really warm. Right above the function buttons near the turbo button gets extremely hot. Speakers- Sub par and hugely disappointing. Do not get this computer if you need quality built in speakers. Overall, I do like this machine and it does exactly what I needed it to do. The screen is amazing and the performance is really strong and I feel like it will handle most games you throw at it with ease.

Having an ISP screen that can do 144Hz is a grate thing to have on a laptop.

(I do intensive CPU and GPGPU computations.) I have used this laptop for a few months now. Good things: - Good thermal performance. Has the option to quiet the fan in an office or library setting, but has the CoolBoost feature to provide some additional RPM. Even so, I'm using a cooling pad. The CPU is 6 cores so anything that is CPU-intensive will need to have more heat dissipated than a 4 core laptop with the same chassis. They undervolted from the factory which definitely helps cool it down by a few degrees. I really appreciate how quiet it is. It will almost certainly not draw attention in a quiet room. Of course, don't take it for granted - a high ambient temperature will easily nullify all these gains. - The boot time is consistently about 5-6 seconds. Much better than the 15 seconds my previous laptop had even after I replaced its hard drive with an SSD. You can use the PredatorSense software to disable the sound during boot time. Worth noting: - Keyboard keys. I would have preferred a dedicated power button off to the side instead of it being part of the keyboard. I have not accidentally pressed it while cleaning the keyboard but it is of note. As someone who uses the number pad quite frequently, the placement of the right arrow and the 0 key might take a bit of getting used to. The keys themselves have good action through and I have not had any problems with key presses. The sides are white and the WASD and arrow keys have a blue edge to them, which is much better than the red theme of the previous laptop. The backlit is fine but I do not use it at all - the white sides already help with visibility. - Bloatware. As usual, uninstall all the garbage that comes with it. There are a few that you might not want to uninstall, especially the PredatorSense software (activated by the key next to NumLock). I also make sure to regularly clear space, especially after a Windows update. The default storage is 256 GB so it will quickly fill up. - Battery. I have gotten a rather wide variation of battery life. It is definitely not designed to be long-lasting 8-10 hours; you will need to bring your charger for extended periods. Tips to save battery life apply to every laptop. Most important is to dim the screen as much as possible and to minimize the time of tasks that end up increasing RPM, including surfing the web (note the high CPU and RAM usage by Firefox, Chrome, etc; and no videos, streaming!). Unlike my previous laptop, you have to take the bottom lid to expose the battery so you cannot replace it with a larger one. - External monitor. The HDMI works, but if you have a 60 Hz monitor, the laptop screen will also go down to 60 Hz if a video is playing on the monitor, such as a Twitch stream or a YouTube video. If, on the monitor screen, you go to a different tab, you get back 144 Hz on the laptop. The 144 Hz is very smooth and it adds a lot to the experience. - Webcam. Somehow something got messed up during initial configuration, and very early on, the webcam light turned on whenever I watched a video on YouTube. Very strange, almost like the NSA was spying on me. Luckily I do not use the webcam at all and disabled it. For those that do, make sure you fidget around with the settings until it works. - Audio. The speakers are not great, use a headset. And DO make sure to uncheck the \"Enable audio enhancements,\" which may be on by default and produces a much worse sound than if it were disabled. Even a tone-deaf person can tell the difference. Not sure why the option even exists, to be honest. Nitpicks: - Outer design. I don't mind the logo, but I wish that they removed the blue streaks, which detract from a professional look. In terms of bringing this laptop to a meeting or other professional setting, it's on the edge between sleek and tacky, in my opinion. It can be mitigated by putting on some laptop stickers for those who are into that. I have noticed much criticism on the internet about the flashy looks of most gaming laptops, but frankly, I wouldn't be too self-conscious about how your laptop looks. - There is a weird thing where the screen flashes red for a few frames before returning to normal every time it brings up the login screen. This happens both upon startup and after pressing Windows-L. I do not know what is causing this but it is slightly annoying. - There is a moderately loud beep that sometimes happens when I plug in the charger before turning the laptop on or while it is booting, or awaking the laptop from sleep. Also slightly annoying. The loudness of the beep seems to be independent of the speaker volume. Overall, great laptop and great value too. Don't be dissuaded by the number of cons vs. pros in my list, they are very minor compared to all the great things that this device offers."}, {"name": "FromSpace", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2019", "title": "IF YOU GET WEIRD ECHO/SURROUND AUDIO", "review_text": "This is a tip for people that encourage an issue that I did.

It reached 45 Celsius quickly. So I wonder how it would do under heavy load... Overall, it's a decent machine for the price. Most other laptops in this range are underpowered. Build quality is decent. Not as fancy as my older MSI laptop which this replaced, but it seems good, and it's $600 cheaper than my MSI was. Unlike MSI, Acer (mostly) put the keys in the right places. (Ever use MSI? Super annoying layout and Fn key combos for a developer editing code.) The BIOS is limited (not much you can do there) and the components aren't really high end, just some obscure name. I immediately upgraded the RAM to 32gb (it has two slots) and the SSD to a 500gb M.2 NVMe Samsung. (Swapped parts with the previous laptop.) Then I made it a Linux laptop, which wasn't too difficult. It works fine with Ubuntu 19.10 and the latest Nvidia driver. No weird compatibility issues so far, even though Acer only supports Windows on this machine. You won't find Acer drivers or PredatorSense, but I've run this a few hours on Ubuntu without any issues. The screen looks good. There is very noticeable backlight bleeding on black backgrounds, but it's not an issue otherwise. Bottom line: you get respectable specs for the price. Battery life is terrible at about 90 minutes. Maybe 2 hours max, but no gaming laptop will run very long on battery. Still, I feel it should be a 6-cell, not 4.

This has to be the best \"bang for the buck\" machine that I have ever purchased.  The 10th gen 1035G1 i5 is obscenely fast when mixed with the 16gb ddr4 and the 1/2 TB NVMe sdd.  This is elegant as anything as well.  A beautiful chassis.  I was surprised by how light it is.  I guess that is to be expected since I think everything except for the cpu fan is solid state.  The onboard camera is very clear and a driver license text is legible for secure websites.  The CPU includes neural net instructions from the Xeon line for the first time for consumer in the 10th gen chips.  If you are doing data science with development suites like Anaconda using Jupyter notebooks or working with Netbeans or using a MySQL instance for learning this is blazing fast for a great price. In a nutshell, this offers Windows workstation performance with Chromebook simplicity/pricing. *update* Well I bought this on Dec 16th 19', so I figured an update was in order.  It is still running strong and I think that I have put it through its paces particularly on Steam gaming.  Some might say that the UHD G1 graphics are a bit \"light in the loafers\" I think that it is fine for the 1366x768p screen.  I got the latest \"Resident Evil\" demo to run albeit at mild settings but it still looked spectacular and acceptable frame rates. Some other newer titles like Destiny 2 will probably be a bit much rendered on the machine.  For older stuff like Portal2 you can run maxed out. The Intel 660p QLC drive is also really good i think for the price. Through installing and deleting I have about 2TB worth of mileage on the drive, still very fast, no wear according to S.M.A.R.T. I have not had any issues with the wi-fi on my unit.  I know it is not the fastest solution out there but on my Asus AC1300 router I get 325mbps from a different floor of the house the hypotenuse length being about 20-25 through a floor and a wall.  I can game on Google Stadia and download a series of torrents and keep my Comcast 100mbps service relatively transmitting a lot of data for hours with no drop-offs on the Wi-Fi.  Now granted I am stationary, I'm not jumping from tabletop to tabletop confusing the beam-forming of the router. So, it a solid performer that can handle some pretty heavy stuff thrown at it. *end of update*"}, {"name": "Danny Nguyen", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2020", "title": "2020 HP 15 15.6\" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop", "review_text": "Key Points: - A cheap deal for a competitive performance laptop - Thin & Lightweight (Easy to carry) - Large storage space for basically any consumer need - Comes with HP Customer Service application on set-up (1-year warranty) Experience: If you're like me, you hate to buy something without the full confidence in the product first. Believe me, it's difficult sometimes to buy things online due to the limitation of only being able to rely on other customer's reviews before the product is purchased and arrives at your doorstep. However, I have a pretty positive outlook on this laptop for its price. I attached a few photos to showcase its exterior mechanisms, as well as showcase a general size of what laptop to expect in real-world size (as opposed to reading numbers and expecting to visualize that in your head). The laptop is about 23cm length by 35-36cm width with a thickness of 1.5 cm. The weight is as advertised, it's comfortable to carry around and will fit in thin spaces; it won't occupy too much room in a backpack or luggage. For its technical aspects, I used a free CPU test online called UserBenchmark to compare its performance to other users who also documented their computers/laptops. (This provides a bias as it only takes into account for users who test their computers on that specific software, but it's still a good comparison to get a general idea of the performance the laptop provides.) Attached also is the report containing simplified and relevant data to its specifications. Its computing power is where this computer shines the most, as it performs in the top 75%+ percentile, which is what most consumers will desire, as GPU is of less importance in that they don't intend to purchase a cheaper laptop with the intentions to play heavier & more demanding video games on it. I was actually pleasantly surprised to hear of a lower pricing laptop that came with 16GB of RAM, which is almost unheard of for this price range, and although I didn't document how much free space was available upon receiving and setting it up, there is still ~400+ GB available after transferring the bulk of my applications and user data from my old laptop. For the price it's set at, I personally think it's a great deal since its competitors will often price the same specifications for almost twice the price. As a side note, HP doesn't load the computer with so many useless applications as Lenovo does that the consumer will more than likely never use... (occupying memory). Overall, very happy & satisfied with my purchase, I would thoroughly recommend it, and I look forward to programming code with this laptop."}, {"name": "Josh", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2020", "title": "WiFi adapter will CONSTANTLY disconnect.

Don't take my word for it either, do some Google searches on it! Put in the part name + \"disconnect\" and issues come up in abundance. There are a multitude of threads on HPs own website, dating back from 2018 even, about how this WiFi adapter constantly disconnects or misbehave. The \"solutions\" that HP gives to to download a specific driver. Click the link and the file does not exist! And that's if you're able to get that far before the chip disconnects. The first 3 solutions I checked out did this, I'm not going to waste any more time with it right now. Summary: good specs, but the WiFi chip constantly disconnects, even requiring restart to fix it. Happens instantly after reboot sometimes. Stay away from this product until a fix for the WiFi chip is implemented. Planning on returning this headache of a computer unless I can find a fix.

MANUFACTURING - The laptop is made of plastic , quality is good but Could not compete metal body. Moreover , I love the design of screen , almost minimum bezel and it gives a premium look. Keyboard keys are smooth.I sometimes face a little issues with touchpad sometimes it stuck or hangs maybe i can call it less sensitive that isn't a big issue to worry also the touchscreen works really fine , no worries at all. There are no lights under keyboard pads,so it makes it difficult to type in dark. PERFORMANCE- This laptop starts pretty fast in almost under 20 secs, it will boot up and take you to desktop. I played Asphalt 9 on this laptop on the very first day and it played smoothly  , and you can play other games also but problem will be that it will be in low quality due to less resolution of screen otherwise processor has no problem in running games (for more information you can search for processor details on google according to your priorities).I would not recommend for gaming purposes. THINGS TO NOTE- Since this product is available from third party you won\u2019t be getting 12 months warranty cause they upgrade the laptop and then deliver further, in my case i got 9 months of warranty. Laptop is quite slim and gives a quite unique look. No problem with wifi and battery (4-5hrs on screen battery backup).

So in 1 month I'm not going to get annoying pop - ups asking me to pay for it. It's the first time I've had touch screen.  I didn't think I needed it, and probably wouldn't except that I am not teaching a graphic design class and the touch screen is very helpful.  Instead of using the mouse pad to draw I can use the screen, which is more accurate.  I wish the screen laid flat for tablet mode so that I could draw more easily.  but, hey, I didn't know I needed it and HP would most likely charge more for that. Only one complaint.  The construction wasn't well thought out.  The keyboard sits in a tray so there is a bezel around it.  It is constantly scratching at my wrists as I type.  Look carefully at the picture you can see that the silver underneath wraps up around the black keyboard UPDATE: 2 months into owning this computer and I'm still impressed by the speed.  Still hating the construction of the computer.  It's cheaply built but I'm ok with that because the inside is awesome.  I also found that the mic seems to be directional.  Doing a lot of virtual now and I find if I'm not directly in front of the computer, people say they can't hear me.  I think it needs an external mic.  The screen quality can be better.

You are basically getting a mid level laptop with some premium features at a bargain bin price. Pros- Battery life is good to borderline impressive. For typical typing and internet surfing your getting a good 6+ hours. The touch screen is very good and excellent for scrolling documents or zooming pictures in an intuitive way. The processor / RAM / SSD combo make it very fast. The screen is bright and has a \"glassy\" feel to it. The keyboard is very \"clicky\" and comfortable. The laptop physically feels very \"solid\" and not cheap and plasticy. Cons- I will caveat the cons with theyre all to be expected based on the item description- and when you consider the price (I paid $525) its well within expectations. The resolution is not \"real\" HD- its 1366x768. The fan can be a bit loud at times, not obnoxious \"ten year old Pentium laptop\" old- but a bit louder than you'd expect for something this modern. The integrated graphics is pretty meh. I got a few older but still modern games like Fallout 4 and Deus Ex to play okay but this definitely isn't a gaming laptop.

Because, there ARE only (2) USB-3 ports and (1) USB-C port and (1) HDMI port and (1) headphone/speaker jack AND (1) SD card slot (not mentioned anywhere that I can see)...and unless I am confused (which can be the case)...there is no \"Display Port\". I think I get it that one of the (3) USB-3's listed IS the USB-C but I also do not understand no mention of an SD card slot and the listing of a \"DisplayPort\".

I wasn't expecting much from a $500 laptop but just needed something to get me reconnected. Setup was a breeze, setting it to my preferences was simple, removing the (modest) bloatware from Acer was easy and I was pleasantly surprised at the quickness of the unit. The memory and drive appear to be easily and inexpensively upgradeable but it functions flawlessly right out of the box. I wasn't paying for or expecting gaming-quality graphics but the display renders internet and video perfectly. Those that find fault with this unit must be comparing it to others costing 2 to 3 times as much. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking a laptop to take care of their basic computing needs. Very nice product for the money. Well done, Acer. Update from 10 days later:  Been using it relentlessly and comparing it to my desktop, which had far more memory, storage and graphics capabilities, and I am honestly thrilled. I was thinking of using this as a bridge-unit until I could go back to a new desktop but am seriously rethinking that. The thing that really impresses me is the boot-time. This guy goes from powered down to browsing in about 30 seconds. Not sure if that's just the SSD or newer CPU but I am loving it. Pretty sure I'm going to start using this as my main and adding a docking station, keyboard/mouse (of course), monitor, a bit more memory and storage, and just rolling with it. Disclaimer: I am not a gamer and I understand this machine won't do complex graphics. Update 2: Just to see if it would work, I installed a $65 16GB memory card to bring the total RAM to 20GB, the maximum Acer allows for the unit (it comes with 8GB but you have to remove a 4GB card to upgrade). It worked flawlessly and it is now far zippy-er than my Dell. From what I've read, the extra memory allows it to run cooler and hopefully adds to its service life. Update 3 (I promise this is the last). Thrilled with this little budget-monkey. Restart time, 25-30 seconds. Startup from shut down (not sleep), 12-15 seconds including pin-entry time. Kicking it up to 20GB memory really helped. For anyone that wants to try this stunt (and possibly void the warranty) all it takes is a plastic spudger (google it) and a small Phillips head screwdriver to take the back of the laptop off. 16GB memory cards are readily available from Crucial and Memorystock, usually on Amazon. The video that gave me confidence to try it was on YouTube but it showed how to add a hard drive, not a memory card. Older Acers had a removable panel over the memory but on the  Acer Aspire 5 A515-54-51DJ, you have to take off the whole back. Don't even try it if you are confused about which end of a screwdriver to use or never read instructions. A final note about some of the drama-queen reviewers that complained that \"it gets so hot\" or \"the fan sounds like a 747 taking off\": Just because it's called a laptop doesn't mean you should use it on your lap covered with your fleece blanket blocking the air vents. Use mine on my desk and on the rare occasions that the fan kicks on under heavy use it makes a gentle whirring sound, barely noticeable. If it died tomorrow, I'd buy another. Loving it Update 4 (OK, I lied).  After upgrading the memory and performing every performance-enhancing trick I could find on the internet with Windows, apps, settings and everything else, I started testing my budget computer. The most comprehensive free test I found was from UserBenchMark and I was kinda proud of the results. The test results can vary depending on the state of the computer but here was my best test (the others were pretty close): \"Overall this PC is performing way above expectations (95th percentile). This means that out of 100 PCs with exactly the same components, 5 performed better. The overall PC percentile is the average of each of its individual components. This PC is likely operated by a technical master!\" Did you hear that? I'm a technical master!  All kidding aside, this $500 budget unit is working so far above my previous desktop that I'll never go back (sorry, Dell). I read that the average laptop only lasts 3-5 years before needing replacement. I'm OK with that and my next unit is definitely going to be a graphics-improved version of this machine, hopefully Acer. Totally pleased."}, {"name": "ttview", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2019", "title": "Terrible.", "review_text": "The fan noise on this laptop is so bad that when you first hear it you're going to think your next door neighboor is using a leaf blower outside. I DARE you to tell me i'm wrong. I have an Acer aspire E15 and an acer aspire 5 (5504) and the fan noise combined from those two laptops are less than 1/8th the loudness of this new laptop. IT IS TERRIBLE. Think you can live with that? There's more: If you're a long time user of acer products you've become used to the 2nd function keys being assigned between the F3 to F9 keys and in blue. Thats GONE with this laptop. Here's the new configuration. F1 (previously f4) is the sleep function key, F2 (previously unassigned) is now airplane mode/wifi disable key, F3 and F4 (previously wifi and sleep respectively) are to adjust screen brightness, F8 (previously mute function key) has switched places with F9 now serving the keyboard backlight on/off function, F9 (previously keyboard backlighting function) is actually the mute function key. F10 and F11 (previously unassigned) are now the volume down and up function keys respectively. Just to add some additional frustration to the mix none of these keys are the second function anymore. So if you're used to hitting F5 to refresh browser windows or F3 to search now you'll need to hit the Fn Key first as the media functions take precedence in this new keyboard layout. This can actually be changed by rebooting and pressing F2 to enter the bios settings before windows loads. Even if you change the F1 - F12 keys back to their original hierarchic order the arrow keys are no longer the keys to access brightness or volume control but instead are music media keys. Good luck with that confusion. This new laptop basically is an all out attack on keyboard shortcut users even the Home key is now a point of frustration since they removed the dedicated home key and you're only left with the numlock access only home key that shares functionality with the number 7 key on the keypad. I also had to finish install necessary driver level software like the \"acer quick access application\" because as this was not installed there was no way to know if num lock or capslock was engaged as there is no LED indicating the status of these keys. Even if you Update the bios to the latest firmware version like I did it still won't solve the problem of the USB 3.0 ports having slower read/write speeds than a typical USB 2.0 port. Anyway At least THANK GOD on the plus side as a result of all that fan noise you do get ample cooling so the laptop does stay nice and cool..... HAHAHHAHAHAHAH PSYCH NOOOOOOOOOOOO no such luck my friend this laptop gets VERYYYYYY HOTTTTT in your lap and it is just pathetic that for all the fan noise you have to deal with it can't even keep the laptop at a comfortable temp while sitting there idle without a single thing going on. The charger is also not the regular acer charger so if you have other acer laptops that can share chargers interchangeably this one will not work with them.  BTW this is all within the first half hr of use. Imagine what I'll discover by this time tomorrow. Seriously guys and gals if you're a long time acer product user and you've become accustomed to any level of consistency across their products just forget it with this laptop. I currently use the A515-51G-5504 aspire 5 for productivity and while you may think that the only difference between the two is that one has a dedicated graphics card and the other does not TRUST ME those two laptops are like NIGHT AND DAY different when it comes to speed, noise levels, and general build quality.

Super fast", "review_text": "I bough this Acer a few days ago to replace a Toshiba Satellite C55-C5241 that suddenly died (monitor stopped working) 3 short years after buying it. I was originally reluctant to buy an Acer as I was not very sure about the quality, was concerned about another review that mentioned the fan was very loud, and was not sure I could live with a SSD of 256 only. Here are my initial impressions: 1 Speed. It is a JOY to power up this computer. In fact, I shut it down and then back up just to enjoy how fast it is to power up. I was always amazed by how the Chromebook my son gets from his middle school was so much faster than my Satellite (or even the HP I have at work) was to power up. I guess it all pretty much boiled down to the SSD vs. the HDD hard drive. If you are debating whether it makes a difference, I can grantee you it makes a world of difference. This computer is up and running in seconds. I used to DREAD doing anything in my 3 year old Satellite. No more. It is also very fast to write to the SSD if you are downloading large files. Fast fast fast. 2 Storage. I have a ton of pictures and videos and they won't all fit in this 256GB SSD, but is it VERY easy to solve that. This computer comes with an HDD harness and cable to add an internal HDD (max width is 7mm) and there are Acer videos on  how to do it. I almost did it in about 15 minutes, but was unsuccessful only because I tried to use the 1TB HDD from my Satellite not realizing the width was 9.5mm until I tried to close the case back up. You can buy a compatible 1TB HDD for about $50. You can also add an external HDD of 2TB in capacity for about $60. With either of these solutions you get a really fast computer with enough storage. 3 Current Generation Processor (Intel Core 5 8th generation). You can check the benchmarks on how fast it is. For my General Family Laptop purposes it fits the bill just fine. 4 Build quality. This laptop feels very sold and I love the lighten keys that the Satellite did not have. 5 Really good overall value. I paid about $500 for this laptop, and if you factor an extra $50 to $60 for extra storage you are at a sub $600 setup with newest (as of July 2019) Intel Core 5, 256GB SSD, great build quality, good monitor, etc. I think it is a great deal. I have not tested this for video games or anything like that but for an overall home laptop it is great."}, {"name": "Robert D.

Setup is very simple, even with the minimal amount of manuals and documentation you find in the box. It's very literally a plug and play experience. Specs: 256GB SSD (excellent) 3.9Ghz i5 (you can do better, but might have to go up in price range) 8GB DDR4 RAM (not bad, you can do better) Windows 10 (excellent, albeit with ads) 4 total USB Ports (Excellent) The computer is fast on startup, no doubt because of the SSD and the good i5 chipset that comes with this model.  When multiple apps are running, it can experience slowdown, but typically this has only happened with me while I'm running very intense programs - playing or converting media while surfing the web and typing something.  Again, this is something that I doubt most users of the device will notice, but if you are a power user, it makes sense to upgrade from this model. The other thing to call out is the speakers - they are outstanding.  Loud, clear sound, and easy controls make this a standout feature that most laptops don't have. The only major downside for me is that there is only the 256GB SSD, without any traditional hard drive for data storage.  It's not that there are not options, from cloud storage to removable drives, but it is kind of an inconvenience for those who have large data libraries they'd like to access on the go.  The device does come with a kit to upgrade the drive kit, but few users, myself included, will likely crack this open and give it a go. Overall, this is a classy piece of equipment that belies it's low price, and that makes it a great buy in my opinion.  You wouldn't think from taking a look at the construction or the general performance that this is a budget priced laptop.  It won't be for PC gamers, although a few older games will run fine on the device, and power users will notice occasional slowdowns, but you'd likely know that as soon as you see that this model is on the low end of the ACER spectrum.

Runs very quickly with the latest i5 processor, and the SSD means boot up takes seconds. The 8GB RAM should be great for most people unless you typically run tons of programs at once. Fingerprint sensor works every time, and the backlit keyboard is a nice touch. Love the aluminum shell and the lighter than average feel. The fan does pop on randomly sometimes and can be a touch on the loud side, but usually pops right back off unless you're doing something very intensive. Seriously, no real complaints at all.

Initial set up was simple (though, because it is Windows 10, I am reminded why I HATE CORTANA!!!!) And everything is plug-n-play. Connect speakers, headphones, a mouse, or whatever sort of peripheral you need with no real problems.  As far as out-of-the-box ease and reliability, it is perfectly fine. People want laptops for three functions: work software, watching media, or gaming. Most laptops are built to do one of these functions well, at the expense of the other functions. It you are looking for a solid, reliable work laptop to handle documents, spreadsheets, and most business related software, this will work effectively. Unfortunately, there are plenty of lower priced laptops that will work just as effectively. In fact, if you are looking for a productivity laptop, you are probably looking for something with a touchscreen, which this unit does not have. This laptop can handle multiple spreadsheets open simultaneously while surfing the internet and handling email and messaging. But pretty much any decent laptop can do that these days for half what this one costs. If you are looking for something to watch videos and other media, the HD display is truly gorgeous. It really does have exceptional crispness. But then you need to ask yourself if watching those cat videos on Youtube or the latest Netflix series is actually worth over $800 to you, or will you get comparable results with a notebook or less expensive laptop. I personally am not the type of person who thinks spending that kind of money just to watch media on a laptop is a worthwhile investment. But if that is your thing, then this might be what you want. Lastly, gaming. This laptop is pretty useless for most modern gaming. It can run low-power games like Minecraft and older titles like Fallout 3 (note: Fallout 3 does not organically run on Windows 10. So there are a lot of workarounds and hacks you will need to do to get the game to work. But it can be done. It will run the MMO Neverwinter and looks good. It can run Star Wars the Old Republic on low settings. But it doesn't run much else. Forget running MMOs like Elder Scrolls Online or even games that are only a couple years old (Witcher 3 or Fall Out 4 simply won't run at all even on the lowest settings. The laptop doesn't meet the minimum requirements). I'm giving the laptop 4 stars because it has a great display and solid functionality. But that is based purely on the mechanics of the unit, not the usability of it. The problem is, for a gaming laptop, it is poor. And for a work or media laptop, there are comparable laptops that are just as good and almost half the price. Nothing about this laptop justifies the current price tag of over $800.

Got the Laptop swiftly like Amazon knows to deliver and opened up the box. So here are my impressions after 3 days of use (I will update my review after several weeks): Build quality&design: Acer design is pleasant, Business oriented but somewhat dull. The build seems ok, sturdy enough for general use but I would be careful not to drop the thing. the size is significantly bigger then my 14inch dell, so consider buying a protection sleeve for it, But for a 15.6inch laptop it's pretty light, so good for travel. Screen: The IPS screens delivers nice display, nice colors and sharpness. the brightness is more then enough for using during daytime, but not in direct sunlight or very sun lit rooms. The bezels are thin, but the screen is warping if you move it with your hands. All in all a nice HD display, nothing fancy. Touch&keyboard The touch pad is in a good size, ok accuracy but not needle precision. The multi fingers gestures works great. The keyboard is Chiclets style, has nice feedback and feel. But... NO indicator for CapsLock NO indicator for NumLock NO indicator for touchpad lock And the Home, End, PG Up, PG Down are on the NumPad so If you use them, it will be annoying to turn the NumLock off every time. The Backlight keyboard is great, But... It turns off automatically after 8 seconds and you can't change this setting. Why? only Acer knows the answer for that. Also, when you plugin the Laptop to the electric cable, the Small and almost invisible little blue led charging light indicator is located on the right side (the opposite side from the plug hole) and there is NO on screen indicator for it. What?! this is plain stupid. The wrist space on the keyboard is very convenient. Performance: Well, in this area no complaints so far. I5 8th gen is speedy and responsive. the Nvme drive is great and the 8G ram is enough for general use. All in All I gave it 4 stars, because for 500$ or so, it's pretty good deal, but the small and annoying things made it go down in rating.

It's quite fast and responds well enough, though I don't think I'm going to try any heavy AAA gaming on the MX250. Only cons are that I'm not a big fan of 4GB of the ram being soldered in permanently (though being a slim model I get get why,) and I don't think Acer enabled Adaptix power management on this so you're stuck at 15w for the CPU.

Some very high end, some low end. I'm currently moving and needed a laptop for motels/hotels that could allow me to work easily but not spend a lot for something I'll likely wind up giving to my kids after I'm done. This laptop's i5 processor is zippy compared to other i5s I've had. Having SSD out of the box combined with that makes a lot almost instant. I'm used to coding on linux without the overhead of Windows based IDEs but even Microsoft Visual Studio on here is decently fast. Some people have complained about the backlight on the keyboard going out after 30 seconds or whatever (I haven't timed it.) Do you want your battery dying fast? I don't. Really it's as simple as pressing any button for it to turn back on. In the very bottom-left is the control (ctrl) key which I just tap first so I'm not accidentally entering a wrong letter or such and boom the backlight is back on and stays on as you type. Another reviewer said it's not suitable for the dark but fact is that if their backlight was staying off they couldn't be typing much. On the note of the keyboard, it's really nice having a separate number pad on the laptop. A lot are missing this nowadays. Another reviewer complained about the F1-F12 keys defaulting to their functions instead of F buttons and having to use the Fn key. Well, just keep tapping F2 RIGHT after you hit the power button and before Windows loads to enter the BIOS settings. You can switch it to default to F1-F12 and hold the Fn key for the functions instead. Memory is 8GB upgradable to 20GB. I haven't bothered yet. I powerhouse on my desktops but haven't needed more on here yet. Even while running visual studio and installing multiple programs while using chrome and firefox I barely surpassed 4GB. Truth is I've never needed more than 8GB unless I was gaming even though the other computers have a minimum of 16. People are nitpicking at this laptop. It's a 500 dollar laptop. If you need more power/etc for your money, buy a desktop but then you also have to pay for a monitor or get a computer with a monitor in exchange for lower specs. I've been building computers and programming for 20 years now as well as gaming. I give this a thumbs up. Just don't expect to play any fancy games on it but truth is even the intel graphics has 4GB of GPU memory which is plenty for a lot of games combined with it's speed unless for some reason you need super high def graphics. Someone else mentioned RS3 on here. I've played it on lower computers. It's one of the benchmarks I use. I only play it with my wife for something to do together so haven't tested it on here as of now but it should definitely run without an issue. Also the WIFI chip/card (haven't looked) gets faster speeds than my tablet or phone. I'm using a mobile hotspot which is speed limited and get at least 4mbps on it which about maxes it. I'd safely assume normal WIFI would be much faster. I haven't heard the fan once even compiling a lot of code but I keep it on flat and hard surfaces. This is another complaint people have brought up... Know what you're buying when you buy. The vent is on the bottom as with other laptops I've purchased. Just don't block it and you won't have a problem. It's a fairly big vent area compared to having one on the side which actually is beneficial to cooling if you don't block it."}, {"name": "Mark R.

Decent size SSD (easily upgradeable to 1TB if you want/need), and comes with an extra SSD caddy, connector and spare screws to add a second storage drive.  High speed CPU/SSD/motherboard bus/interface (PCIe/NVMe).  Biometric security/ID options.  Nicely backlit keypad.  Decent number of input options.  The build is a little on the flimsy/plasticky side (only the top shell is aluminum, which is exactly where you want it BTW \u2026 to protect the most costly single part in the whole appliance:  the screen), but heck, that's \"entry level\" ... my laptop is at my workstation/desk most of the time, so that's no problem for me.  All my prior, trusty Toshiba Satellites had no aluminum on the outer case at all. This thing is sleek, lightweight, fast and very easy to set up/use.  Acer has taken all the most attractive advances in laptop tech from the past 5-10 years and figured out a way to streamline and squeeze them into a really nice entry level machine at a VERY competitive price.  The only thing I might grouse about on this laptop is the bare minimum 8GB RAM they put in it (the removable/replaceable part is only 4GB), but that can be upgraded to 20GB for around $60 if you need it. I've been using laptops as my primary work station for more than 20 years now, and every time I replace one, I marvel at how far they've come by the time I upgrade.  No exception to that rule here ... couldn't be happier with what I got for the buck in this one.  Only time will tell how it holds up.  Thanks Acer ... nice work, and thanks to Amazon and \"Prime Day\" for making my choice/purchase even easier. [P.S. to original review:  I had an unused spare HDD that I bought for my previous laptop a long time ago before converting it to SSD, and thought I might as well use it for extra storage space in this laptop.  It installed/worked fine with the caddy, connector and screws supplied by Acer, but I found that once I'd put the HDD in, the bottom cover was noticeably bulged over the HDD, and the edge closest to it wouldn't fully seat/seal, in turn, making the rest points on the bottom uneven/wobbly.  In short, Acer's case design is a little too thin for proper fit of an HDD in the internal secondary drive bay.  I ended up getting a new 2.5\" SSD which fit just fine in the secondary bay, but I SHOULD also be able to put an HDD in there and can't, that is, if I don't want a bulge and uneven/wobbly rest points on the bottom of my new laptop.  But, since re-purposing of my old HDD was an afterthought with no bearing on my original purchase decision, and everyone knows that laptop HDDs are rapidly going the way of the dodo anyway, this issue falls into the category of, e.g., \"minor annoyance.\"]"}, {"name": "Andrew Harman", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2019", "title": "DO NOT BUY - Screen Died After 6 Weeks", "review_text": "DO NOT BUY Purchased product via Amazon 6 weeks ago and at first it worked fine.

The materials used feel robust, are nicely finished, and everything is well assembled.  Overall it feels like a quality laptop.  The 15\" screen keeps it from being truly small, but it's thin and light enough to travel easily.  It's thicker than my circa 2015 15\" MacBook Pro, but it's lighter.  Included with the Acer is a power cord that has a AC/DC converter brick attached.  The power cord requires a grounded outlet. The laptop's screen opens and closes smoothly, stays in position well, and is held closed magnetically.  The screen pivots a full 180 degrees.  The screen is bright, sharp, colorful, and has a wide viewing angle.  It performs well editing photos and watching videos.  It's bright enough to use in a sunlight room but direct sunlight washes out the screen.  It's not as bright or sharp as the MacBook Pro's screen, but it also costs a lot less. The speakers are placed on the bottom front edge of the laptop.  The placement helps them reflect sound when the laptop is placed on a hard surface, but placing it on a lap or bed muffles the sound.  The speakers have decent sound quality but don't get particularly loud. The keyboard is back-lit and has large and satisfying to use keys.  I appreciate the numeric keypad.  The track pad is generously sized and works well. The selection of ports is robust and includes 3 USB type A ports, 1 USB type C port, an Ethernet port, a headphone jack, and an HDMI port.  The only thing missing is an SD card slot. In use the Acer has robust performance.  It can more than handle word processing, spreadsheets, e-mail, and web surfing.  It's also more than capable of streaming HD videos and editing photos in Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop.  It's not as quick as my MacBook Pro in Lightroom but it's not far behind and is a satisfying experience.  At one point I had an HD video streaming, a web browser open, and Lightroom running in the background simultaneously and the Acer was able to keep up.  It powers on quickly and is ready to go in less than a minute. It stays pretty cool while using it but you should be careful to not completely block the large grille on the bottom.  Battery life is great.  For just surfing the web you can easily get 7-8 hours out of a charge.  Video streaming and photo editing will give you about 3-4.

Sadly I did not open the box for several weeks and now I am stuck with it.  Shame on me. The flaw in question may seem minor, but it becomes so aggravating that even the most mellow person would want to throw it out a window.  The flaw?  The trackpad. Because the trackpad is one complete unit without a defined left or right 'mouse button', a plethora of issues can occur.  MOST annoying is that the slightest touch will move the cursor to another part of a sentence being typed - and it happens frequently.  Quickly and correctly typing notes or documents is not an option because of this.  Further, without a defined button for left and right, you can only be certain you are hitting the right key by going to the furthest left or right corner of the keypad.  It's hard to be efficient when you have to do this. It may not sound like much, but when your work includes lots of typing and use of the left and right mouse buttons, it can be infuriating. Edit 05/22 - Another problem - One I thought I would get used to, is the numeric keypad - the bottom row has the zero to the left, decimal button in the center, and enter button to the right.  This is not standard and it causes many errors. The computer itself is otherwise amazing - so I cannot fathom why they would include such a frustrating component to ruin the whole experience.

It's lightweight, but still has a graphics card that can handle some casual games. I can run Rocket League at high quality with all the effects at 60fps. Google NVIDIA MX250 and you can find a list of playable games. The most important reason I chose this laptop is that it's lightweight and yet there is a passable graphics card. I'm not a heavy gamer (or a gamer at all in that regard) so this laptop fits my needs perfectly. I do think that if you have high demands for gaming, you should probably invest in some other model. But then again, gaming laptops are often heavy, so this one is a nice middle ground for me."}, {"name": "mikestaff", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2019", "title": "Total Acer/Amazon Failure", "review_text": "Bought this laptop, but could not connect to internet to wi-fi network.

Using VLC it can play three HD videos at once with no issues, only using about 1/2 the CPU power. Exporting edited videos with VideoPad (the free editor) takes about as long as my 5th gen i7 system did - I was hoping for faster, but it's not bad. Software development is great. It has a nice display -  I can get a lot of code on the display with the small text getting fuzzy. I added a 16GB memory card for a total of 20 GB - with this I can run multiple memory hogging IDE tools and never get close to the memory limits. The upgrade was easy to perform. The SSD lets my compiles scream along as fast as any machine I've ever used (disk IO is usually the bottleneck for code development, the SSD fixes this if I keep my code on the C: drive.) . The SSD  waaaaay too small to use this as a media machine is you don't add more space. Fortunately ACER provides  a  7mm high slot for an additional disk, including the mounting bracket, cable and screws. This was a really nice touch for us techies! I installed a 1TB hard disk for about $40, ( which shows up as a \"D\" drive) and keep all my videos out there. The small \"C:\" SSD is only about have full, even after loading all my favorite development software out there. I was going to upgrade it to a 1TB SSD, but I may just not bother - the second drive takes the space pressure off. My first unit arrived with battery issues, but they sent me a replacement without even waiting for me to return the defective one, so I'll not take off any stars for that.  I might have also taken off a star for the small SSD, but their considerate provision for adding the second drive, especially including the cables and bracket, earns them back the star. Some other notes: - I really love the backlit keyboard. I'm spoiled, and never going to a plain one again :-)  - Battery life is great (4-5 hours), even with my screen turned up very bright, hard CPU use, and the extra drive. - I hate windows 10 for many reasons, but following online advice I've been able to beat it into submission. - The included Norton AV software is obnoxious, but can be easily uninstalled (which I did). AVG isn't much better, but at least its free. - It's is indeed light and thin, and small for a 15.6\" screen due to the narrow bezel. Very nice form factor! - I runs cool.

There is no option to make it stay on.  This laptop is not suitable for anyone who needs to use it in a dark environment. Performance - other than the annoying design decision above, this is a great laptop for its price.  Windows 10 boots in seconds and overall the laptop feels snappy. 1920x1080 Full HD IPS display - the screen has very minimal IPS light bleed so black level is actually quite decent.  But the sRGB coverage is only at 58% (per DisplayCAL calibration) so don't expect pictures to look terrific.  Again think about the price of this laptop and the screen is OK.  If you need a screen with full sRGB (or wide color gamut P3 like newer Macbooks) coverage, you will have to pay much more. Wifi speed is a bit disappointing.  My Mid 2015 Macbook Pro has about twice the download/upload speed.  This is based on the 5GHz band and the AP is an Apple Airport Extreme, so could this be a compatibility issue?  I have Verizon FiOS 1Gbs Internet connectivity. Connectivity - great onboard connectivity options with 2 x USB 3.1, 1 x USB-C, 1 x USB 2.0, 1 x HDMI, 1 x Ethernet.  I can only get the onboard HDMI 2.0 port to reach 4K@30Hz not 60Hz.  This is tested with an LG 55\" E7 OLED and a 49SM8600PUA Nano 8 Series 49\" TV.  Enabling/Disabling HDMI Deep Color option on the TV makes no difference.  Changing HDMI input to PC mode on the TVs also makes no difference. Battery Life - I can't comment on the battery life as I tend to plug in the AC adaptor.  I would leave the battery at 80% or lower if I know I won't need to use the laptop for a while. Overall a very solid laptop for its price.  I just wish ACER could change the backlit design to allow it to stay on.

However, I will warn you that this laptop comes with bloatware. In that case, you can use Windows built-in start from fresh tool in Windows Defender to get rid of that. Overall, this laptop should be decent enough for apps, editing videos, etc. Just beware the battery life. Also, you may want to update the BIOS. You can do that on Acer's support page where you can find the drivers and BIOS to update. This may solve some fan issues. Also, for Linux users, Ubuntu 19.04 is the distribution that seems to work with this laptop. You'll have to switch off secure boot and turn on ACHI. Beware: If you do this, Windows will be wiped and you'll have to install it again. If you try to use Manjaro or any Ubuntu distro before 19.04, you will either get no WiFi or a touchpad that does not work.

I think it is a great product for its price, that offers a discrete GPU that will outperform any Intel iGPU on the market, and it does so in a reasonable chassis. Unfortunately to offer such a low price for this laptop their support is pretty lackluster, and the quality control is not very good.  My laptop came with a defective memory unit, the memory that is soldered onto the motherboard to be specific. It took me a while to notice (too long to return) because the user-replaceable memory stick was swapped out for an 8gb one.  The laptop has 2 memory DIMM slots, both should be 4gb giving you a total of 8gb.  This is why the maximum amount of ram that you can upgrade in this is 20gb (16gb come from the stick you can change, the other 4gb is the nonreplaceable memory soldered onto the motherboard).  Unfortunately, the only way to fix this is to replace the entire motherboard. None of the customer support knew what I was talking about when I would explain that the memory soldered to the motherboard is defective.  They would just ask, \"Did it come with 8gb, does it turn on, etc\u201d This means that my computer doesn't have dual-channel memory, which hurts processor performance and memory performance.  It also means that I will always have 4gb less ram than what I should have.  If I install a 16gb stick I should have 20gb of total memory, but I will only have 16gb.  At one point I was even told that some models come with extra memory soldered to the motherboard and some models don't, which is just not true.  All these laptops (A515-54G-5928) have 4gb soldered onto the motherboard and Acer has publicly said so,  \"There is one slot that supports up to 16GB for max total of 20GB memory.\" Eventually, I was able to send my laptop in for repair.  I typed out a letter detailing the problem and how I know that the memory on the motherboard is defective, just in case there was a miscommunication somewhere.  I also sent the laptop in with the 8gb stick that was incorrectly supplied with the laptop. (it should be 4gb so that total memory is 8gb.  An 8gb stick should give a total of 12gb of memory) The tech that 'repaired' my laptop turned it on, saw that there was 8gb of total ram, and sent it back to me saying there were no issues found. Now I have another repair case to send the laptop in, postage is covered this time but only by FedEx.  I live in a small city, attending university, and have no car.  The nearest FedEx location is literally in another state.  So every time I ship this laptop back to them it will cost me about $30.  This means I am already down about $60 for a repair covered under warranty if I ship this back again.  They have already shown that they are not thorough with the repair, and I do not know how many more times it is going to take for them to finally replace the motherboard.  Every time they do not repair the laptop I will lose money, 30,60,90,120 etc.  I wonder how much it will cost to fix this. The entire time this is going on, I am in the middle of my engineering degree and I need a laptop for school.  Acer has put me into a very difficult situation, and I will no longer be recommending them.

Here is what you need to know. Slim and light build: People are here complaining about the plastic chassis and aluminum screen cover without realizing that this form factor is what keeps the laptop at under 2kg (under 4lbs). Cheapest laptop with an IPS display = Full 180 degree viewing angle with zero color shifting. Cheapest portable GPU = can play low requirement games like League of Legends at 1080p 60FPS easily and can play most modern games if downscaled to 720p Long lasting battery life = 8-10h battery life with light internet browsing. 6-7 hours of video playback. 4-5 hours of intensive gaming. Thermal efficiency = The laptop runs cool when the GPU not engaged.  When GPU and CPU are running at max, the fan is a little loud and the fan exhaust will heat up but it is unnoticeable on the keyboard. The downsides: The thin form factor combined with a long lasting battery and thermal efficiency comes at a cost.  While fine in dark environments, the screen is not as bright in direct sunlight (low wattage).  The CPU turbo-boosts to 3.4ghz for 10 seconds, and will then downclock to maintain temp and battery life.  The CPU may downclock even more when the GPU is engaged for long periods of time, again to maintain temperature and battery life. What this means is that the i5 version is more cost efficient than the i7 version as this laptop will almost never fully utilize it's CPU when running on max loads.  In short bursts, the difference between i5 and i7 is not noticeable.  The i7 version will only benefit those who are using high intensity loads in short bursts, like photo editing software like Photoshop, rendering programs like AutoCad, or statistical engines like SAS.

The screen resolution is crisp and amazing quality when playing 4k videos on YouTube or just general browsing on the internet. The speakers are located at the bottom of the laptop towards the front so a pretty weird place making the speaker quality not so great. I didn't get this laptop for audio so it's not an issue for me, but probably a good idea to hook up external speakers up for this laptop if you want better audio quality. There is a backlit keyboard that does stay on only for 30 seconds and then will turn off if you are not using the keyboard, BUT they came out with a Bios update within the last month or so where you can change that setting in the Bios menu to have the backlit keyboard on all the time. A quick search online for that will lead you to an article from Acer giving step by step instructions on how to do that. Several people talked about a fan noise issue. 99% of the time I don't hear the fan at all and 99% of the time it's dead quiet. Only when I updated the laptop (drivers, software, etc) did I hear a fan noise or when rendering a video through Premiere Pro. When I am browsing the internet watching YouTube or checking social media, I do not hear the fan. This is also a good reminder to immediately update all the drivers when you first get the laptop as well going into Settings, Update and Security and install settings there as several drivers had to be updated and several items were updated in the Update and Security section. Another issue I saw were people saying the couldn't connect to their wifi or the laptop kept disconnecting from the wifi. So far I had no issue with that and could have been an issue with their modem/router. It is indeed tricky to open the laptop if you close it, but not a deal breaker for me and shouldn't be for anyone. Since this laptop came with a SSD, I can turn the laptop on, log in and be at the home screen in 10 seconds flat which is amazing if you need to quickly jump on the computer. Adobe products (Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere Pro) also open up really fast and had no issue editing and rendering 4k video along with 1080p video in Premiere Pro. This laptop will be replacing a Lenovo laptop that I bought in 2014 where it is an i7, has 8gb ram and a 2gb NVIDIA graphics card. So far, this Acer laptop has blown the Lenovo laptop away in regards to speed, screen resolution (both being Full HD screens) and being able to quickly render 1080p and 4k video along with having no issues watching 4k videos on YouTube.

The (not so) bad: - When setting the PC up for the first time be prepared to plug in a LAN cable for internet connectivity to upgrade the WIFI driver (the wifi could not initiate out of the box - possibly an initial windows update, no solid evidence but it worked fine for about 20 minutes, then required a reboot following initial setup and general Win10 rumblings, then could not find the access point or maintain connectivity every once in a while when it did find one. - Has 4GB of DDR4 RAM permanently soldered to the mainboard and a 4GB SODIM installed so the upgrade option is to add an 8GB stick for 12 GB total or a 16GB for 20 total (the option I went with) - Number Pad is a bit on the lean side. - It comes shipped with the F-Keys set to control features rather than standard F1-F12 functionality. This is easily changed in the Bios and will never trouble you again - just weird that it comes out bucking standard protocol. Otherwise, haven't had too much opportunity to use it (purchased for the wife - the proof will be how often she curses :)) - Will update as usage data becomes available. Update 1 (03.27.20) No complaints so far. Still running well and speedy. I upgraded the memory to 20gb and added the old ssd drive to it.

After two and a half weeks, these are my thoughts: Speed: The primary reason I wanted to update my laptop from a nearly 6-yr old HP Pavilion was to get better speed. This laptop delivers the goods. With an 8th generation i5-8265u, 8GB of RAM (expandable to 20GB max), and a 256GB PCIe-NVMe SSD, it is only the Intel UHD 620 graphics that holds it back. From completely off (not sleeping), to booted and signed in, with a functional desktop, ready to respond, takes 12 seconds. The SSD gets most of the credit, though the fingerprint reader speeds sign in significantly (it doesn't work every time). Apps open quickly, and web pages load promptly. More importantly, it feels fast. On User Bench, it tests out as only a Surfboard as a gaming platform, and a Sailboat as a workstation (no big surprises based on the graphics and amount of RAM), but it is a Battlecruiser as a desktop. For everyday computing, this rig is a member of the Brute Squad. So, on speed, it earns a solid check mark. Screen: Excellent. It is bright, colors are nicely saturated, and, as expected these days, no dead pixels. At typical working distance, it is a retina screen, with not a pixel in sight. Thanks to the IPS technology, the wide viewing angle without the \u201cphotographic negative\u201d effect is a solid plus. How many nits, and what percent of the color gamut can it display? Don't know, don't care. It easily passes the \u201ceye test.\u201d So the screen warrants a solid check mark. Of note, this is NOT a touchscreen. Keyboard: The other reason I wanted to upgrade was to have a back-lit keyboard. It was a MUST-have, and I will not purchase another laptop, or any other keyboard that is not back-lit. Are you listening out there, all you laptop manufacturers? I like the size of, and the feel of the keys. It is a fairly quiet keyboard. The back light does turn off after 30 seconds of no input, in order to conserve battery. Some have criticized this feature. If you continue input, it does not turn off. If it turns off, it comes back on by depressing any key. And the back light is not just around the edges of each key, but each character is is illuminated as well, so you can really see what you are doing. The only negative is that the Home, End, PgUp, and PgDn keys share double duty with 4 keys of the numeric keypad, and you have to turn NumLock on and off to use them. Also, the NumLock and the hated CapsLock key do not have indicator lights to tell you if the are on or off. Both of these are significant, though not fatal flaws, in my opinion. So on the keyboard - check. WiFi: It works. No fuss, no muss. Connects easily, and it is fast. On Speedtest by Ookla, it produces a download speed of 207mbps, and an upload speed of 116mbps, over a background of a nominal internet connection speed of 300mbps. Of course, your results will vary. WiFi \u2013 check. Form Factor: This is a 15.6\u201d screen, and it weighs ~4lbs. It is comfortable to use. The track pad is fairly large, and works well, though I have yet to learn all the gestures that are available. I like it. Fan Noise: This has been an issue of criticism in some reviews of Aspire 5's. I would disagree. Most of the time, fan noise is minimal or absent. Occasionally, if the CPU is pushed harder, fan noise does become audible. However, it tends to be short-lived, e.g., <30 seconds. So I don't regard it as much of an issue. Battery Life: I mostly use my laptop plugged in, so battery life is not a major issue for me. However, the estimate of 5hrs of battery life on average seems reasonable, based on some experience on battery power. The claim of 9.5 hrs maximum seems a bit of a stretch, but not necessarily impossible if you maximize power saving. Adding a 2nd SSD: With only 256GB on the SSD, a 2nd hard drive of some sort seems mandatory. These days, given the prices of SSD's, there is little excuse for installing a traditional HDD. I added a 1TB Crucial SSD, at a very reasonable price, and the upgrade was relatively easy (the hardest part was prying the back off after removing the 11 screws), aided by a very helpful Acer YouTube video that walks you through the process. Also, the laptop comes with the needed bracket, cable and connector, and all the screws to add the SSD. So, adding the 2nd SSD, which was a MUST-have, was painless. Good one, Acer! In Sum: For <$500 (at the Black Friday prices for the laptop and SSD), I have an awesome laptop, built for general everyday computing tasks. In my book, this is an outstanding value. 5-month update: After 5 months with this laptop, I have only come to appreciate it even more. It remains very fast, everything works, the screen and the keyboard are great (excepting the few keyboard omissions noted above), battery life is more than acceptable. Best laptop I have ever owned, by a lot!

I had to get a replacement as I received a similar model but not the one i ordered (A515-54G-73WC). I could see how most people wouldn't think twice about this but its important to check. The box i got had the correct model number but the laptop did not. That being said, this laptop didn't end up working out for me. I am definitely a power user, and the specs of this laptop are great. I upgraded it with a 16gb module maxing it out at 20GB and I replaced the M.2 SSD that came with it, with a 1TB 970 Pro. I didn't have any issues with the specs or performance. It was fantastic at this price point. I did have issues though with the overall quality of the device as well as what I believe were BIOS issues with using a different hard drive than what came with it. I couldn't get the laptop to properly go into standby or hibernation mode without some combination of BSOD or being told the hard drive couldn't be found etc. This wasn't going to work for me as i needed to use the fast 970 PRO. Maybe Acer will update the BIOS and that will help in the future. This may not be an issue for you, especially if you don't re-image the laptop or put in a different hard drive. I did happen to time battery life. Using the high performance profile doing lots of various tasks, basically everything a power user would do minus playing games, it lasted 3 hours and 10 minutes until i got the 15% warning. At this point it said it had 19m remaining. Do keep in mind this was a brand new battery so this should improve. I also noticed that it seemed to run the fans pretty loud.. especially when i first got it. It seemed to die down after having it for a week, but it still seemed to be louder than what i would expect. Pros: Inexpensive Awesome specs for the price Easy to open the case to replace the memory module or hard drive. I actually kind of liked the color, but some would say it doesn't have the \"premium\" look Cons: Possible BIOS issue with using different hard drives. Included SSD is a slow SSD (some may not even notice this) Plastic body Body sometimes would \"creek\" when it flexed (it was minor.. but an artifact of the plastic build) I only had one for a bit over a week with my normal usage, and it already started to \"wear\" in the palm area below the keyboard. Body seemed to pick up oils easily. Just needs more cleaning. The lid needs a bit more of a touch to open as it doesn't have a notch like some laptops do. I found it had a small \"ridge\" that would usually work to get it to open, but it wasn't as easy as it could have been. In order to trigger the power button to turn off or hibernate, you have to hold it for 3ish seconds. The back lit keyboard wouldn't turn on when swiping the touchpad, only when pressing a key. I know I had a lot of negatives here and the laptop didn't end up working for me.. but I feel like it has its place. If your looking for a budget laptop with excellent specs, but can deal with some of the nuances of a less expensive build then this is for you. You wont find something similar and aesthetically pleasing without spending at least $3-400 more.

They propose it is to  \"Enhance the users experience\" but in reality they are at best a nuisance and some are malicious usage trackers.. In the past these were relatively easy for technically literate users to eliminate. Now they have become much more sophisticated and devious and it took me about 5-6 hours to \"disinfect\" this ACER 5 slim machine. I use my laptop for serious work and cannot have tracking software of any kind so I am very careful what I load on my machines. I do not use Facebook, Twitter, Skype or even the Google search engine because of their  \"behind-the-screens\" mischief. SO I thought I have every thing cleared off except the pre-installed Firefox browser (my browser of choice). I was setting this machine up for my wife and upon boot-up the desktop and functionality has to \"look\" just like the old machine else she is not \"happy\" with the change. Even to the point of having the exactly same Firefox tabs open in the new machine as was open in the old machine. So after everything was prepared and all the other software installed I moved her old Firefox \"profile\" to the new machine and turned it over to her. After about 5-10 minutes Firefox locked up and would not exit. Even \"task manager\" could not clear the fault. I was able to force a \"restart\" but then Firefox would not load at all. At this point I have about 20 hours of time in this project. If I was doing this for a customer that would be about $1000 dollars for a $500 dollar computer. In the end and MANY hours of work later, after doing aWindows restore to the initial state of the machine and removing all the \"crapware\" again I used control panel to uninstall Firefox and deleted all its related folders including those in the hidden c:/user/username/%APPDATA% and c:/user/Public/downloads folder (delete everything there). I then downloaded Firefox from their website and set everything up again. So far all looks good but she uses Facebook so her footprints are being collected. I never use her computer for my work so that's OK. In the near future I will need a new machine and am not looking forward to having to set it up. Next time I will buy a Microsoft Surface Tablet I hear they have very little useless software preinstalled. This is not just an ACER problem HP is probably the worst. It seems everyone is trying to copy the Facebook model to collect as much user data as they can as there is a HUGE market for this data, The problem is once they have it it is lucrative for \"hackers\" to harvest it and they sell for nefarious purposes.

Also, I am not a \"gamer\" per se, so I don't need the gaming stuff (fast processors, awesome graphics processing cards, whatever).

Even on 2G wi-fi, the speed never even hiccups. * The graphics are AMAZING and the screen size is awesome. Love the backlit keyboard, and the ability to use night settings to cut down on blue light emissions so I (might) go to sleep on time! * For the money, this is a great laptop for those who aren't \"serious gamers\" -- although I have used it for movies, TV shows, streaming live, etc. and it is phenomenal. I don't do any gaming that requires fast processing, so this doesn't matter to me at all. * Downloading movies, TV shows, large documents, bulky JPG files, everything has gone very quickly and smoothly. Even using my screenwriting software hasn't caused any problems at all, regardless of how much I do all at once (I multi-task a LOT). I currently have 17 tabs open on Google Chrome, Word, and my system is updating. No issues! * Works great with portable hard drives, wireless headphones, wired earbuds, phone integration (cell phone synced with laptop for messaging while working), and the power cord actually was identical to my previous Chromebook! * Lightweight, large screen, nice-sized keyboard (includes the numerical pad) and a lot of features I still haven't gotten to explore! CONS: * The battery dies rather quickly, when used for movie/TV show viewing (about 4 hours from full charge). When used for writing/editing and online work (only) it lasts closer to 7 hours. * Sometimes, the touchpad will just stop working, altogether. However, I use a wireless mouse so this doesn't bother me very much. If you use the touchpad exclusively, this will be a MAJOR issue. * If you are used to having big, fat hard drive space -- well, that's just silly (use the cloud, people!!) -- then you will not like the \"smaller\" amount of hard drive space on this laptop.

Is NOT Reliable (REVISED)", "review_text": "****ORIGINAL**** I love this computer.  I have purchased so many other computers that were no good and ended up giving them away.  This is the first Acer computer I have ever purchased and was impressed with the speed.  The boot-up time is like one second.  I wondered if I left it on overnight, but I didn't.  It's just fast on its own. Occasionally I had problems with the fingerprint reader being a little fussy and made me have to use the PIN until I figured out it works better if I don't swipe my finger and just tap from above.  Deleting and redoing it fixed the problem. I purchased this mainly because I wanted the fingerprint reader and hate passwords.  I am very security conscious, and all new computers should be required to have the fingerprint reader otherwise I won't buy them. Less hard drive space is no problem for me since I mostly use external drives and cloud storage.  I do not keep a lot of personal data on the 256GB SSD drive very long for security reasons.  I mostly use this computer for online, paying bills, and some graphics software.  Now I'm starting to use it more for other software because it is a fast computer even for an i5.  I'm looking to order another Acer and stop buying the brand I've been using for years.  Even after installing large graphics programs I still have about half the space left. I highly recommend this laptop if you want something fast.  I have been using an older version of a 3D program (Poser), and when I found out it was running a little too slow, I moved the content files from the hard drive to an external drive with my other extensive content.  Those files that are normally required to live on the hard drive work much better on an external drive with other content.  There was a major improvement with opening files and many of mine are several hundred GB's in size.  If this laptop can handle opening those files there may be some luck with graphic games.  I haven't tried that yet and probably won't since I don't know if it will work putting Steam games on an external drive and those files are large. This Acer laptop came with a bracket for having another drive installed, but I doubt I'll bother.  It said in instructions to have it done professionally.  My luck with professionals where I live hasn't been good so I'm satisfied just using external drives and whatever space is left on the SSD drive. REVISION: About a month after purchasing it, I had two Blue Screen errors the same day telling me I should reset it.  I thought it could be attributed to a bad Windows 10 driver.  It happened shortly after resetting it and I was connected via Ethernet so it was updating as it was reinstalling Windows 10.  I wasn't even sure if this Acer laptop had a recovery partition for restoring, and their idea of creating my own restore disc was pitiful like many others. For the second reset, I did it offline and it restored okay without adding Windows 10 junk along the way.  That was three days ago (1/13/2020), but it hasn't been acting right since then.  My backup software that used to work on this computer will no longer backup anything when it worked fine before.  When trying to backup after the two resets it completely wiped my external drive that I used for previous backups. The second victim was plugged into the second USB port which wiped that drive containing a large amount of data files that I normally use to update other drives.  Fortunately those drives were current since this Acer monster ruined this second drive.  After that I decided not to connect any more drives and just backup to my cloud accounts. I have found what seemed to be reliable in the beginning can no longer be trusted.  I'm planning to throw this unreliable data destroyer in the trash after I get a new one.  This was my first (and last) Acer and I was hoping it would be an improvement over two other brands that I found bad.  They don't make good laptops anymore. Here are a few flaws I found for this Acer.  This may not be typical for everybody or other models. 1. Their update software doesn't work.  Even after the one reset offline, the Acer Care Center software never found any updates.  I noticed this before prior to the two BSOD errors.  There are never any updates for anything.  This software must be connected to a server that no longer works.  One other thing, a reset does not install their Acer Care Center software.  You have to hunt for it, download and install it yourself.  Not what I consider user friendly.  Don't bother looking for it since it doesn't work anyway. 2. After the crashes, the fingerprint reader kept losing its settings and even after redoing the fingerprint set up it would never work.  I always had to use the PIN instead. 3. Also after the crashes, I had to keep re-setting up the log in.  I finally turned off all of the security because it was doing it on its own anyway. I will never buy another Acer.  And it started off just fine when I got it.  I no longer love it.  I hate it because it destroyed two external drives that worked just fine on other computers, and they weren't that old.  Prior to this paperweight, I had three other laptops that I got rid of only because they were slow.  They never devoured an external drive.  It helps to keep lots of external backups of the same information.  Not worth sending back.

I do appreciate Intel and Windows so must admit that I wouldn't have bought it if it didn't have an Intel processor and Windows 10; the graphics are also Intel. The Aspire 5 easily connects to wifi in any room of the house and on my back deck. I don't keep deep, dark secrets on my laptop so have never before password-protected one but, for those who want such protection, you can choose a PIN or fingerprint (and perhaps both).  I didn't find an option to skip this security feature so chose the fingerprint and have to admit that, if I wanted that protection, it is a fast and secure way of providing it.  My grown sons tried to \"break in\" just to see if they could and they could not so they're now teasing mom about what must lurk in her browser history.

The screen is very nice-I'm glad I decided to spend the extra money to get a laptop with full HD. For those wondering about the fan, it's not that loud. I noticed it at first but now I don't even hear it. Most of the time I have a fan on in my room and I cannot hear the laptop fan over that. I love the backlit keyboard too. Battery life is ok, but something has to give, right? Make sure you inspect it completely when it arrives. The first one I received was shipped with a dead pixel. I didn't have time to send it to Acer for repairs so I returned it to Amazon and ordered another one. Had no issues whatsoever with the return process. I called Acer and the technician said he never heard of a new device being shipped with a dead pixel. I wondered if mine had been used before, or maybe it was damaged in shipping. Anyways they sent me another one and it's been great so far."}, {"name": "P.

I use my laptop for several hours every day...Im a blogger and freelance writer so for what I need it is more than perfect.  1. This is NOT a touch screen - I don't personally care, since I don't need/want one. 2. The colors are crisp and bright with ample screen space. 3. Comes with 8GB of RAM, however 4GB is welded to the board so it can't be removed. I did purchase 16GB DDR4 SODIMM (Crucial) and replaced the 4GB with the 16 (I now have 20GB of RAM). This has provided me with ample speed for the tasks that I need to perform. It comes with Win10 Home and I think 258GB of SSD. Things I've seen in the reviews that others complain about: THE FAN - so after a week of what I consider med-heavy use, multiple tasks and functions  at once...I think I just heard the fan today. So..it's not LOUD like some reviewers have stated and it lasted for maybe 8 seconds or less. What I was doing when the fan came on..I was in a blanket working and the laptop was on my lap. I'm pretty sure it was cooling itself because I had it covered up. I'm back at my desk for almost 30mins and I've not heard it again.  The fan is not an issue at all. 4. People also complained about the key back lights not staying on a long time. Not sure what they are talking about..The back light stays on as long as you are typing. It will go off if you are NOT touching the keys. Perhaps they mean if you just want to turn them on and off, they only stay lit for a few seconds..but honestly, why would they need to be on if I'm not typing?? I'll list out some quirks that I've had to adjust to (they are not deal breakers or cons, just minor adjustments) Things I've had to get used to: 1. The number keypad - the 0 is off to the left and not in the center where the DEL/. key is. So I have to pay attention to entering numbers because I keep hitting the DEL key and not the 0. Just a weird placement thing I guess. 2. The key pad is off to the left a bit and not dead center so I tend to brush over it if I'm not using an actual mouse. 3. Opening the lid - so this is real thing that takes getting used to. there are little etchings on the corners to help you lift the lid but they are too flat to be useful. Thats more of a design flaw and not a deal breaker. you'll have to slide your finger tips in between the space on the top lid and bottom lid..after a few tries it becomes normal. 4. Taking off the back  panel to upgrade the memory was a pain to get off. you need something to shimy the back off..No way around it..I accidentally scratched the back of my device..it's minor. It's a one time activity so be careful. This device is sleek, thin, beautiful. I needed a new device and didn't want to spend 1000's of dollars. This was about 600 with everything and I'm so happy (so far) that I did. I'll update my post if something changes, but a week in..several posts later, I have no complaints.  A reviewer listed out the memory card to buy and I did just that and it was fine. I actually ordered my memory card the same time I ordered the device so I wouldn't have to wait another 2 days after receiving it.  I love it. You should definitely consider this purchase before dismissing."}, {"name": "B.

In response to a question about how much this computer's RAM can be upgraded to, Acer stated explicitly \"This model has two memory slots and is upgradeable to max of 32GB. The slots are not considered user accessible but if you feel comfortable removing the bottom case assembly and battery, more memory can be added.\" That is ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE. I've been in the back of my comp, and it is DEFINITELY only one slot available. So the max you're getting out of this model is 16 GB Ram. Infuriating though that be, I'll admit that even at that speed, this computer can handle most of your need. I run quite a bit of data analyses via R and SAS, and this can handle a reasonable load of code. If you're hoping to upgrade the NVMe M.2 SSD, it's worth noting that there's only one slot there as well, so be sure to grab an adapter for the cloning process before you switch out your cards.

This is my first Acer, and my first non box and mortar store laptop purchase. The screen is beautiful and the laptop is very light. I love that it has a number pad and the backlit keyboard. But that's it! My issues are that the sound & videos cards seem not to work correctly, and no amount of updating drivers has fixed it. With the volume all the way up, I can just barely hear it. This is only partly due to the poor placement of the speakers. Something is wrong with the volume. I\u2019m not a computer guru, but I shouldn\u2019t have to be. I\u2019ve checked Acer\u2019s website and Googled solutions in case it was a Windows issue. I\u2019ve gotten correct sound once or twice, but when the laptop is restarted, it reverts back to the settings it had before. I had to wear headphones in order to complete my video trainings for work. All the video programs run in double time speed. The program I used on my previous laptop to play videos won\u2019t play them on this lap top. I finally found a program that would work. My other  complaint is that this takes some special charging cable that is apparently different than every other Acer model made. My cable got damaged, and it took a wrong purchase from Amazon, and an hour on the phone with Acer customer service to figure out what cable was needed. I had to order it from Acer (and wait 10 days for shipping or pay exorbitant fees for overnight) with no way to charge my lap top I use for work. While there are some nice features, I wouldn\u2019t buy it again. Update April 2020. Removing 2 stars. Nothing but one problem after another. The touch pad crapped out for a while. Drivers constantly need installed again, but every time the computer is restarted, it reverts back to it's original settings which impact sound, video, and now touchpad.

CONS: Speaking of the screen, it's bright enough, but lacks a degree of color saturation. It's a small thing, but noticeable when watching an episode of \"Star Trek\" (1966), which used vivid colors. No fingerprint reader. that was a bit surprising. The sound is truly lacking. The speakers sound small and flat, and the volume isn't what I would like.

Pros- This thing starts up super fast, the finger print scanner is something I never thought I'd love as much as I do.  At school I type my password in 18, 657 times a day so one less step is wonderful.  The processor is fast, as fast as I need it to be anyway.

This machine is lightweight, the build is plastic but still seems sturdy, and it powers through me through lesson plans, Google Classroom, and my photography hobby.  Note I said hobby--a professional photographer may need more than this. It does come with a HDD upgrade kit.  So with a screwdriver and a YouTube video I think anyone can easily upgrade this. I have not upgraded it as I don't see the need.  Oh, and I was easily able to put Cortana to sleep. I do not want any listening devices in my home. Cons- There is no optical drive.  This was not an issue for me, but may be for someone else.  The speakers are so-so.  Not bad, but not good.  If you want to stream music, I suggest external speakers, but for Netflix binging it's fine.  This laptop will not meet the needs of a serious online gamer in memory, graphics, or processor speed.

This is my first laptop in over 10 years where I fear I'll have to start using a raised, laptop stand with auxiliary cooling fans. Is there a silver lining to this waste of money?

My last laptop was a HP and only lasted 18 months (motherboard), only leaving the living room a few times to print something in the bedroom. I had purchased an Acer for my daughter once and it lasted 5 years so bought this one. I've had this almost 5.5 months. I quickly figured out how to take all the fancy stuff off the touchpad, except for 2 finger scroll. I had to learn to deal with that. The problem with the touchpad is sometimes you have to right or left click way in the corner or it doesn't work. Now it's getting so I have to click two or three times before it works. It seems you have to strike it harder too. It doesn't matter which browser I use but it tends to freeze, for the weirdest reasons. Like scrolling, closing a tab, clicking a link, or closing a browser. If I ignore it for a few minutes it will work again. At least a couple times a month this laptop comes out of sleep with a blue screen stating an unexpected error occurred and it had to restart. I'm unable to read the whole thing as the screen doesn't stay up long enough but I did catch \"Unexpected Store Stop\" near the bottom of the screen. I seem to have the WiFi issue others have mentioned but not as bad. It happens every few days I think. It drops for a few minutes, comes back for a few, then drops again, over and over. I don't know how long it lasts as I give up and pull my Kindle out. The latest is the computer beeps, the screen dims, and the battery tries to start charging, even though it's plugged in. The pc figures this out, shows the battery is full, and the screen brightens again. I've tried manipulating the cord to see if there was a short or loose wire as this tends to happen when I move the Acer, even just a tiny bit. I've tried unplugging and letting the battery run down.  After it charges back up it still does it but the beeping seems to stop for a bit.  It now seems to have gotten to the point it just does it. Perhaps it's the vibration from typing?  I'm disabled and sit in my recliner with the laptop balanced on the arm of the chair or the arm and my knee. With all these problems I'm afraid I just can't recommend this computer.

I wanted a good PC. I didn't want the world's most powerful gaming rig, and I didn't want an overpriced snail PC. This computer is for my day to day gaming, and normal tasks, this PC is totally good. Totally normal. MOST importantly, it doesn't suck- And what more can you ask for when investing $850 on a computer you'll own for the next 4-8 years. extra detail, for those that need more convincing: My old laptop was 8 years old. It works great- and it's pretty fast for a 8 year old PC. The time had come to replace is with a new PC. My old PC got me through engineering school, and was pretty great (except its lack of dedicated graphics) My basic requirements were simple. 1) Must be equal or faster than my current PC 2) Must be able to play some of the games I missed out on over the last 8-years. 3) Battery life of greater that 5 hours. This ACER fulfills my totally modest and average requirements! that's why I give it 5 stars (The only drawback- The track-pad isn't amazing. For detailed maneuvering of the cursor; trying to move the mouse one or two pixels is possible, but much more frustrating that it should be.) This is fine for normal tasks, but frustrating for gaming. GET A MOUSE if you want to game) ---------------------------- So, stuff I've been doing since I've been using this PC for a few months: first thing I did was use the BIOS mode to change the F1-f12 keys to be function keys by default, and making pressing [fn]+f1 put the PC to sleep, change volume, brightens ect. rather than the secondary functions being on by default. (if you want to do this, look up how on google- it's pretty simple) I'm really glad that boot time is under 30 seconds. I don't hesitate turning the PC off, rather than leave it on for weeks as I did with my old PC. The charging chord is small. doesn't affect performance at all, but it is a tiny little wire. No optical drive (CD, DVD) so I will need to get a USB CD drive later. I play some pretty basic games, usually in the 10-5 year old window. Cities Skylines is currently my time waster. really no issues playing at all. Minecraft runs great. I've played some CS:CO. It does great for normal online matches (Make sure you get an external keyboard and mouse)."}, {"name": "Kate", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2020", "title": "I love my laptop for schoolwork, coding, and fun!", "review_text": "This laptop is a big bang for your buck situation.

The Touchpad is pretty annoying (I often click down and it registers as a right click), but for the most part it's manageable. I use a mouse mostly and I recommend you do too. Hands down my favorite feature is the Fingerprint Scanner: VERY fast and and accurate. I'm coming from a Macbook and this is a welcome transition that cost me 1/4 the price. Speaker quality is very good. If you're someone who wants better, you'll probably buy a bluetooth speaker anyway. The weight is fairly light given what it contains and I find it very portable. The build and material feel okay: not super cheap, but you definitely want to be careful with it (I abused my Macbook a bit because it was more resilient.) It's got all the important ports- Doesn't have a disk drive but you don't really need those anymore. It's very thin and fits great into my backpack (I HIGHLY recommend getting a protective case).

My first Acer product, and is now used mostly for email, internet and some light document producing.  8th Gen i5 processor is little improvement over my i5 3rd gen--fast enough I guess, but I expected a lot more (would not work well for gaming and speed driven apps).  Screen quality is acceptable but not as good as slightly more expensive HP laptop recently purchased for my wife (HP i5 is also faster).  Hardwear is nothing special, but does not look or feel overly cheap.  Large track pad that is pretty sensitive, but I use a mouse most of the time and the keyboard is a long reach if you are going to do a lot of typing (and I have long fingers).  Keys function well, but this is always a personal preference.  There is no signal light for \"NUM LOCK\" or \"CAPS\", can be a little annoying, but not that big a deal I guess.  Key backlighting is good. 1080 screen is OK but not all that sharp compared to other slightly more expensive brands.  Internet/browser connections are a bit sluggish, and I do not have a lot apps, and basic security software--this could be Microsoft and Chrome issue as much as the PC.  Actually my biggest complaint is how badly Office 365, especially Outlook perform, after a couple of months still have to reset often, and have not been able to consolidate my multiple mailboxes on Outlook 365--many, many bugs and I guess we can blame both MS and Acer for this.

The 10th gen i5 core and the 15 inch screen at ~$500 mark makes this an AMAZING value computer. Ultra thin and elegant design, but the laptop is heavier than it looks. Still very light compared to other laptops, at around 3.8 pounds. My main issue with this computer may have been a build issue, with the wifi randomly disconnecting every 5 to 10 minutes.

Reading the (fake) reviews of this product and seeing it was more positive than negative, we purchased the unit. Initially, like many reviews state (read the 1 star), it looked to be a good system. Then, over time, it started to get worse. We've not had any trackpad issues because we have this hooked to a television and use remote keyboard/mouse to interact, but it didn't take long to see why this unit is priced too good to be true. The components are cheap. I mean dirt cheap. I wouldn't be surprised if there isn't a name brand in the unit other than Intel, and I'd question even this at this stage. The biggest complaint we have is the graphics system. We cannot determine if the unit is just so cheap graphics suffer or if the unit is just not capable of dealing with online streaming. We specifically chose the UHD version to help keep costs down, and this should be sufficient for 1080p streaming. I don't think it is. The biggest issue we see is desyncing between video and sound, and it's annoying. A restart fixes the issue, but it shouldn't get to this point  given the specs of the unit.

I was constantly hitting the enter key in error and the arrow keys lost all functionality for me being crammed where they were. I went though two Zenbook 14\". The first was purchased through a 3rd party and was obviously an open box or refurb, despite not making that clear in their ad. Fingerprints all over the top of the case and it was missing the Ethernet adapter. I got the black screen of death while trying to update windows 10. I had it less than 8 hours and back into the box it went and returned. Pictures I added to this review are of the returned 14\" side by side with the 13\". I then purchased the Zen 14\" with screenpad and better graphics card....typing on it now...made sure not to purchase from 3rd party.  Third time is a charm ! It came brand new, no fingerprints with all accessories. It may only be nominally bigger but it's a world of difference to me. Difference in cost was $322.06. May not be worth it to some but it was to me. I am completely happy with my Zen 14. Don't think I'll really use the screenpad function but it looks cool. You won't be disappointed in the performance of the Zenbooks. I'm keeping my review at five stars as the laptop performed as it is supposed to.

It's cool that a num pad is built into the track pad, but even just the few seconds to turn on the num pad is enough for you to ignore it to just reach for the number keys instead. Also the track pad is too smooth imo, resulting in sliding across further than intended. The screen/resolution looked just a little odd to me. The screen would sometimes flicker in a way that was concerning, I was thinking something was wrong with it. Mine came with a very bad trackpad (the button part of it)--every 1/8 presses on the right button (representing a right click) would be registered as a left click or not at all!

For some strange reason, they put an NVIDIA sticker on the laptop even though it uses Intels integrated GPU, so don't let that fool you. I spent around 2 months looking for the best laptop for me and eventually purchased this one. I am pretty knowledgeable about computers and can safely say that this is an excellent laptop for the price. They keyboard is excellent and is easy to type on, with decent key travel and requires enough force where it is a pleasurable typing experience. I purchased this laptop expecting the numpad to be a gimmick, but to my suprise it works very well. Asus must have corrected the issue where the numpad was slow which caused most people to avoid using it all together. Also, to the reviews that claim the trackpad is glitchy and unpredictable, they are wrong or have an old touchpad driver installed. Overall, the touchpad/numpad are both very good and I have no complaints. The display is beautiful and the thin bezels make it an excellent viewing experience. Sharp image with good colors for a 1080p display, but nothing crazy. Speakers  are decent but you cant expect phenomenal speakers on a 13inch ultrabook. The build quality is excellent and feels very sturdy even though it weights 2.6 lbs. I have not tested the battery life but what I see online is 5-7 hours of use. The Bad: I have noticed from my brief time using it that it does get relatively warm quickly and the fan is not super quiet. Mine has a very slight coil whine but nothing too extreme. This is really the only \"complaint\" that I have this far and it really doesn't bother me too much. Overall, this laptop is an excellent choice and may be the best deal for the money. It is not perfect, but for the price, I seriously do not think you can find something better. I will update if I notice anything else. UPDATE: After using this computer for some time, I have very few bad things to say. My previous post stating that my laptop ran hot and had some coil whine is not the case, and only happened when I was setting up the computer. Since then, I have only heard the fan turn on a handful of times. The trackpad is quite small and sometimes locks up, but I also haven't updated the driver in a while so that may be my fault.

It's snappy, quick, and gets the job done in a slim formfactor with a beautiful small-bexel screen. Unfortunately, the screen is why I am RMAing my device (issue popped after Amazon 30-day return policy) and am giving this review two stars. On the minor side, there is an inconsistent screen backlight bleeding that especially visible when the display is a black color. This isn't super visible when the display is on normally, but it's definitely unusual for a screen, which screams \"cheaply manufactured panel.\" The major problem I have with the screen is that after one month of consistent use, there is a visible 1cm^2 yellow blotch on the bottom right side of my screen. This discolorzation is VERY visible and inidcates that the red and blue pixels (or magenta and cyan w/e) aren't working properly in that area. This is completely unacceptable for any screen panel. There are some good things that I do like out of the defects I mentioned. The laptop is fast and the NVMe drive it has really gives it a nice feel to it. The IR face scanner is well concealed in the slim top bezel and works quickly as expected. Battery life has been consistently decent with about 8-9 hours with moderate use. I don't do any photoediting (not my work) or gaming (it's a laptop), but performance has been acceptable overall. I'm currently in the process of geting this device fixed through ASUS' warranty service. I will update my review once the repairs to my device are complete. UPDATE: So, the entire RMA process, from shipment to and from their repair center, took about two and a half weeks. My screen panel was replaced and the new panel does not have any of the defects I saw in the first one. Overall, I'd rate the process as a solid \"okay\" for me since it was repaired somewhat quickly and effectively. Obviously, it would be optimal to not have to go through this process in the first place, but it seems like my unit was an outlier.

Never seen this problem in my life with a brand new item like this, I've had tons of laptops and working in IT for over 20 years.  Only thing I can think of is it got so hot charging, never felt a laptop ever before get that hot in such a short time, that it must have melted internal components.  I had to try running a fan on it when charging, unacceptable. So I liked their design but that's all it is.  It's a functional disaster and very poorly engineered and tested.

Photoshop, Premiere Pro open really fast. Paired with a portable SSD drive, thousands of photos and videos moved from one place to another with no lag. I just love that. It's a lovely looking piece. It's quiet because it's an SSD drive instead of a hard drive. (You'll want to have your files in the cloud and/or on a portable drive, is my recommendation, because there probably won't be room for your files and software.) The sound is very good (it is a laptop, so don't expect big room surround sound). The screen is clear and crisp with great color.

No worry though, I like the small size and the screen size is same as before just all the way to the edges. The Good: Screen is sharp, colors are good, very happy with display quality Build is solid- seems better than my last which suffered a broken off screen at the hinge (twice!) Video playback is great at high resolutions- no stutter Sound quality was surprisingly nice improvement over my previous model- very full sound. The facial ID to log in is truly a nice feature! Thought it would be gimmicky but works very well and saves me typing in a password each time I open my computer. Ports are just right- all the things that I need and in the right places Powersupply is quite a bit smaller than my previous- that is great! I put my computer in my bag everyday and travel with it often so that is helpful. Quite- nice! Fan stays well behaved unless working on something really intense. Not much sound working in a quite living room in the evening. The bad (or at least not so good!) Touchpad- not as sensitive as my previous ASUS and with all the fiddling around with settings in the world I am not thrilled with it. It often doesn't pick up my finger movement, sometimes misreads finger movement and opens things I didn't intend- or zooms when I didn't want to. Selecting things can be hit or miss. It is still usable, but I now appreciate just how good my last one was! NumberPad- well, I guess if you are an accountant you will appreciate this feature but I am not. This makes it more of an annoyance because it will come on accidentally quite often when using the trackpad and then takes a couple seconds of attention to turn back off. When on it starts inadvertently inserting numbers into my documents so has to be disabled each time. Talked to support and they said \"they are working on a shutoff but not possible now\" Finish- It looks beautiful, but whatever the treatment on the body is it tends to really pick up finger print oils and always looks pretty messy. Have to always give it a wipe before opening in front of clients. didn't have to do this with previous Asus Overall, I would recommend this computer, just beware of a couple of the limitations going in. I am a pretty heavy user of this thing as it doubles as my work and personal computer at home so it travels a lot, gets opened and closed a lot, and is running a good 12 hours a day both plugged in and on battery.

The number pad is a gimmick and not really something you will seriously use. This computer has some ability for light gaming but honestly I would not buy it for gaming. Also, don't work on this computer while it's charging. That will help with increasing the longevity of your device and prevent fan noise which I know bothers some people.

It's got great build quality and almost no flex at all, the thin bezels add to the look of the laptop and is a really nice touch, and the keyboard is real nice to type on. I like the rose-gold / gold above the keyboard as it adds a nice touch to the overall aesthetics, but it should've been a speaker grill instead of just an aesthetic feature. The trackpad number pad is a nice feature and I actually ended up using it more than I expected as it's right under my fingers and works great for entering in some quick numbers, whether it's for calculator, or an excel document. Windows hello facial recognition makes it much easier to sign in as it takes less than a second from opening the laptop lid, and so far I've had no issues with it. The laptop also came with a sleeve to carry it around in, which was surprising because it doesn't say it anywhere, but I'm not complaining. I love the small form factor of the laptop, because it seems like a 11-12 inch laptop at first glance but the screen is still 13 inches due to the thin bezels. Now, this laptop does come with a few cons. -The screen flickers every 10-15 minutes but is rarely noticeable, and the flickering rate isn't as high as what it was 2 weeks ago when I first got the laptop. Overall pretty easy to get used to, and I can live with it. -The trackpad sometimes jumps around or just stops working every now and then, but only lasts about a second or two. I normally use a mouse so this is no big deal for me, but it might be for some people. -The laptop chassis came warped, what I mean by this is you can clearly see a slight bend inwards towards the left of the keyboard. I didn't notice this until 2 days of having it and it was quite noticeable at first, but then I either got used to it or it fixed itself. I was pissed at first about this issue but then I came to realization that it really doesn't affect any typing. I haven't seen a lot of reviews that mention a warped chassis so I think it's a rare case. -The laptop has a USB type C port, but you can't charge through it and have to use the barrel type charger. This does affect me as I have type C on all of my devices and would've liked to have the convenience of carrying one cable for everything, but it really isn't that big of a deal. -Note that if you buy this from a country outside of the US, the charger plug is the US type and I had to buy a converter for mine. (not that big of a deal, thought I'd point it out) -Another thing worth noting about the charger, is that it isn't completely silent and there is some buzzing but you can barely hear it unless you put the power brick against your ear. I was considering buying an apple macbook charger as they make silent chargers but again, charging isn't possible through USB type C. -No thunderbolt 3: I'm not a person who takes advantage of thunderbolt 3 as I normally don't connect the laptop to high resolution/framerate displays or an external GPU, but it's worth noting if you take advantage of thunderbolt 3 -Backlight bleeding: This laptop has major backlight bleeding in black screens mostly, but is barely noticable otherwise. I don't mind it and I usually use it at half brightness anyways (it's most visible in full brightness). Now, these defects did bother me at first as I'm paying 1000 dollars for this and it comes with small issues that do get annoying when they add up, but these are compromises I can deal with as returning it really isn't an option for me at the moment as I need it for school and sold my old laptop. Overall I would've expected to not have these compromises at all when paying that price for a laptop but again, I can deal with them for the meantime."}, {"name": "larry39208", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2019", "title": "Perfect laptop", "review_text": "I've been wanting to upgrade my Windows laptop for quite a while as it was getting older and had slowed down to a crawl.

When it comes to form factor and hardware configuration, I think ASUS Zenbooks provides the best value for money hands down. That said, this model is ALMOST great, but falls slightly short. These are the reasons why: 1. Trackpad does not work smoothly and freezes from time to time. Not enough to affect usage, but enough to be somewhat annoying. 2 and 3 finger gestures also not as reliable (works 85% of the time) as previous models I have owned. I use a BT mouse so it does not affect me as much personally, but still... 2. Battery life is not as good as advertised. I would say around 6-8 hours of non-heavy use (browser, MS Office plus 1-2 more programs running at the same time). 3. Fan seems to keep spinning on and off for no apparent reason, without changing/opening additional programs. Not audible during the day but at night when I am working on the bed, this can be quite annoying. 4. In previous models, the LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN keys double as HOME/END/PG UP/PG DOWN keys with the FN key. These worked great when using keystrokes for browsing/navigation (like moving between tabs, going to top of the page) and when using Office products (like moving between Excel tabs, or going to the end of sentences/paragraphs in Word etc.). In this model, the same HOME/END/PG UP/PG DOWN keys are now moved to F9-F12. This makes no sense. I now have to move my fingers all the way to the top of the keyboard to reach them, which slows me down and defeats the purpose of using keystrokes to increase productivity. As a heavy user of spreadsheets and text editors, this really irked me. ASUS - WHY  CHANGE A GOOD THING??? Especially when the LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN keys ares not paired with any additional useful functions??? This is beyond stupid! I believe most of the issues I mentioned can be fixed with a BIOS update. So ASUS, if you are reading this, PLEASE PUBLISH AN UPDATED BIOS AND FIX THESE PROBLEMS!!! And if the BIOS update can bring the FN+ HOME/END/PG UP/PG DOWN back down to where they used to be (LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN ), that would be much appreciated."}, {"name": "Boris", "rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2020", "title": "An Asus laptop with top specs that leaves much to be desired, especially if keyboard is important", "review_text": "I have owned many Asus laptops, I like the brand overall. I think that they can make quality laptops. This one, however, left a lot to be desired... Although it had flashy new technological features like the touchpad which doubles as a screen, I wanted a touch-screen much mroe than a touch-screen laptop which really isn't very functional. The specs are amazing, but why doesn't the display go brigher in terms of overall nits of brightness? It also isn't a touch-screen, which almost should be mandatory for a laptop in late 2019. The specs are something to write home about, but the battery life is average, and I was having to reach for the charger more times than I liked. Another problem with this laptop was the speakers. My phone is louder than this laptop. I couldn't believe how quiet it actually was. Why build a laptop and include speakers that are not going to function well at all? I could hardly hear anything, and I was left reaching for headphones every time just to hear videos. Come on Asus, you're better than this@ But the worst feature of this laptop had to be the keyboard. Why build a quality laptop with such a tiny keyboard, with keys spaced so close together, and overall use of the keyboard was almost impossible for typing of long documents since my fingers had to be cramped so close together, making effective document editing and typing such a chore that after several months I had to return it. I now bought the HP Spectre 360, a laptop which extends a keyboard accross the entire bottom half of the laptop, includes a touchscreen which flips 360, a battery which doubles what the Asus does, specs on par to compete with this Asus laptop, and a price below that of this asus computer. It's everything I've wanted this Asus laptop to be, and everything it should have been, only much better. Loud speakers, touch screen, bright display, comfortable keyboard, lower starting price, and impressive memory features such as Intel Optane. I got lucky buying it on Cyber Monday, because now it is more than this laptop, but still worth it. They have the same footprint too. Sorry Asus, but you need to step your game up if you want to compete nowadays when other companies are producing machines leagues above your capabilities for prices under yours. Laptops nowadays deserve to have keyboards that work, speakers that are louder than phones, and screens that impress, especially with specs like the ones you include on your laptop.

Once on, screen had adequate brightness, but had a lot of light bleed around edges in very dark areas. To me, this is unacceptable in a higher end laptop. My cheap $275 laptop with narrow bezels has less bleed. Color was good - except for white color balance - more on that later.

I did find I could not remove certain \"icons\" from pad home screen - such as \"sheets\", \"slides\" etc., not completely customizable.

I personally cannot stand the default \"blue filter\" color balance most laptops are now sent with. To me, white should be white, not a greenish / reddish tint. I found that after balancing the white in advanced settings, the settings would not remain upon restart.

The Screenpad is an innovative design combining the best parts of a touch-pad, a macro-key add-on, and a small second screen. My only issue here is that, because you have to switch between these functions, it causes pauses in work-flow as you switch between them. This is particularly true when switching on the track-pad function to move around the screen and then back to whatever other function you were using on the Screenpad. However, the software design for these functions is excellent. There's even a quick, temporary switch to make it easier. It's only the fact that it needs doing at all that slows things down. Once you learn the ways to move things between screen and pad, it's very easy to do. I actually wish there were more Screenpad apps. (There are just a few.) But the ones there are work quickly and well. The main screen is bright and readable and the extremely small bezel makes it look even nicer. It's only 1920x1080 but for a 13-inch laptop, that's not bad. It isn't a touch screen. I caught myself reaching up to the screen to touch it a few times. Having a touch screen might have solved the issue I had with switching functions on the Screenpad. The combination of a powerful processor, a decent graphics card, and a solid-state storage drive makes this device agile and responsive. The graphics card has only 2GB RAM, which isn't enough to support use in Premier Pro or After Effects GPU-based rendering without a trick but it's enough to handle most every other task. The 16GB internal memory was great for all kinds of tasks. The port allotment for the device is excellent. 1 USB-c 3.1 v2 port, 1 USB-a 3.1 v2 port, and 1 USB-a 3.1 v1 port make it possible to connect all kinds of add-ons without a separate hub. The built-in HDMI port is very nice to have too. Finally, a full stereo out and microphone in audio jack is great to have. It also supports WiFi (though not version 6) and BlueTooth for non-wired connection. I do wish that it had a USB-c power connection since all of my existing power bricks are that type. The former standard barrel power connector is OK, but the power brick is of a substantial size. It would be nice to replace it with one of the newer, smaller GAn models. All-in-all its a great device even given the caveats above. I notice that it has a sibling model where the Screenpad is located above the keyboard and the touchpad is a separate device. I like that design better even with the $400 difference in price. Consider whether you intend to use it with a mouse all the time or whether you'd find switching between trackpad and other functions a bottle-neck. If that's not a problem, this is a good, workable device."}, {"name": "Todd Jones", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2020", "title": "Excellent choice for advanced users and developers", "review_text": "This is one of the few laptops with a second display, which can be used to view sample code or important information while developing software or working on writing assignments or homework.  You can leave your word assignment open on the screenpad and browse with the main display. It has some connectivity issues with wifi where you need to use the included ethernet dongle that comes with the laptop or you're out of luck, so it can directly connect to the router to update or download your router drivers. The screenpad has a bit of a learning curve to it and needs to be updated, and the settings have to be adjusted for it to work properly.  I have the 10th gen i7 13 inch ux334f with nvidia graphics 16 gig ram and 500 gigs SSD which is perfect mix for modern tasks.  It's smaller and tough design makes it great for every day carry and is sleek enough to sneak between books in its included case and doesn't look disruptive in a class environment. I also have multiple secondary storage devices that I can easily switch between to free up, transfer or supplement memory.  Once you figure it out you can get pretty fast at switching between the touchpad and main display and using it to launch your favorite apps.  It works best with a connected lightweight jellycomb bluetooth keyboard and mouse which you can score for about 15$ for on the go work but you would still need a full USB keyboard and mouse for gaming.  I have waited years to buy a  laptop, and I haven't been disappointed so far.  Perfect if you have a desktop and you need to take work with you and have the capability to work and bypass technical failures of other devices on the go. I have had it for about 3 months.  It is exactly what I was looking for as a back up and supplement workhorse middle ground between a phone and a desktop that is much snappier than my other 2 desktops for overall browsing and app usage, however it will overheat if you run the graphics too hard gaming in CSGO SC2 or newer titles and the battery will die relatively quickly with intense usage or if you leave it on or forget to charge."}, {"name": "julian", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2019", "title": "Lots of wrongs with this laptop", "review_text": "I was expecting a good laptop, given that I've used Asus laptops before.

Hughes", "rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2017", "title": "Solid Chromebook, but far from \"Premium\"", "review_text": "I have to start off by saying that I'm a Chromebook fan. I've tested several and owned a few. There are still apps (when I was growing up, we called them \"programs\" and \"software\") that will only run on a PC, but I try when possible to take a Chromebook with me wherever I go because they are just so damn handy. Why is this important? Because this review is not here to hate on Chromebooks. They are great little machines. Many reviews hate the OS, and don't focus on the hardware when writing their reviews. Unfortunately, this 2017 Acer Flagship CB3-532 15.6\" HD \"Premium Chromebook\" is not really \"premium.\" For two Benjamins, it's still a better computer than NASA had for all the Apollo missions-- in the space crafts and on the ground combined. But I was expecting more. I have a 2015 Asus 10\" Chromebook which outperforms this 2017 15\" Chromebook, and they were both the same price. I was hoping to \"trade-up\" but it looks like I'll keep the mini Chromebook and just use this 15\" Chromebook as a spare at the office. My Chromebook arrived refurbished, and I knew that going in when I purchased it. But sadly, mine arrived with schmutz all over the case (mainly on the bottom, and along the sides). The screen and keyboard were (thankfully) clean. But the rest of the case was honestly gross. We're talking about dirt, skin oils, and maybe food stains. I don't know what. Someone should have wiped this down with a rag before shipping it. It was absolutely disgusting to receive it with visible stains and foreign material on it. The screen quality is decent-enough. Technically, it may be \"HD,\" but it doesn't pop with color and brightness like many other HD screens. Reading emails, the text is kind of soft and fuzzy compared to my Asus PC latpop screen and Asus 10\" Chromebook. I'd give the Acer 15\" screen a 7/10 in the visual department. Again, not bad for the price, but certainly not up-to-par with other laptop screens we're now seeing. The speakers are awesome. Not only are they of good quality, but they face up! Frankly, it should be international law that all laptops have upward facing speakers so that we can actually hear them. The keyboard is excellent. Feels pro-quality, and it's not too loud (some cheap laptops have a clickity-clack problem). Could use this on a plane in first class and not disturb the blue-blood next to you with his poodle and monocle. Where this Chromebook really fails is in power. Now, I'm not expecting Cray Supercomputer here (have I dated myself yet?), but I was disappointed when I tried to run 4k video from YouTube. It was a complete no-go. Not entirely unexpected, but I was hoping a \"premium\" Chromebook could handle it. What's more disappointing is that it hiccuped a bit even on 1080 HD video from YouTube. That's no bueno. I tried watching a couple videos on this Chromebook and compared it to my PC, and the Chromebook just didn't have the mojo or gusto or eye of the tiger. In summary, this Chromebook is a good value overall, but it's far from premium. For the price, it's a worthy contended, But if you like to watch HD Netflix or other streaming film, I think I'd look for another laptop of Chromebook with better video capabilities. UPDATE: The day this refurbished model was delivered, I noticed that Walmart had brand new ones for less money.

That means it is a laptop running Google\u2019s Chrome OS. The operating system is fast and very user friendly. One thing that people will complain about is the amount of space that the laptop comes with. It\u2019s about 15gb. Before you freak out about that, let me explain WHY the storage is so small. Chromebooks use what are called web apps. That means you don\u2019t need to (or more accurately, can\u2019t) download programs. That being said, don\u2019t expect to be downloading games and movies. The battery life is about 12 hours (unless you use the computer the way I do. I\u2019ll explain later) The camera looks good, albeit slightly grainy. Well, when it\u2019s not skipping frames. With the main focus being on web apps, that would mean that you have to be online constantly to make the most use of the laptop. There are of course, a few offline comparable apps that you can find in the Chrome Web Store if you ever find yourself without connection. If you want to unlock the full potential (and very quickly run up your memory) you can take advantage of the fact that ChromeOS is Linux based and install Ubuntu.

I don't mean that in a bad way; that's just what the product is.  I wanted something for lite to medium duty, basic everyday online activity and my work as an online tutor.  I write a lot, so a lot of online research, and watch a lot of videos I've downloaded else where.  I figured this would be good for all that, and I think I was right.  You basically have functionality like a tablet:  Everything is done by, on or through the web, including storage.  You can't install programs, this thing has no hard drive.  You CAN download apps from the Google Play Store, and you will find most of what you want for free.  I was worried that I wouldn't be able to watch videos that I downloaded elsewhere on a USB drive, but it works fine.  Haven't tried music like that yet, or ebooks....the latter of which I doubt if there is any way to open unless they were purchased on this machine. This Chromebook is light, but I wouldn't say it feels durable; I wouldn't recommend you give it the slam test to see how it holds up.  Doesn't seem fragile...but it's plasticy, and that's to be expected. The one thing I DON'T like about it is the power adapter plug.  As we all know, this is the most blatant, in-your-face, ongoing scam on laptop users and has been since the beginning:  The whole machine depends on an unsupported, usually not well insulated, it's gonna break from stress not how but when plug in the side of the computer.  The plug always sticks out just BEGGING to take a hit from something, or be the point of impact in a drop.  Just plugging this one in feels like an act of senseless optimism; it is seriously a dainty little mini-plug in a plastic housed plug in the traditional back left side of the machine.  Sooner or later, the ground will come loose inside, and that's that.  It is total BS the manufacturers don't design this better.  But, that's what they want:  When it fails, and it will, the consumer gets the blame for it, and then you gotta buy a new machine.  Can they do better?  Ever see a Mac?  The magnetic connector they use solves all those problems; anything pulls on it, it just magnetically disconnects.  Anything pulls on one of these, and you suck up your seat pants until you see if the plug or the connection has been ruined.  It's just a matter of time before I'm propping the plug up with something to make it work, then one day....bzzt.  Gotta get a new machine because replacing the charger input port is more time and trouble and money than it's worth. But, that said, virtually all laptops have that issue.  The manufacturers see it as a built in way to keep selling new machines, and the consumer can't do anything about it.  So is it fair to criticize this machine for a systemic flaw in ALL laptops (except Macs)?  Eh, you decide. Overall, I'm perfectly happy with this thing.  I did some research and knew exactly what I was getting, and it's what I expected.  So I'm perfectly down with that.  But if you're expecting the full functionality of a full laptop computer (which most people waste 90 percent of the potential of, anyway), you may be frustrated or underwhelmed.  If you're expecting a cheap, functioning Chromebook with no obvious design flaws or inherent shortcomings, you'll probably be like me:  I'm not thrilled to the point of squealing and clapping my hands like a six year old girl that just got a newest Barbie for Christmas, but I didn't expect I would be.  This thing is cheap, a good value, gets exactly the job done that I bought it for, and should last long enough to be a solid value.  Nothing magical here, just a good value, if tablet functionality with a focus on online features if what you need. Except that GD power plug.  But we're all stuck in that slowly sinking ship.

I like my apps better, but apps don't work on this thing, despite what the OS description said.  If you want to access an app or service, its done through your Chrome browser, not the androidapp. 3)  My biggest complaint about this computer is the keyboard.  The genius who designed the keyboard put the SEARCH button directly to the left of the A key.  Since there is no number pad, any experienced typer will have to reorient their typing stance from a center-left position to a dead-center position.  Its extremely cumbersome using the keyboard despite its full size.  Additionally putting the search button directly to the left of the A key is so annoying I'm actually considering prying the key off so I stop accidentally pressing it.  If that search button wasnt in such a stupidly designed location, this would be a 3 star review. The main redeeming value of this computer, and only reason its not a 1 star review is the ease of use in terms of the Chrome OS.  If you know chrome, you already know the computer.

I find no reason why a 6 mo. old, newly serviced laptop only lasted 6 mo!!!! All I did was surf the web for information and to shop on Amazon. Never dropped it. Never spilled anything on it. Never slammed it shut. Always kept a good charge on it. One evening I was gathering thanksgiving recipes, shut it down for only about a half hour, went to finish my recipe searches and BAM the sob is DEAD. I used my reliable kindle fire 5 to find possible troubleshooting steps to follow. Yes sir,,,I screwed myself by not buying the extended warranty, but 30/90 day return warranties are geared for this situation. To force another purchase!!!!!! I will not purchase or recommend an acer product nor use Amazon for the future replacement of this laptop. Again, I see NO REASON why our technologies could turn out such a short lived product."}, {"name": "Kimya", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2018", "title": "Good affordable computer", "review_text": "The laptop is great but if you have it closed sometimes it shuts off unexpectedly, so when you turn it back on you have to restore the tabs you had open."}, {"name": "Ashley Pierson", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2020", "title": "A blessing in disguise!", "review_text": "I love my laptop!

First, these are used and refurb.  With that in mind, I could not tell by scratches, dings or outward signs that this was used.  Its almost flawless.  The packaging is generic and YES it does come with a power supply, look through your box.  In about 2 hours it was fully charged and had a few updates to get.  As is with all chromebooks, the updates were fast.  Much faster than PC.  The item was about half the weight of my Windows laptop PC and this thing stays nice and cool.  I like the controls of the Chromebook, the keys are fair and the pad works very well.  Upward speakers are very nice and sound better than my PC. As I read in other reviews, this IS a chromebook and not designed for multiple open screens running multiple things.  If you keep that in mind, you will probably never have any noticed slow downs.  I started running FB, Instagram and Youtube at the same time, and it got a bit skippy.  But one or two screens without any special high demand items running and this is a fine.  The screen is awesome.  Clear, clean, HD etc etc.  The external memory add on is different from another different model I have had.  You cannot easily add to memory, though you can plug and play a memory stick or card that will protrude from the right side.  If you have high memory items to save, do it to a stick, the cloud or something else.  And, as usual, it picked up my Chrome stuff via Google supremely fast and complete.  So website history, favorites etc were all just there.  Printing set up was 2 seconds! POSITIVES: Clean sharp BIG screen Easy and fast set up Sensitive pad Like new condition great sound incredible price Battery life is very impressive (3 hours down to 73%) Fast charging Wifi super fast and easy to set up. The value cannot be understated CONS: Not great at multi tasking/heavy memory usage items.  Sure, write, presentation and regular apps.  Multimedia eats memory fast. Mostly just on line (all Chromebooks) No easy memory upgrades (unless you can open her up, but I didnt try)"}, {"name": "bethani", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2018", "title": "Ah, almost like having a Mac", "review_text": "Finally, something easy to get around on!

I purchased a new version (not refurbished) of the computer for $159.99. I have only had this computer for about 6 months and I have had continuous problems since I bought it. Most recently, I have noticed a high pitched buzzing noise coming from the computer that I cannot figure out how to get rid of. It is extremely irritating when I am trying to work - I work from home in a quiet environment so it is easy to hear. The only thing that helps drown it out is by playing music. However! The computer is set up to have \"apps\". I downloaded the Spotify app thinking that would work but it always freezes, lags, and then shuts down. So instead I have to play from my browser using the webplayer. I have excellent internet that works quickly with all of my other devices but my internet always seems to lag on my computer. I rarely use any of my devices at the same time other than using my phone while watching streaming services. I bought this computer to use for my business, however, it has proven to not be what I need. The computer in general is slow, lags a ton, and randomly shuts off at times. I was excited about having a computer that was google chrome enabled, but that perk usually is more annoying than it is helpful. I cannot tell you how often I accidentally hit the search button on the keyboard and then it takes me out of the window that I am using. I do not have a ton of items stored on my computer - I primarily use Google Drive. So the fact that my computer is so slow despite having little storage usage is somewhat annoying. A couple of things that I can say good about this computer: 1. The size is good 2. Sound quality is overall pretty good 3. Battery life is surprisingly good 4. The computer is in general light!

I was looking for a laptop that I can use for work, travels easy, but can afford me some game time when I am on the road.  Budget wasn\u2019t really an issue, but I wanted to make sure I was getting the most value for what I spent.  I do not do intensive work applications on it just email, excel, general surfing etc.  I am not a competitive gamer, so getting that extra millisecond of response time was not a concern but I wanted something that could handle current games and most games that will come out over the next couple of years. What I considered / compared it too? GPU \u2013 GTX 1650 \u2013 this thing rocks, most comparisons were to the older (but still capable) 1050i and other variations.  I wanted the newest I could get for the cost.  So this was the bench mark of my search. Processor \u2013 9th gen i5 \u2013 I really wanted to get a 9th gen i7 but, most of the ones that had it only had the 1050 series of graphics card, and as I stated above that\u2019s what I really valued most. NOTE: Lenovo DOES make a version of this with a gen 9 i7, it is not available (at the time of writing this) on Amazon. It IS available on Lenovo\u2019s website for about $180 more than this unit (on sale for $270 off ATM), but it comes with a smaller SSD.  I know its easier to replace an SSD than a GPU (basically impossible on a laptop like this) but between the cost difference and not having to hassle with adding an SSD right when I received it, that\u2019s why I decided against that route. NOTE: the benchmark testing on a gen 9 i5 vs i7 were very close in most tests, while future proofing your purchase is a good idea, it didn\u2019t look like a big enough difference (4 cores 8 threads on the 5 vs 6 cores 12 threads on the 7) to move me to spend more. NOTE: This laptop model might be an Amazon exclusive because I could not locate it on the Lenovo web site. Monitor refresh \u2013 60Hz \u2013 this was a tough one for me, there are some laptops that have the 9th gen i7, 16gb ram and the 1650 graphics card with 144Hz monitor (and there is a difference, just watch some youtube videos on it) but that cost difference was about $450.  For the games I play (will get to that in a second), the look, and the weight of the product, I just couldn\u2019t pull the trigger on the extra costs. RAM \u2013 8GB \u2013 documents state that you can upgrade the single 8GB stick to 16GB. 16GB DDR4 is about 70 bucks, if I get into a game that is giving me performance issues, I am ok with that upgrade cost. NOTE: Lenovo says you should use an authorized tech to upgrade your RAM/SSD or you might void the warranty.  I am not sure of the legality of that due to the right to self-repair, but I have done enough that it doesn\u2019t concern me, your views/value my differ from mine in this respect. 512gig SSD \u2013 I definitely wanted an SSD, boot speeds etc are totally worth it. 512 means I can fit about 6+ of today\u2019s modern games on it comfortably.  I am ok with that for now.  It does have an extra 2.5\u201d bay for another SSD (I have a 1TB from my old laptop so if I get to the point where I need it, it won\u2019t cost me anything extra, obviously your experience will differ from mine in that additional cost).  The extra bay is nice because you do not have to reload the OS etc, you can add the drive and increase your storage easily.  The NOTE above on the RAM upgrade applies here too. The Look \u2013 As I mentioned I will be using this for work too, this is as discrete of a \u201cgaming\u201d laptop as I have seen.  I did not want flashy lights or gaming brand logos on the cover.  I have the power to game; I don\u2019t need or want to flaunt it in my day job interacting with customers. Keyboard backlight \u2013 has 3 settings, off, low, high.  I play in a pretty dark room and the low setting was perfect to let me see while not blinding my peripheral vision. Heat \u2013 this is not a loud laptop (fans); I have been gaming on laptops for 10 years an have had my fair share of jet engines.  This doesn\u2019t appear to be one of those.  It does get warm, but nothing of concern or that would burn to the touch. Battery life \u2013 I haven\u2019t tested it yet completely (will update when I do) but in \u201ceconomy\u201d mode (not using the 1650 graphics card) it looks to last 5+ hours, the description says 9 hours but I doubt that, still its more than enough for when I can\u2019t plug in.  Running with the 1650 turned on and gaming I would get around 2 hours. Bloat \u2013 amazingly it didn\u2019t come with much on it that I had to remove.  MacAfee and a Lenovo thing, that\u2019s about it. What games do I play on it? No Man\u2019s Sky Beyond \u2013 Played on high settings with no issues/lag/clipping at all WoW \u2013 Ultra settings with no issues (obviously its an older games graphics wise) Overwatch \u2013 Ultra Settings with no issues As I play and test more games ill update this\u2026.. 9/29/19 EDIT - Borderlands 3 - 30 FPS on Ultra, dialed back to medium and was more than great for my average gamer needs. 11/30/19 EDIT - Thrown a ton of games at this over the past few months.  Basically anything made before 2018 you can run at max with no issues.  Most newer games (2019 releases) will run just fine at med/high settings. What about the backlight/bleeding reports? Ill knock on wood, I have not seen bleeding on the edges for darker games, or I might just not be noticing it.  backlight/monitor darkness, again, I have not experienced this, and I hope I don\u2019t.

The i5-9300h will pretty much be able to do anything except for the heaviest tasks, while the GTX 1650 can handle a large variety of games, though the most graphics intense games will need medium to low settings. While there are only 8 GB of RAM, in my usage (internet browsing, college work, occasional gaming) that has never been a problem. Again, this isn't the absolute most powerful laptop, but it is probably far above average in performance. Battery life is surprisingly good for a gaming laptop, especially if you undervolt (which I did by -125 mV if you're interested), and it runs relatively cool as well, rarely going over 80 C. I personally really like the minimalist design, with blue accents instead of the \"gamer\" red, so this won't turn too many heads in a professional meeting. The screen bezels are relatively small too, and while apparently the color gamut is not the best, that either doesn't matter or isn't even apparent to me (in case you saw reviews criticizing this). Maybe if you're in graphic design, this might matter, though. The hinge is strong, and can bend all the way to 180 degrees. It's not a touchscreen laptop, but there are some uses, such as watching a video in bed or something. The system is also really slim for a gaming laptop, and easy to carry around, which is an excellent design choice. The build quality isn't the best, being mostly plastic, but it is still smooth to feel, so there is at least that. The keyboard isn't very clicky, and the travel distance is a little small. It takes a while to get used to, but eventually you may get used to it. The backlit keyboard is nice, though. The trackpad unfortunately uses garbage Synaptics drivers. I played around with the registry a bit to add a couple gestures, but coming from Windows Precision, the trackpad is definitely a massive downgrade from Precision for me. I tried installing Precision drivers, and they worked (excellently, I might add) temporarily, because I guess Windows update has something in place to really latch you on to Synaptics drivers. Although there are definitely some sacrifices made (including some that I haven't mentioned, such as needing to buy a separate cable if you want to add a hard drive or having only one slot for RAM), I think that on balance this laptop provides fantastic value for $680.

I didn't test it in much games, All I have tested is Total War Warhammer II and it has stable 50+ FPS on ultra settings. With these specs I think it is a good deal. There is not much more I can say about laptop. Upgradability: - Processor is soldered to system board. - There is only one slot for RAM. - There is no bracket and cable for additional hard drive and I couldn't find spare on Lenovo Parts Finder. My huge complaint is about Lenovo Representative who answers questions here on Amazon. Answering questions he said that there is extra slot for additional RAM stick. Here is the link to that answer: https://www.amazon.com/ask/questions/Tx1QTL71H6BKS5Z/ref=ask_dp_dpmw_al_hza. That is a lie. There is no additional slot for RAM on this board. There is only one slot with 8 Gb stick installed so if you want, like me, upgrade this Laptop to 16 Gb of RAM you need to buy 16Gb stick. I'm very disappointed by this because after I read Q&A section I ordered another 8Gb stick along and now I stuck with 2 extra 8Gb sticks after I upgrade laptops memory. Also, Lenovo Rep mentioned couple of times that laptop is not user serviceable. I don't know why did he said that. Bottom cover is held by 11 screws and comes off easily, after you slightly pry latches. (2 for each side spaced evenly) and there you have access to RAM, coolers (in case you need to clean them) and SSD. ( By the way there is short version installed, but it is possible to install long SSD stick, as it has screw mounts for different sizes). You can find service manual with diagrams on Lenovo site in support section. Finally I want to recommend to undervolt your CPU and GPU. BUT ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DOING. IF YOU MESS WITH WRONG SETTING YOU COULD END UP WITH TOASTED CPU OR GPU.

My only major complaint is that the USB-C connection does NOT support HDMI over USB. It's only a Gen 1 USB 3.1 controller and outputs just 5Gbit/s - far short of what's needed to drive a monitor or two. The built-in HDMI connection works just fine, but I'd have preferred the ability to use an all-in-one dock so it's a bit disappointing for a newer generation laptop to have such an old USB controller.

I eventually settled on this laptop and after 48 hours of use I am very satisfied with its performance. Granted I can speak for it's longevity just yet but below are my initial impressions after using it working from home and trying out some games. Pros: -It's fast. My previous laptop had maybe half the RAM and I really notice a significant performance boost compared to other laptops I've used. The startup time from powering on to actually being able to use is very quick (under 1 min). I've had several programs running at the same time with no noticeable lag. -Decent gaming laptop. I haven't run anything super intense on this machine as of yet but the few games I have played have performed very well. I was able to run Shadow of Mordor on high settings with no lag at all. When I bench tested the game it was consistently running around 80 fps. Also, It was also incredibly easy to plug in and play with an Xbox one control, no installing drivers or anything. -Very few \"freeware\" programs. This isn't something I normally think of until I start actually using a new laptop but most PCs are pre-loaded with a bunch of junk programs that slow it down and never get used. This came with barely anything pre-installed which saved me the headache of going through the program list and trying to figure out what isn't essential. Cons -Only 2 USB ports. Not a huge deal but if you use an external mouse with this laptop like I do it really only leaves you with 1 functional USB port. -Paying for a \"gaming\" laptop. This might sound like a weird complaint for what is advertised as a gaming laptop but essentially what you're paying for is the Nvidia Geforce GTX chip. I saw a number of other laptops with very similar specs that were $200 cheaper because it wasn't a \"gaming\" laptop. But still, if your main priority for getting this machine is for a low-end gaming rig it is still a good deal. Recommendation: If you are looking for a high-end gaming laptop that can play triple A titles at max specs you may want to get something with more RAM. However, if you are looking for a multi-purpose office PC that can also run games it is fantastic. Overall very satisfied with this purchase.

It's a nice looking laptop. It's a modest looking laptop without much of an obnoxious \"gamer\" look to it. The build quality on it feels nice and the keyboard is good. It also comes with a little privacy shutter for the camera. The touchpad on it has some issues, which I'll get to later. I initially bought this laptop for its specs. The i5-9300H that it comes with does quite nicely with a lot of the stuff I work with, especially emulation. It also comes with a GTX 1650, which pairs well. Unfortunately, it only comes with 8GBs of RAM. It only has one RAM slot, which makes upgrade options limited and preventing dual channeling; I only know this from word of mouth, and I can't verify it myself as I don't want to void my warranty by opening my laptop. Now, onto some minor nitpicks. The screen is a bit dark, although it's not too much of an issue for me. The sound quality on the speakers are decent, but not that great. The battery life is also okay; it gets about five hours with casual usage, and a little under an hour with gaming. The performance on this laptop is also reduced when on battery, so you might as well keep it plugged in when gaming. The F1-F12 buttons have some functions assigned to them (adjusting volume, brightness, etc.), which get in the way sometimes. It's annoying when I try to press Alt-F4 to close a window only to have it mute the microphone instead. Luckily, this can adjusted in the BIOS so that you have to hold the FN button to use these functions (which should've been the default setting in the first place). Now, onto the biggest issue. The touchpad is absolutely horrible. It's hard to describe, but the momentum on it doesn't feel right. When I try to transition from moving slowly to quickly, the mouse doesn't follow my finger quite right; it's hard to move precisely because of this. I do have a USB mouse on hand, but I honestly prefer to use touchpads, which is why this is such a nuisance for me. It's not even a hardware issue either; it comes from the lack of implementation of Windows's precision touchpad drivers. Lenovo could've issued a simple software update to fix this, but they refuse to do so. If they do fix it, I'd be perfectly willing to up this to a four star review. Bottom line, get a USB mouse if you're going to buy this laptop. Now, while we're on the subject of purchasing, I believe the original price point for this laptop is somewhere among the lines of $800-900. The specs are great, but I can't recommend it at that price because the design cuts too many corners on a lot of the peripherals (especially the touchpad). It seems like Amazon is selling them for a little under $700, which I suppose is a much more reasonable price."}, {"name": "Steven", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2019", "title": "Works great!", "review_text": "A superb gaming laptop, but I actually bought it for engineering grad school.

The only reason I am giving this product a review that is good (I usually only review products if I have something bad to say) is that I feel it is misrepresented by the bad reviews. Only a small portion of the reviews for this computer are negative, and more people who have bad luck will leave reviews than those who have good luck. So consider that before you think that the 20% of reviews that account for this computer not having a 5 star overall score make up probably 5% or less of people who actually had issues with this computer after purchasing it. Ok, on to my review This computer is better than any other that I have used or owned before it. Thats not saying much because I got it as an upgrade  to a  10 year old macbook. However, some of the reviews complained about the screen not having good color, and I dont really think thats true. Also, there were complaints about the keyboard, which feels really good in my opinion, and about the flimsiness of the plastic that its made of. I understand that a computer with an aluminum shell would be better, but that is expensive and heavy, and the plastic that lenovo used doesn't seem flimsy. Cosmetically, I love the computer, and the screen seems very good quality. The main reason I wanted this computer was for editing with premeire pro, which I could not even use on my old computer. Premeire runs very well, and I have installed a few games on it as well which I feel might help some people make desicions about whether it is \"beefy\" enough for their gaming needs.  I have been running forza horizon 3 with max graphics settings, and the framerate average is around 50 to 60 frames per second, which is better than I expected for a $700 laptop. The other game I have been running, which some people might be less familiar with is the drone racing league simulator. This game, when on max graphics settings, has realistic lighting and amazing amounts of detail, and I have had no issues running it at 60 fps all the time with max graphics (the game is very fast paced so it has a framerate warning if you drop below 60). I can't give an accurate estimate as to battery life yet, because I've only had it for a few days and haven't tested the battery yet. I would guess that you could probably get 5-6 hours if you are web browsing, and 1-3 hours gaming, depending on how demanding the game is.

At an unpredictable pattern the latency spikes, the game stops interacting with the host servers, and you can't do anything. The computer is not frozen, you can minimize and run other tasks just fine. The game itself is not frozen, other players are playing just fine on the same servers without issue. It seems to be the onboard WiFi adaptor itself. So I sent a support case to Amazon. They asked a few questions, concluded I had received a defective product, and gave me a shipping label to exchange it. (Downside: No laptop during competition) New laptop arrived a few days later and still has the same issue. This leads me to believe it's not a defective product, but more likely a low quality WiFi adaptor onboard causing the issue. I now use the laptop for less time sensitive tasking. I may end up buying a USB WiFi adaptor later and seeing if that results in better performance. The drawback there is that there are only 2 USB ports on the laptop.

It's not been an issue with 15 years of multiple personal and work laptops of every brand. So to say I'm frustrated right now is an understatement. I *think* the solution is to uninstall the bad touchpad driver it came with and reinstall a new one, but not being a tech person I'm paying to bring it to someone who is so I don't break anything!

It might just be very inaccurate. This is another thing that can be fixed easily by buying a wireless mouse. Third, it is a finger print magnet.

If your expectations are reasonable (i.e. don't expect to find a large screen, don't expect to run intense programs or games) then I think you will be happy with this. The notebook comes with Windows 10S (not windows 10) which can be upgraded free and easily.  If the upgrade is not made, then you are limited to the programs/apps in windows' store which is not very comprehensive.  The only issue here is that the Windows 10 version the upgrade goes to is 64 bit (not 32) which has compatibility issues with some older programs. I found the eMMC disk drive to be fast, the computer boots in a few seconds.  There is a Micro SD slot.  256GB micro sd card is only around $25 and is immensely helpful in increasing available storage (buy a name brand only; i.e. microcenter, sandisk, pny, crucial, kingston, etc etc).  The internal eMMC drive or the RAM can not be upgraded. WiFi is strong, the screen is only 11.5\" but is very bright and has very good resolution and color.  The USB ports are V 3.x.  The keyboard does not feel cramped or compromised in any way despite the small size of the notebook.  Too bad it does not have a trackpoint which would be very helpful in navigating more precisely on the small screen. I have only had this so far for a week so I can not comment on durability.  The card slot seems a bit flimsy. I have been unable to get anything near the \"whole day\" claim on a battery charge.  6 hours is about it but obviously that is still very good.

Looks good, feels as solid as one can expect, nice response feel on the keys, crisp display and bright, and lightning fast... for a reason. First things first, I ripped Windows out of this mini laptop shortly after powering it up. Why? Windows is a memory and resource hog. Secondly, the amount of information they want just to run the laptop outside Windows S mode is ridiculous. Hence, Windows had to go, so it I took it out. In place of Windows I installed Manjaro Linux, based off the Arch Linux distro, using the Xcfe interface system. Both are considered light weight and just seemed perfect for this mini laptop. The OS slid right in without a single problem, it picked up all the hardware on boot-up, and the response times proved better than I hoped. As a test of the battery, I loaded up Youtube with 15 hours of videos and let it run. After nearly exhausting the 15 hours of videos, the laptop battery finally gave up. It impressed me since it played for 14 hours and 27 minutes non-stop. Moreover, the speakers sounded much better than I thought they would. A little tinny, but what could anyone really expect? The laptop never got too warm, either, considering it is a fanless system. It just powered through without a hiccup. After ten days of regular use it seems rock solid. The shakedown period ran without a hitch. The distro comes with automatic updates, so the OS is kept fresh and update. The WiFi range is quite good. I remained connected to my WiFi for just about fifty feet, and the signal needed to pass through walls. The camera is okay, but to be honest I do not use it much if at all. I simply tested it. At just over two pounds, it travels well in my backpack and I use it during my commutes to and from the office. LibreOffice runs like a champ. GIMP runs like a champ. Audicty runs like a champ. KPatience is quick and fun. Firefox with extensions is incredibly fast... faster than on my main desktop. This is a great little mini laptop and, with the Manjaro OS changes, is worth more than purchase price. I highly recommend it since it proved so amenable to modification. I would definitely buy again. 6 Months Later... I still love this mini-laptop. I use it almost every day. Mostly I use it for writing, streaming music to a Bluetooth speaker, and a little web surfing, and I could not be happier with this machine. I made the right choice of swapping out the OS.

I can't find enough good things to say about this portable powerhouse. I'm a pretty hardcore gamer who also uses a lot of graphics intensive programs like Photoshop and Unreal 4. This laptop... is not for that. It's for those times away from your high-end programs, where you need 10 chrome tabs open in a coffee shop while you're experimenting with Microsoft Word layouts. It's for when you're out in the woods and want to sort and organize the photos on your camera's SD right then and there. It's for trips where you want to travel light, but still want the world at your finger tips. OK, OK, enough flowery language. Let's get to the pros / cons: Pros: -The keyboard feels great, with a nice balance of being chunky and \"clicky\" while still being compact. Once you get used to its size, it's pretty easy to get close to your fastest typing speeds with minimal errors. -This thing is really light. Maybe I'm too sued to heavier laptops, but seriously, this thing is effortless to bring around. Throw it in a backpack, tuck it under your shoulder, do whatever. This thing is pretty durable from what I can tell, so all that lightness doesn't come at the cost of having to gingerly secure it in a special compartment. Any ol' laptop bag / pocket will do! -The battery life is great! Maybe I'm too used to being tethered to outlets by more power-hungry machines, but I was able to get hours of typing and Chromeing out of this thing. The key I've found (as with most machines) is to keep the brightness a bit low when you're not plugged it, it can make a big difference. -ASUS has always made my favorite laptops and this one is no exception. If you're a fan of ASUS' work, you'll find everything you know and love about and ASUS packed into a tiny package. -The ports, lordy, the ports! So many ports in such a tiny machine. -The screen is far brighter and more colorful than I was expecting. My other laptop is a \"state-of-the-art\" ROG Strix II, with a high color accuracy, high refresh-rate display... the issue is they never calibrate said displays and they always end up coming out sickly yellow, requiring hours of manual adjusting. Not this little fighter though! Bright and beautiful right out of the box! Color pureists will notice things can get a bit washed out, but it's certainly preferable to the yellow tint of other machines. -The price is the best I've seen for the quality of machine you're getting. This thing is durable, sturdy and built for a few specific things it excels at. It's definitely given my productivity a boost and is well worth the investment. -There was pretty minimal bloatware on the machine, which was great. -Office 360 for a year is a HUGE plus. Also be sure to upgrade the machine to full Windows 10 (from S), the process is free, fast and jarringly painless. Cons: -Even 64 GBs is not a a huge amount of space. This is definitely more of a document and cloud oriented device. If you're hoping to put your entire music library on this thing you're going to need to expand the storage. If storage isn't an issue, than this is probably the book for you! -Similarly the 4 GBs of RAM can make this little engine chug sometimes. Don't expect it to be happy with running 20 chrome tabs at once,n or for it to instantly load pages the moment you click them. It's certainly fast enough, but as someone who's coming from a 16 GB machine the little differences can be noticeable. -The touch pad is ... OK. It's not terrible, but (much like all touch pads these days) it loses tracking now and then and lacks any real buttons for the left and right. I never much enjoyed touch pads to begin with so maybe I'm biased. Closing thoughts: If you like what you've read, read more reviews and honestly take the dive. If you're looking for a durable portable typer, that can do a little bit of everything this is your machine! More closing thoughts: A story for you, about ASUS laptops... In winter I got an ROG Strix II, a very powerful and very pricey machine. It was maddening getting the thing to work properly. Getting photoshop to play nice with the dual graphics. Getting the screen to not look yellow. Getting the damn speakers to not crank the bass. Many of these issues are still unresolved and frankly though I love the hardware I'm more than likely going to have to start from square one with that thing. I was all emotionally prepared to go through the same process with this little trail-blazer. I was ready to troubleshoot and troubleshoot and finally get something that mostly did what I needed. To my absolute delight, this machine seems to be the last bastion of PCs that do everything right, everything the way they're supposed to, right out of the box. I haven't had to troubleshoot a single thing about this beautiful laptop and honestly couldn't be happier. If you're looking for something portable, something durable, something to up your productivity and most of all something easy to work with, this is the laptop for you."}, {"name": "L", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2020", "title": "NIGHTMARE", "review_text": "What a nightmare.

First off, it is light, though not too small in size. The display, in my opinion, is excellent; and I'm also very happy with the size and feel of the keyboard. The mouse pad is not perfect (an occasional stutter in following my finger movement) but works fine 99% of the time). I immediately added a 256mb mini-SD card so it now has plenty of storage and I also did the upgrade to Win 10 Home (Pro was not an option, but also not required for my use). It was very easy to setup so most new apps download and run from the added SD (now drive D) storage, so after downloading my main program requirements, including the Fire Fox browser and Thunderbird mail client, and several others, I still have nearly 38GB of the 64GB internal memory remaining.

And love my 17in Omen as I do, I'm damned if that thing is going to travel with me anywhere I need to get some kind of work done when on vacation. Most of my work is cloud based, so I don't need a whole mess of hardware to run what I do. I like Chromebooks, but I did miss the Microsoft ecosystem when I used them, I found. This little thing looks to be just the niche I needed. It's dead small; I carry it around with my iPad Pro for editing photos and videos, and together they almost vanish in a bag. The battery life is pretty spectacular for the work I do on the regular. I did try, just for fun, putting some Photoshop and Lightroom projects on it, just to see how it handled them; eh - better than I thought, but definitely wouldn't recommend. Maybe in a pinch, but I wouldn't lean too heavily on it. The track pad is nothing special. I did eventually concede and buy a wireless mouse to use with it whilst on vacation, but that's probably down to my impatience on certain things. It was definitely better than some trackpads I've used, but nothing like my old Lenovo...(moment of silence for Thinky) All in all, though, I would recommend this to anyone for whom a Chromebook is a viable solution, but doesn't always go where constant connectivity is possible, so local word processing is a must. BTW, I can't really speak to how the Vivobook runs and works in S mode, like it comes out of the gate. I needed some applications that the store doesn't supply, so I switched out of it almost immediately. But I don't doubt it would work just fine, if not even faster. But I never grew fond of Internet Explorer, or the newer browser, so S mode had to go. Even so, 5/5, would highly recommend - just know what you need it for, and if it can meet those requirements.

Sometimes it works fine, but intermittently (enough to be annoying at every usage), it stops responding, then starts up again a second later.  I've read many discussion boards and it seems this is a known issue with ASUS touchpads.  All Windows updates are being automatically installed and it says it's up to date.  I tried uninstalling/reinstalling drivers (including the ASUS Smart Gestures app),  changing the Windows settings for the touchpad by setting it to maximum sensitivity but the problem persists.

I can run Dwarf Fortress and Stardew Valley without an issue (at the same time, even). I had some trouble with Wi-Fi drivers installing properly using Manjaro/Arch and gave up before going too far down the rabbit hole. Mint works perfectly using the Xfce edition, and I\u2019ve got i3 windows manager installed next to that and it\u2019s flawless. Drivers seem to work out of the box (with the correct distro at least). Battery life is so good - I\u2019ve never gotten past 50% before my nightly charge. As a point of pride I didn\u2019t even let it boot to Windows before ripping it out and putting Linux on, so I can\u2019t speak to that, but you definitely get a great bang for your buck running dainty Linux vs resource gobbling Windows. Hard drive is big enough that I didn\u2019t feel the need to get a microsd, though there is a port for one. I still have 33 GiB free after the OS and all of my tools. No fans to make noise, no moving parts really which is nice if you like it quiet and clean. Despite this the bottom gets only pleasantly warm but nowhere near hot or uncomfortable with a heavy load. It\u2019s very light at about two pounds, and the size is big enough to not feel cramped while still fitting in practically any bag. There\u2019s plenty of ports despite the small size, and the the inclusion of HDMI is surprising but welcome. The keyboard feels good. The touchpad is fine (though with i3 or similar windows manager I don\u2019t need to use it much). I even got the webcam  and mic to work with out of the box drivers. The screen is very glossy, but the range of brightness is good and so far I haven\u2019t been too bothered by reflections. Everything is plastic to keep it lightweight. It feels well built, not flimsy. I wouldn\u2019t trust it to hold up to rough handling, but I\u2019m not worried about it jostling about in my book bag.

You will get distortion looking straight on. The monitor was poorly calibrated with WAY too much gamma, luckily adjusting this with Windows is trivial, I will get back to 'S Mode' later on. You will not be able to use this monitor for watching movies with a lot of dark scenes. If you are looking at the screen dead on the outer regions of black will be distorted to LIGHT grey. The keyboard is decent, the 10-key is a bit difficult with the keys not being the right size on the side. The button press is tactile and usable and the feel is fine enough for typing blind, which you shouldn't have to do since the keyboard is back-lit. The touch pad is okay, it's actually a bit too sensitive, the lower corners can be used as buttons but I would greatly prefer physical buttons like on the current Lenovo brand laptops. The touch pad has a fingerprint reader in the top right corner which interferes with the operation of the touch pad but at least the fingerprint reader is fast! The speakers are complete garbage, they have no semblance to actual sounds and it sounds like you are listening to a cellphone speaker through a wooden door. They are completely unusable for anything at all, do not buy this laptop if you enjoy playing anything on your speakers. The webcam is usable, but it's nothing to write home about, capping out at 720p/30fps it will feel like a power-point presentation more than a video feed on any video chat. The sound is about the same as phone quality. If you do video chats frequently, find another laptop. Back to windows and 'S Mode'. Windows is pre-installed, it had some of the latest updates already so it was recently installed. It doesn't have much bloatware, but having Skype installed is too much already. The \"type\" of Windows that is installed is called 'S Mode' which is basically a locked down completely restrictive version of Windows. You can't even download Chrome from the web you have to get it from the Microsoft store - Chrome being the first app I install on any Windows computer -. I removed 'S Mode' almost immediately. The laptop has 4Gb of non-removable memory and 4Gb of replaceable memory which is nice even though it's only single channel. The laptop is made from a plastic frame which I actually don't mind, it makes the laptop reasonably light, but it gives it a cheap experience. Opening the lid for example requires two hands or a technique, both of which is actually mildly inconvenient. Summary: The good: Decent keyboard and touch pad, fast loading web pages If you like a want a PC for viewing Netflix/media at home with no headphones, look somewhere else. If you want a PC for viewing Wikipedia/news then this will be decent but there are cheaper laptops that can do that better. If you have a fancy IPS monitor, you will hate this laptop. If you are even thinking about gaming, the answer is no. Seeing as this laptop has such limited uses with the horrible screen and speakers, I cannot give this laptop a better review that 3 stars. It's only purpose is to view webpages and basic coffee-shop work."}, {"name": "Juan Mendez", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2019", "title": "perfect for college students", "review_text": "looking for a great affordable laptop that can be used for school and personal use?

My criteria were: lightweight, 8gb RAM, 64gb+ SSD, 1080p, with a full-sized HDMI port (no mini), Windows OS. I wanted it mostly for web browsing, word processing, and some fairly light gaming (modded Minecraft, Java version). After about a month, I am so far satisfied with this computer for all of those tasks. In fact, it surpassed my expectations in regards to gaming. I expected that it would be incapable of running more than a couple of mods, but so far it's taken everything I've thrown at it. I have not overclocked the processor (intentionally, anyway - perhaps windows does it automatically now?), and as such am operating at the stock 2.3Ghz (I think). I was slightly worried about purchasing this due to the reviews that commented about the screen quality/viewing angles. However, I am happy to report that I have not had any issues with screen visibility or warped edges. Perhaps I am simply plebian in my tastes, but it looks fine to me. It came with Windows 10 S, which I certainly did not want, but it was perfectly easy to disable. The backlit keyboard is honestly a lifesaver. I hadn't specifically sought out this feature, but it's fantastic. It comes with various brightnesses instead of a toggle, which frankly is unnecessary because the lowest setting is plenty bright. However, as mentioned in other reviews, it does cause a significant hit to battery life (or so it seems). The battery life is my only quibble, but admittedly, I believe that's mostly due to my usage rather than the machine itself. I have multiple Chrome tabs running at all times, as well as Visual Studio Code, and frequently Minecraft as well. At this level of usage, the battery lasts on average 2-3 hours. I haven't timed it though, so that is simply an estimate on my part. All in all, I am much happier with this $300 laptop than I was with my old laptop, which 8 years ago was twice the price. No doubt you can find better performance with a higher budget, but if you are tight on money, I highly recommend this device."}, {"name": "joe", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2019", "title": "good laptop", "review_text": "very good laptop , very stylish and lightweight"}, {"name": "Nitin", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2019", "title": "Advertised USB-C connectivity just for namesake", "review_text": "Screen is not the best but still workable and understandable at this price point.

I didn't need the best processor as all my work is done online, but do open multiple taps and email all day long. I added 8 gb RAM and 500 gb SSD, which should be plenty for me, so overall $80 in upgrades that add to the cost of the laptop. Still cheaper than a stronger processor laptop that I'd pay $100+ more for and still end up upgrading memory and storage. Boot time is lightning fast and so far everything responds as it should during work. Upgrading was super easy. There is a space for an extra hard drive, but no connector or caddy so those will have to be purchased separately, adding on another $20 to the cost. If you have a hard time finding the right connector and caddy to fit, I purchased the https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PDZ4DGF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1, which ended up fitting fine but the screws are loose holding the drive to the caddy and it is only friction holding it in place in the empty hard drive slot. It is a good tight fit so it is fine for my use, which is mostly work at home, very rarely taking my laptop out of the home to work away. Overall I spent around $450 for a decent processor and plenty of memory and storage. I'm not sure how the screen would do in a real world setting. It is fine at home where I can keep it angled correctly on my desk, the keyboard has a good feel to it, not cramped and I'm hitting the right keys so the layout is what I'm used to on my Logitech home keyboard. Mouse pad so far is responsive, which can be a problem in most of my previous laptops. I like the fingerprint reader, which makes starting up that much quicker. Easy to switch out of S-mode. I used last night off the charger for the first time and I forgot to check the time on the battery, but it was not impressive. The laptop itself is nice and lightweight so carrying it my laptop bag shouldn't be cumbersome. Overall I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this laptop with the upgrades noted above. Would not recommend unless you are planning on upgrading. It worked fine before the SSD upgrade (upgraded memory right out of the box), but once you start saving anything you'll quickly run out of room leaving no room for temporary files on your primary drive. At the very least you'll need to add a 250 GB drive if you want to store anything on your hard drive."}, {"name": "Seasalem", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2020", "title": "Great Value For What I Wanted", "review_text": "I've had the ASUS Vidbook with Intel core i3 (many of these reviews seem to have AMD chips as well) for only a week now but I'm very impressed. What I like first. Pro's: 1.  I like the screen.  I've seen reviews that say the screen is basically trash.  Well the model I have it's great for what I want.  I've owned anywhere from 8 to 10 laptops in my life from Dell to Sony and I like the screen on the ASUS.  Mainly due to the fact it's not overly saturated bright.  Its more of a soft natural light almost like reading a piece of paper vs bright blues that give headaches and eyestrain. 2.  I really like the keyboard so far (not sure how it will hold up with time) Key strokes are easy and the back lighting is just right. 3.  It's fast for what I'm doing.  Load up speed is great, there isn't much if any bloat ware to deal with which i've found on Dell and other computers.  I'm mainly surfing the net, streaming videos, creating power point presentations etc... 4.  One of the main things I like about this computer is that it is light weight especially at the price, your getting a relatively light weight computer with a fairly standard size keyboard and screen without paying Apple prices. Cons: 1.  It's hard to think of some con's but one is that the computer comes with Microsoft 10S, which is easy to turn off to 10 Home, using instructions to do so. 2.

It is a problem with Windows 10, and affects multiple users: I got stuck on a blue screen during the initial Windows 10-S configuration. To get around this, do not establish an Internet connection while configuring Windows 10-S. Skip that step. Select \"I do not have an Internet connection.\" It will save you a massive headache. Set up your Internet connection after Windows has finished setting up. If you're stuck on that screen, and cannot go back to the Internet configuration step, power down your router and restart the laptop (hold the power button for 5 seconds, wait 10 seconds, power on the laptop). It will restart the Windows 10-S configuration from the beginning, and with the router off, you can select \"I do not have an Internet connection\" at that step. Windows 10-S is also an awful proprietary mess. It does not let you download or install programs I require for some reason, rendering the whole OS absolutely worthless. It's the obnoxious closed ecosystem Apple utilizes, but on hardware sorely lacking the Apple engineering that makes such an ecosystem beneficial. Fortunately the laptop let me install a proper version of Windows for free through the Microsoft store, so only minor point deductions for just being a hassle, and not requiring an additional purchase. The screen is about what you expect from a cheaper laptop. Nothing fancy. Certainly not something for optimum media or gaming experience. Picks up lots of glare, fades significantly when viewed at even slight angles, the usual issues. Bonus points, though, for outputting at native 1080p resolution, a major selling point for me getting this laptop. The fan in it is LOUD. Whenever it's writing data, installing a program, or on resource-intensive websites, that fan goes at full speed, and it goes for a few minutes after these tasks have completed. Overall, as far as medium-range laptops go, it's decent. Gets the job done. Just might be a headache to configure and optimize right out of the box. But if you know what you're doing, and intend to use this laptop for mostly work-related activity or web browsing on the go, it's perfectly fine.

I don't consider myself much of a gamer, but I do play some fairly light games and only 1 game that is maybe a bit more consuming. I can play Smite (an online game) quite fine, without much lagg (it laggs for about 1 minute if I'm streaming while playing music on youtube, but then it stops lagging). The graphics definitely look a little granulated on the corners of some of the game characters, but it still looks fairly good. The screen itself also has a sort of faded look to it. Like the lighting is a little strange or maybe the screen is cheap. It has that \"dusty\" look to it, sort of like those old computers we had to use in elementary school.

The 512 GB SSD feels fast and speedy. The 16Gb of fast ram is nice. The i7 processor is a beast, with speed (and noisy fan) bursts when needed. This is a fast, well-optioned machine inside. The screen is nice and the 14 inch size is a nice compromise vs the larger 15.6 and 13 inch sizes. The chicklet keyboard is reasonable, and it is backlit which is a very nice touch. The fingerprint detector has been working reliably for me, but that isn't a feature that I care a lot about. I'm fine with logging into my computer with a PIN code or webcam. The Acer Spin 3 Convertible Laptop, 14\" Full HD IPS Touch, 8th Gen Intel Core i7-8565U, 16GB DDR4, 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD, Backlit KB, Fingerprint Reader, SP314-53N-77AJ has a rechargeable active stylus, which is not - in my opinion - up to the task of doing artwork on a computer. It IS fine for note-taking and rough drawing, but for serious art-work I think it needs to be better. Still, it is definitely a nice touch. So what is my big beef with the Acer Spin 3? THE CONNECTIVITY OPTIONS ARE SERIOUSLY LACKING!. There is NO USB-C. If you aren't familiar with USB-C (I wasn't until recently) it is the connector of all connectors. A SINGLE USB-C can be used to add almost dozens of different devices to your computer. A $50 hub can be plugged into a USB-C port and it can support external hard drives, internet ports, HDMI output, headphone jacks, card readers and even charge other devices. A single small USB-C port makes your laptop able to connect to so many more devices. Without one, you limited in so many ways . The Acer Spin 3 comes with only a COUPLE of standard USB ports and a card reader, a headphone jack and an HDMI output. I am constantly trying to plug devices into my laptops and needing more ports, and the Acer Spin 3 just doesn't have many. Another interesting (good) thing about the Acer Spin 3 is that the wall wart or transformer for this computer is very small compared to most of my laptops. It is only 2.4 amps and about 45 watts, which isn't very much really. You could run this off of a good sized powerbank if you had to for a bit. I was torn on how to rank this on stars. On one hand, I am very disappointed in the limitations that the Acer 3 has on connectivity. On the other hand, it is a speedy little devil that is pretty competent at computing. If you are using this in a work environment where you need to do spreadsheets, e-mail, word processing and even photoshop type editing, it is a pretty nice machine with very respectable specs, speed and parts list. If you are looking for something super creative, where you can plug in several things like external hard drives, or drawing pads, or you want an awesome screen - you are going to be frustrated by the lack of USB-C. I'm going with four stars. It is a very good computer. But if it had even just one USB-C port, it would have been a great computer. I hope you find this review helpful. I feel like that reviews are super important on Amazon and they really help me determine if a product is worth buying or not - so I try to return the favor and leave a review that will honestly tell you whether a product is good or not. We all use products differently, so I also try to make it clear what was important to me, and hopefully that makes it easy for you to tell if you will like it too. I also think it is important for Amazon shoppers to stick together and let each other know if a product is garbage. I WILL let you know if a product isn't good, so you can avoid the hassles of returning a product or a product you lose money on. PLEASE go to my profile page and reach out to me if you have any questions. I enjoy writing reviews and try to respond to any questions about a product ASAP.

As a photographer and videographer, my work demands a lot of RAM and processing power, and that is where this PC excels. I can have Photoshop and Lightroom open at once, working back and forth between both programs, and the computer keeps up beautifully. The included rechargeable pen works with the full Adobe suite without any setup required \u2014 and it\u2019s even pressure-sensitive! Extremely handy and natural feeling. The Spin 3 IS powerful enough to edit big projects in Premiere Pro, but after a certain point, some lag becomes inevitable. Still, I am surprised it handles large files as well as it does. I usually work with extremely large 4K videos formatted in ProRes CODEC, and the Spin handles them without any programs crashing. The downside of this PC, however, is its integrated graphics card. While cheaper and more energy-efficient, an integrated GPU is a great deal slower than a dedicated GPU when it comes to video editing, gaming, and other graphics-intensive tasks. So despite its fantastic processor and RAM, the Spin is just short of being the workstation it could be. The fan also blasts much louder than any other laptop I\u2019ve used, even with just a browser and a few tabs open, and it gets pretty hot. However, despite its disadvantages, the Spin 3 remains powerful enough to work on the go, and if necessary, at least get a start on projects that can be finished on more powerful computers later. It features a beautiful touchscreen display, a good trackpad, an SD card reader, and a keyboard that feels pretty similar to older MacBooks. I would summarize it as a mid-level workstation \u2014 not quite as powerful as it could be, but more than adequate for dozens of professional tasks. I highly recommend it! There is not much to complain about."}, {"name": "King of Reviews", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2019", "title": "Great Price to Performance!", "review_text": "Despite my first dismal experience with amazon\u2019s shipping with the product arriving late and looking like it had been dropped kicked, my initial experience with the laptop. Speed: This boy is equipped with one of the fastest ssd\u2019s available at a respectable size, 16gb of ram (a must in todays era), and a 4 core 8 thread processor. This cpu tends to score a 4787 on single threaded loads and a 13130 on multithreaded loads accourding to geekbench. \"Geekbench 4 scores are calibrated against a baseline score of 4000 (which is the score of an Intel Core i7-6600U). Higher scores are better, with double the score indicating double the performance.\" My particular machine scored a 5259 on the single threaded test and a 15849 on the multithreaded. It should also be considered that i had firefox running at the time of my tests which was utilizing around 5% of my cpu. The screen: the screen is beautiful and has amazing viewing angles as most ips panels, though when compared to my Pixio PX275H, which has a high color gambit, the colors did appear to be slightly more muted. The hinges are great when comparing it to a family members asus notebook that was bought earlier this year. Unlike the asus it doesnt lock up in odd orientations. The touch screen is responsive and the pen is adequate for light photoshop work. The pen does lack the capability for the finer details and the buttons on it lack any meaningful programability. The brightness is average. Not the brightest screen ive seen but certainly not the dullest. I used mine at about 40% in a well lit room and 60-70% in a sunlit room. Battery life: at a balanced setting and an average use case this will last about 6 hours. This time can be increased if you use the optimal battery saving options and set the gpu to prioritize battery life when the system is unplugged. The keyboard and touchpad: this keyboard feels amazing! Its nice and solid and the keys are firm and dont wiggle. The backlight is nice and crisp\u2014but not over bearing\u2014and can be turned off. The touch pad is large and responsive and handles all the gestures excellently. The finger scanner is just as fast as touch id on my iphone 6s which is nice. The io: only 2 usbs? Not even a type c? Why acer! It would be more acceptable if both usbs were 3.1 but one of the usbs is a 2.0 which has way slower speeds. (When compared to its 10gbps 3.1 brethren) That port is basically only useful for a mouse dongle. It does have a sd card reader which is nice, but it juts out too far in my opinion. It could have easily been designed to fit more snugly into the system upon viewing the interior of the system. The full size hdmi is a plus and the powerbrick for the laptop is super small. The power connector also swivels for optimal placement. Gaming: this is not a gaming machine. This machine shines brightest in its productivity workloads. The integrated graphics should be able to run most competitive games like rocket league, csgo, fortnite, and overwatch at low to medium settings. It can run minecraft with optifine at around 50fps on average with a beefy texture pack. Upgradability: the laptop is equipped with 8gb of ram soldered to the board and an 8gb stick of ddr4 ram. Acer has confirmed that this motherboard can utilize 24gb if you were to swap that 8gb stick for a 16gb. The NVME drive is relatively easy to access and swap out for a 1tb if you so wish. Theoretically you could also try adding a 2.5in drive as there is an empty bay for it. If you were to do that you would need to acquire a ribbon cable connector. I have tried one from an SP315 model with no success, but that may be due to a defective wire. I currently have ordered a cable from an SP314 model to see if i have any luck with that. I will update if im successful. I got my system on prime day for $100 off, but even at its full $800 price tag this system is tempting. You wont find all these features on another laptop at this price point. The closest thing i could find was an ultrathin at the same price by acer, but it had only 8gb of ram and no touchscreen and pen support. I would recommend this pc for your average user.

A metal body would be nice (this one shows smudges and recently got a scratch although I'm not sure how since the lid was shut and the scratch was by the touchpad). I have yet to need it for anything particularly resource intensive but no issues using it for Word, PDFs, Internet, and the like. It's also not all that common that I hear it's fans go into overdrive and make a ruckus. I try to use a lap desk whenever I'm not at a desk but even when I don't, it hasn't gotten as hot as the first day when it was too hot to leave on my lap. In short, if my previous cons list had led me to only give 4 stars, I would bump it up to a 5 now, but it was a five-star purchase from the start. :) (Summary at the bottom) PROS: -This is a pretty reasonable deal when you compare to the cost of getting the same specs on other laptops. I was mainly looking at Dell and Lenovo and the best I found from them was Lenovo's 2019 Flex 6 14\". Biggest difference between the specs that mattered to me was the Lenovo only cost $750 but also only had an i5 processor. The specs that mattered to me were processor, hard drive capacity, SSD, screen resolution, size, weight, RAM, and that it was a 2-in-1. -I haven't used much more than Chrome, Adobe PDF reader and Excel yet so I haven't tried to max out computer resources but I can verify that there's no lag with normal use. Restart takes 20 seconds from hitting restart to being logged in with the fingerprint scanner. -3rd party reviews from sites like PCMag of the 2018 model complained about the keys not depressing far enough to be comfortable typing a lot. While a slightly longer keystroke would feel more satisfactory to me, it's not so shallow that I would avoid it for large quantities of writing. -FHD seems like a good resolution on a 14\" screen. HD is not considered high res these days but I doubt the improvement of a 4K screen would be worth the cost, if you could even notice a significant difference between the two screens. -My last laptop had a 15.6\" screen so it was a bit of a risk cutting down on screen space but 14\" doesn't feel cramped the way 11\" or even 13\" does. It doesn't feel small unless it's sitting right next to my old laptop. The weight savings of having a smaller laptop are definitely worth it! -It's got a plastic body but it doesn't feel flimsy or cheaply built for the most part. The few minor exceptions are in my Cons list. -Fingerprint scanner was a bonus for me. It works very nicely -Stylus is handy in tablet mode. I didn't buy the laptop for the stylus so I can't speak to it's quality but I was able to make some fun art messing around in Inkscape with it. I don't know how it would work for professional-level art since the limiting factor for me is that I'm still pretty new to Inkscape. CONS: -Doesn't have the 12-hour battery life they advertise but then again, what laptop ever has the full capacity advertised? I would guess it's actually around 6-8 hours, which is still pretty reasonable. Tip: look up Acer's recommendations for battery charging before you set it up. I know it's important to go through a few full charge cycles when you first get it to extend the battery life but I forget the details of their recommendation. -It does get hot and use the fans at full speed pretty easily. The vents are on the bottom of the laptop and along the hinged edge whereas my last laptop had them on the left edge so with this one, I can almost guarantee you'll want to set it on a lap desk or large book rather than directly on your lap if you're going to be using it for a longer sitting. I'll probably eventually get a lap desk with cooling fans built in. That said, there's only been a couple times the fans have gotten noisy when it wasn't on my lap and when I moved it off my lap after it got too hot to be comfortable, it cooled down very quickly. -The charging plug is surprising small - probably to help keep the laptop thin. I don't mind that but it still has a lot of wobble to it when it's plugged in so my preference is to unplug it again once the battery is fully charged. -Indoors with a room well-lit by ambient daylight, having the brightness at about 65% is comfortable for me. This doesn't leave a lot of buffer to amp it up outside in the sun but I'm not surprised that's not what laptops are designed for. -Same with the volume - max volume was comfortable if not a bit quiet outdoors but if I wanted to broadcast music outside, I'd use a portable speaker anyways. In the home, I haven't felt the need to max out the volume though. -There's a couple rubber feet and you can see some of the places the screen clips into the frame, which gives it a bit cheaper aesthetic but nothing major. I'll probably get used to it. -Bezel along the top and sides is reasonable but it's pretty thick along the bottom - probably 3/4\" of visible case, which makes sense because of the hinges, but then another 1\"+ of glossy black before the screen actually starts. The only thing in that space, at least externally, is the Acer logo. The result is it makes the task bar look really far up. -Probably the thing I dislike the most is that the casing used for the 360 hinges has a see-your-reflection-in-it type of shiny surface. Maybe it's just personal taste but it makes them look like cheap plastic. It's also annoying when I'm in a room with low lighting and they catch the glare from a lamp behind me. SUMMARY: It has some quirks I don't care for but I bought it mainly for the processing power and portability. More money would probably fix the quirks but thanks to other reviews, I wasn't surprised by any of them."}, {"name": "Sardorbek Mamadjanov", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2019", "title": "Generally a good laptop.", "review_text": "Generally the laptop is good.

When its on and running it is great. Very useful and way better than any laptop or tablet that i have ever had. BUT, the issue is that if I bump the power button (even for just a monent), if I leave it on with the screen open for to long, or if I close the screen while it is on, it will completely freeze it EVERY SINGLE TIME! As in nothing works, black screen, keyboard backlit, and a blinking orange light on the side. I have to then use a paper clip and press the battery pull/reset button in order to get it to re-start. I always assumed this would get fixed by one of the frequent updates, but I was very wrong. I finally contacted ACER. First through the chat option. This was very generic and was told 2 steps. One was to reset factory bios (?) settings on start up and of course the next was to FULLY WIPE and system restore. So lose all of my files on the computer. Well the bios reset did nothing. Then I called and a rather rude support lady told me I was not properly shutting off my computer. And that you should never close the screen without properly shutting it all the way down. And that I should not be pressing the battery pull button often, like I enjoy my brand new 800 dollar computer freezing all the time.  She had me do a operating system restore on it, in which it then froze a few times in the middle of. Thats never happened before this! She was in a big hurry to get off the phone so refused to stick around till it finished up. Well this didnt fix anything either.  SO I called back again and finally got a guy that actually knew something about computers. We worked together and found what he says is the issue. BUT, it needs to be shipped to them, AT MY COST, and I need to buy something to back up all my files to cause they say my computer will be completely wiped when it comes back.  I do like this computer, but I dont think i will be buying another acer product any time soon!   UPDATE- I still haven't had time to back my files up and send in my computer BUT today a different one showed up in the mail from the Acer repair facility! It was an older model.skin 3with the I3 processor. I wasn't sure if this was supposed to be some kinda a replacement of what. Called the dreaded customer support and was told that is MY computer and that I must have sent it in to them. I insisted it was NOT mine cause I had BOTH the computers now in front of me. She put me on hold 2 times and after each time she would tell me again that I had sent that computer to them. Finally I told her \"fine, I will just keep this computer as well if that's what she wants\".

I honestly should have just kept this computer they sent me on accident cause they had ZERO idea that I even had it!

In the past I've resorted to using one computer for professional work and one for personal but cheap computers are horrid things. I've bought a couple Acers in the past - chromebooks - basically to keep family out of my \"real\" computers. Frankly, that was what I was expecting again - another Acer that would be used for small family chats and other miscellaneous. I was pleasantly surprised to encounter a light weight, very versatile and downright peppy performance on this new model. First the good - out of the box this can be turned on and set-up. Cortana literally talks you through the process and it takes just a few minutes. Add a couple more for syncing with other accounts and you are done. The built in stylus is responsive and sensitive as is the touch screen capacity. The fingerprint security is terrific - works very well.

I mean it is 4-6 hours with a basic task like running Microsoft Word and Chrome and checking your e-mails etc. 4- There are several times that touch pad freezes and then it works again. This happened to me after using it for 3 weeks. What I mean by freezing is that, it won't fully sense your finger while you are using it and it will partially move to the point that you want to drag the pointer. 5-  Once the battery is low and then you plug in the charger, the laptop won't work with its full CPU. It will work slower than usual until the battery is up to %30. It gets so slow and you can even see it while typing. The letters come later to the screen after you type. 6- If you want to use it on tablet mod and want to use it in bed or just in a meeting, the laptop gets hot since the fans are located under the laptop. AndIt is so heavy, you will need good muscles to hold it. I bought that laptop because of the great price for its specs. I would buy Macbook or Dell because I know that they will last longer. Especially Macbook. Now I regret it because probably this laptop will be broken in couple of months, and I would need to spend money on new Mac.  I wish I could get full refund for this laptop but I missed the return window."}, {"name": "Amazon Customer", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2019", "title": "GREAT COMPUTER, SUPER FAST, THE GRAPHIC IS AMAZING AND YOU CAN LITERALLY DO ANYTHING.", "review_text": "I LOOOOOVE this computer.

So you mostly have to figure it out by yourself unless you want to call the costumer service number (flyer included in the box) but I like figuring out things by myself mostly.

Barbosa", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2019", "title": "Sturdy and reliable.", "review_text": "I have been using this laptop for a month. First, the laptop arrived in excellent conditions. No scratches, no missing parts. It boots up very quickly, indeed. After turning it on for the first time, it required me to provide few information and, after about five minutes it was fully configured. Then, I updated the base language to my native language, which took another twenty minutes or so. After that, I have been using it without problems, except a few snags. I will explain it below. 1- Screen and touchscreen \u2013The screen is bright, clear, swiftly responsive upon touch and accurate. The rim around the screen is very thin, making it looks like the screen occupies the whole facing plate. Tablet mode switch window automatically pops-up when the screen is flipped over. The screen plate hinge built is sturdy. It seems to me it will be able to do the job flipping over and over for a long time. Pen is also accurate (Added on 11/20/2019 - I mean, fairly accurate. A small four points star reflects the contact point of the pen when it touches the screen exactly underneath. However, if you lift up the pen tip from the screen, just a few millimeters, and moves the pen around without contact, you will notice that the star indicating the pen tip position underneath falls behind and takes a while to update the exact position.) 2 - Core i7 CPU, 16 Gb RAM, 512 Gb SSD set - Very nice. CPU-Z version 1.89.1x64 rates the CPU as 1605.1 for multi thread and 358.8 for single thread. (multithread ratio 4.47), running Norton antivirus, MS OneDrive and MS Defender in background. Number of USB ports (2.0 and 3.1, type A one of each) is Ok for me. There is one HDMI 1.4b port and one SD card reader port. Double antenna ac WiFi, Bluetooth. 3 - Battery life - Using factory settings, it will certainly last between 4 h and 6 h. Adjusting battery settings to economy mode, Intel Graphics Control Panel to maximum battery autonomy, dimming screen brightness to minimum, turning off both Bluetooth and location (GPS) facility, and keeping the keyboard backlight on, battery will probably last between 10 h and 12 h (Battery gauge indicates remaining charge for 10 h at 94 %). When using it continuously for text writing and internet surfing, it will probably last up to 8 h. Turning keyboard backlight off will make it last a little longer, perhaps. 4 - Keyboard \u2013 This is the reason I gave it 4 stars (and stated almost flawlessly, above). I would have given 4.5 if it would be possible. The keyboard is backlit, which is very good. It dims off automatically a few seconds after the last hit, and turns light on as one types. It can also be permanently turned off, if necessary. Fingerprint sensor works Ok and activates the laptop swiftly. I had to relearn the positions of arrows, page up/down. In addition, home/end functions are only accessible via pressing simultaneously Fn & pgup/pgdn, which has been tricky since I started using it. The point is that the experience offered by Spin 3 keyboard typing makes me feel like the keys are not exactly loose, but not so tight either. Sometimes, it duplicates the character when I press the key once, like 'nn', 'aa', 'rr', 'ee', and 'oo'. As I type quickly, now and then I must come back, erase the character typed in double, and retype the word again (as I am doing it right now). (Added on 11/17/2019 - In my opinion, the problem escalates here when I type a password to enter an account. This double typing glitch may cause unwillingly [as it really does few times] password errors. In a plausible scenario where you are about to register an website account and enter the password for the first time, if a mistyping happens then, you will have to rescue your password ahead, at least.) I think this a chronic problem. This is my second ACER laptop. The first one, Aspire V5 touchscreen core i5, I bought it five years ago is overall working fine, by the way (Refer to a review I have made of Acer Aspire V5). The issue is that key pressing results in double tying in Aspire V5 as it does in Spin 3. However, Spin 3 typing experience has improved in relation to Aspire V5. Mouse-pad is Ok and fingerprint sensor works fine. Overall, I am glad about my acquisition, and I think this has been an excellent laptop for the price. Keyboard needs to improve.

It is fast and the touch screen is great.  The negatives:  battery life is about 6 hours and the fingerprint reader has not worked for me since day 3. I really do like this Acer Spin 3 2-in-1 laptop.  The combination of the 8th generation i7 processor, 16gb of ram and the 512 Solid State Drive make this machine very fast and I have yet to bog it down.  It is a lot faster than my desktop computer, which is about 2 years old and has 12 gb of ram and a standard 1tb hard drive.  The integrated graphics card is basic and would not be useful for a person that does a lot of video editing or hardcore gaming, neither of which I do.  The backlit keyboard works well. The 14 inch screen is exactly what I was looking for because a 15.6 would be to big for me to carry around daily and a 13.3 seemed a touch small.  I have watched many videos on the 1080p HD screen and it looks great, but then again it is only 14 inches so even 720p or possibly 480p would look good on this size.  The touch screen works great, I have had zero issues with it. The laptop has all of the connections I require, but it would have been nice if it had a USB-C.  When I purchased the laptop I knew it did not have a USB-C, so I fine with that.  The other outstanding specs in this machine were more important to me. Regarding battery life, so far the best I have really done is about 6 hours or half of which the manufacture claimed.  Unfortunately, half the battery life is par for the course when it comes to laptops.  Also the thumb print reader only worked for a few days even though I cleaned it.  Luckily I have been able to login with my PIN, but one day I did have an issue that said my PIN was not valid.  A restart of the computer appeared to fix that issue. All-in-all it is a nice laptop that performs well.  I want to rate it 5 stars, but due to the thumb print reader and battery life I am giving it 4 stars.  I would purchase this 2-in-1 again.

I am a college student who just wants a laptop that I can easily carry around so I can bring it around campus and study anywhere I want. Did it do that? Yes! I also want to be able to play most games smoothly and without lag. Did it do that? Yes! Here are some other things great about this laptop: It has 16 GB of ram which is more than enough. Trifold functions allow me to relax at my bed and watch YouTube. Despite the lightweight, its outer is very protective and not made of plastic. You can use your fingerprint as your password. The fan makes a quiet background noise that you wouldn't notice at all if you don't focus on it when it tries to cool off your laptop. The keyboard is very easy to type on. The keyboard lights up when you type on it(unnecessary to me but I guess that looks cool :) ) Long-lasting battery. The battery charges up fast. Here are some of the little flaws about it(doesn't bother me that much): You can't leave the laptop more than halfway open because it would close instead of staying open. No place to insert disk(I get it though, it's not big enough to have an opening for a disk). The battery is great but it certainly does not last 12 hours 99.99% of the time. You have to turn on the ultimate battery saver mode to be able to let the battery lasts 8-12 hours. I don't need it to last 12 hours but I'm just a bit disappointed that it does not meet the Amazon description that says it could last up to 12 hours. However, in most cases, it would approximately last 4-6 full hours and 6-8 hours if you take breaks in between the periods you use the laptop. The battery is good enough for most of us. And there you go. If you are a college student like me who just want to laptop to perform basic functions and study and occasionally relax by playing games and watching YouTube, this is the laptop for you. If you are a gamer or a business person, this would not be a bad option but it is not designed for you.

My demands aren\u2019t terribly heavy \u2014 no serious gaming or rendering, just light CAD and software development alongside the usual browsing and Internet usage \u2014 and this machine fits the bill nicely. I haven\u2019t used Windows machines much at all for many years, but I wanted to try Windows 10 and the 2-in-1 form factor, so non-touch laptops were out. Cheaper 2-in-1\u2019s are surely available, but the i7 CPU, good-sized SSD, and 16GB of RAM, along with good experiences I\u2019ve had with Acer machines in the past, led me to this machine. I\u2019ve found it really pleasant to use and have found myself picking it up often for casual use. With Windows 10, it switches effortlessly between laptop and tablet modes, handling both portrait and landscape mode automatically. I didn\u2019t know how well direct screen touch would work with Windows apps, since most of them were designed with a mouse in mind, but modern apps like Microsoft News work nicely with big fingers. I also appreciate the fact that the system didn\u2019t come with a lot of extra junk apps installed. Although I\u2019m not a gamer, I have fond memories of the Mechwarrior series of games, so I installed Mechwarrior Online on the Spin. It was playable, but a little sluggish; I think I\u2019d get frustrated with its responsiveness in a pitched battle. Older games seem to work pretty well, so if you want to revisit some classics from GOG.com, for example, the Spin will serve well. The only nits I\u2019d pick are the lack of a thumb relief notch to make opening the lid easier and the fact that the machine\u2019s a bit heavy for tablet-style browsing. The fingerprint reader requires more than one try pretty often, and of course, one could always use more battery life. But I\u2019m really pleased with this machine, and although my MacBook Pro is still my primary device, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend the Spin to anyone with similar needs\u2026 it\u2019s a great value."}, {"name": "Daniel", "rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2020", "title": "Make sure all functionality is there before configuring your computer", "review_text": "I bought this computer because  recently purchased smart phone was much smarter and with more memory than any computer I owned.  On the face of it, it is a good computer but I can't give it a high rating because there are problems.  On the computer I got the Bluetooth was was not functional. I didn't discover that until a week later.  I needed to used the Bluetooth. It could not discover any  Bluetooth audio devices. I tried a speaker  and a headphone. After some fiddling around I decided to call customer service.  I got a tech support person whose English skills were limited (he probably would have done alright with chat, but that was not available). I had to repeat myself a lot. After a while of what I assume was running diagnostics he confidently stated it was a hardware problem and I needed to mail it to Acer.  He  couldn't or wouldn't  tell me where on the planet where it would be mailed to.  He said the return label  and return instructions would come to me in an email.  At the time of this writing I'm still waiting.   The Bluetooth thing wouldn't be so important if the computer had better speakers. The speakers on my smart phone sound better. The other problem is the lack of a Caps Lock indicator, not a big problem unless you want to enter a password and the site doesn't let you see what you're typing.   I was optimistic at first because I had called tech support when I got my computer. I couldn't find the stylus which  was inside the computer and not packaged separately. I called the number given on a card that said something like, \"before you return this, call us.\"  I got an answer right away. I had lost that number before I called again which is probably why I got a second tier tech and a 10 min wait time.   Other than that, the display and the camera are crisp, and the keyboard has back lighting and a solid feel. The response time for loading a page is virtually instantaneous.

I do see the possibilities with a usb-c connection, but with 3.0 and hdmi only good as a cheap hub, those complaining are missing the point of the product. It was not a deal breaker for me. The only design features I am not sure how I feel about are: the location of the fingerprint scanner in the touch-pad and the huge gap for the bezel to screen. My ring size is 20 and my hands can span about 14 inches. (take a bunch of bananas and put on the keyboard and you have an analog. So for me most of the time my hands are blocking the taskbar for me, not so much with this one. I kind of like it. So the screen bezel is about .7 of an inch plus another .5 for the whole upper assembly. For me works out, for others, maybe not so much. The only other feature I am deducting a star for is no 2 usbs on the same side. 2.0 or 3.0. Easily fixed with a hub, but should not have to. Otherwise handles most of my tasks with ease. Wifi is great no mater the screen position, which is why some convertibles have issues. Not sure on the rest, but compared to others out there, not too shabby. This model reportedly can be upgraded memory, some of the acers cannot, they have onboard soldered memory. beware if you intend to do this. quick google search of the model number tells you."}, {"name": "Garland", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2020", "title": "Extremely Reliable and Great Value", "review_text": "This 2-in-1 is a great value for its price tag. It run's multiple programs at once without faulting. The back light for the keyboard is an added bonus, as it helps you see in the dark. Not that big of a deal breaker though. The touch screen is quite responsive and the included pen is quite convenient. It has a secure holder in the computer on the side, just like the pictures show, and it is not flimsily held. As I said, the touch screen is a wonderful edition and it is convenient to take notes and put on a presentation. One of the apps you can have is Your Phone and the laptop is quite responsive to it. The size of the laptop is right where it should be and at about 14\", it is portable for on the go people. I recommend a good case in order to keep it safe. The only gripe is the battery life, as if you are running multiple programs, it may run out faster than expected. In my experience, I ran Google Meets, Sheets, Docs, Your Phone, and had multiple webpages open, and it lasted for about a good 5 hours before battery ran low. It did run quite cool the entire time though. The fan is not loud at all.

First things first, the touch screen works great. Super responsive. Same with the stylus. The only thing I don\u2019t like about the stylus is...it\u2019s a little small. Someone with big hands might find it hard to work with. But other than that, it\u2019s good. The 14 inch screen is a good size. I don't feel like it needs to be any bigger or smaller, just right. The fingerprint reader works like a charm. Sometimes it will have trouble picking up your fingerprint, but with some slight readjustments it works fine. The mousepad is great and I\u2019ve encountered no problems with it thus far. I\u2019ve had this laptop for several months and these are my TWO BIGGEST GRIPES. One: the battery life. I bought this laptop for school and the biggest thing that stands out is the BATTERY LIFE. DO NOT LISTEN to what Acer or Amazon says. This laptop does NOT get 12 hours of battery life. If that is a big deal for you, then please look for another laptop. I would say it can get 6-8 hours of battery life, 8 if you\u2019re pretty lucky. Now please note I have never run a battery test on this laptop, this is just coming from my personal experience. IF you\u2019re buying this laptop for school, then I wouldn\u2019t worry about. I have never had to use this for more than a couple hours at a time, so, personally, I don\u2019t think the battery life is too bad. My SECOND gripe is...it feels cheap. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the specs for this laptop at this price range are insane (btw, please don\u2019t expect to do hardcore gaming on this, it will drain the battery, look elsewhere if you want a gaming laptop), but it just...feels cheap. It\u2019s made of this cheap-feeling plastic (excluding the screen of course), which makes it feel like it will get completely destroyed after one drop on hard concrete. Now, notice I said cheap-FEELING. I have no clue what this thing can with stand or what it\u2019s made of, I\u2019m just telling you that, in my opinion, it feels cheap. However other than these two complaints, everything feels great. It super quick and snappy and have encountered very little problems with it. It spins around and works just fine when putting it into tablet mode, (though I don\u2019t use this mode that often myself). Keyboard is good, love the backlighting. Not too loud, and I don\u2019t feel that it gets that hot, (but I haven\u2019t been doing intense stuff with it at the same time). Again, idk what suits you personally but for me, the ports are fine. All I find myself using is the USB, HDMI, headphone jack, and charging port (obviously). I don\u2019t feel that it takes that long to charge, maybe a couple hours. Before I wrap this up, one final (small) gripe I have to talk about is the speaker. I\u2019m not a tech-savvy person (as you probably noticed) so I couldn\u2019t tell you what exactly is wrong with the speaker. It just feels...mediocre. It\u2019s not the worst I\u2019ve ever heard but it\u2019s nowhere close to being the best. It\u2019s just...ok. Certainly not a deal breaker for this laptop though. In conclusion, this is an AMAZING laptop for its price with a few issues (battery life, plastic, speaker), but honestly, every laptop has its problems. With the Acer Spin 3, the good DEFINITELY outweighs the bad for this laptop. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great, reasonably priced laptop."}, {"name": "John Cowart", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2020", "title": "System is fine, support sucks wind.", "review_text": "I purchased this system on Nov 29th and received it Dec 1st.  Good start.  Sadly in less than a month it lost it's wee little mind and failed to the point that I was unable to restore it.  Contacted Asurion as I'd been stupid enough to buy their extended support.  Well, they could not do a thing that I'd not already done myself.  The recovery partition was not accessible.  So, I called Acer directly.  They had me run through a number of steps that I'd already done on my own and decided (surprise) the recovery partition was hosed.  They sent me a USB recovery drive (11 long days of waiting with no working system.  And upon receiving it the system would no recognize the USB drive.  They then had me send them the system 2 days there as I'd arranged to expedited shipping 10 days in their repair facility and another 5 days for them to slow ship it back to me.  At that point the system had been nonfunctional or out for repair longer than I'd actually had it.  Yesterday it started getting funky again keyboard problems now.  After calling them once more and instead of putting up with another extended delay for them to play silly games I found a keyboard driver that would work on the system.  And fixed it myself.  Now admittedly I did used to work in tech support for computers a few years ago so may know more than most.  But really, I should not know more about their system than they do.  The system I note uses the new Unified Extensible Firmware Interface or UEFI for short which is a software version of an old BIOS system.  But being completely software dependent if it has a problem and you don't have another copy of it.  It's suddenly a rather expensive doorstop.  I liked my old BIOS system which could not be corrupted with out some major effort to do so.  UEFI in a few years will most likely be a good stable replacement for a BIOS but I'll hold off on buying another system from ACER for a while at least.  Not so much the hardware with is about average for the price point.  But their tech / customer support needs a lot of work IMO.

When I got accepted to the university of London. One of the first things I was told I needed was a laptop. Not just any PC; but a laptop. So immediately I was looking for something that's easy to move around with because of my busy life and also that has a stylus for running thru PDFs on Microsoft edge and highlighting as I go through tons of cases. This PC proves to be excellent. I will say it is NOT A LIGHT WEIGHT PC. At about 4lbs you can definitely tell when it's in hand. But I would brush that off when I consider I Got a pc with the specs of the latest flagship of other companies for 600USD less. I don't need a thunderbolt. So I didn't see the need to spend the extra 100USD to have it and the present usb 3.1 port fast charges my phone.  A plus for me. Also the screen is remnant of a 2014 flagship.  It's better than my iPad mini 1. But shows significantly less radience/saturation in colors than on my Samsung Galaxy Note 9.  It's somewhere in the middle. As it's for school and not graphic design I'm not bothered. I'd advise that if u have to use it for precise editing that you connect it to an external monitor as it does have the POWER needed for most intermediate work and an external screen won't cost much.

I have to say it is a very well rounded laptop. Very capable laptop for the price. I'll start with the processing capabilities, being an engineer I often find myself working on this laptop, most of all while on the road, and it never lets me down, very powerfull processor and coupled with the SSD and 16 GBs of RAM, you can run pretty much anything, I run AutoCAD, GIS, Lightroom, Photoshop, Premiere, and other software and the little machine never lets me down. I travel a lot so it being very light is a plus, the fact that it is 2 in 1 makes it a great companion to watch movies on the plane. Battery life is great, not the 12 hour life as advertised but I get between 8 or 9 hours doing light work or watching movies. Which is not bad at all. I don't use it as a tablet as much, but sometimes when laying in bed is nice to put it in my belly with the keyboard facing down to have the screen closer to me, the screen has good enough brightness, a bit dim I have to say but very good quiality images and sound is not bad either, although I do not care much about it since I always use my bluetooth headphones. Ok, now the cons. The overall build of the laptop is very plasticky, almost cheap, I guess they focused on the inner more than on the outs. Being plastic all over its very prone to scratching and peeling, I hate that, eventually would look for a skin or something to protect it. Also, the screen frame is quite flimsy, you can see sometimes a change of color on the screen due to the frame bending, at first I thought there was something wrong with the display but its just that is not very sturdy. Another thing I don't enjoy very much is the keyboard, it is weird, the travel of the keys is short and kinda sticky and in my case the S key sometimes was stuck, when I pressed it took like half a second to pop back up, it has gone away with use but it was very annoing, I even tried to remove it and clean ot but it still happened. The only thing that would make me swith to a new laptop sooner than I would like is the fact that it does not have a USB C port, nowadays everything uses USB C, even for charging the laptop and this one doesn't have one, that was almost a deal breaker for me. Also, keep in mind that this laptop being a 2in1 does not have a built in ethernet port. I gave it four stars either way because is it very realiable, lightweight and I use it a lot and everytime it comes trough for me.

First off, the shipping done by Amazon was not all that great. There wasn\u2019t even done bubble wrap or air packets to safeguard the package. Coming to the laptop, first impressions were good. I opened the laptop screen and voila. Three big issues, 1) The laptop display panel was coming out from the laptop lid so much so that the backlight and everything was visible (see attached image for reference). 2) One of the display hinges (right hand side) had already gone kaput. It\u2019s alignment was off and the display was swinging back and forth without any adjustment being done. 3) The touch pad was a nightmare. Not sure if it was just my laptop or if it\u2019s the same with all Acer Spin 3s - the touchpad kept getting depressed for every touch when in reality it should actually get depressed that much only while clicking. The fact that the touchpad surface wasn\u2019t all that great by itself wasn\u2019t helping matters. The whole laptop (construction and quality of a materials used) felt a little cheap and plasticky. Didn\u2019t read this on any other reviews so I thought I\u2019d mention this - the power button is placed very weirdly on the left side of the laptop towards the front. Quite an odd position and not very comfy either to use. PROS - I used the laptop for a couple hours and the battery life seems to be good.

For one, while the computer seems generally fingerprint-resistant, I've had issues with smudges already and they're a little rough to remove sometimes - especially sticker residue (which I believe I got a little bit of from the specs sticker). Two, I'm not a fan of the bezels and the screen ratio in tablet, though I understand why the large bezels in some spots may be necessary.

The wifi toggle key on the keyboard as well as num/caps lock keys are pretty annoying, there is no indicator lights to display their toggled status, so you will have to run your usual linux commands to check their status while installing, be careful with the network toggle key while installing. Currently, the drivers for the touch display screen are not available in Linux for this model of Acer, so there is absolutely no luck in getting xournal++ up and running after a successful installlation of your OS and GUI. I'm using it as a travel laptop for linux development, and for that purpose it is incredibly useful.

Pen works great and has a nice bezel for easy grabbing. Great for drawing or just multitasking with touchpad. Great precision point touchpad. This computer can easily handle, video streaming, casual gaming, creating and editing documents, or even photo and video editing. The ports are really nice as you get HDMI and 2 USB ports. One is regular 2.0, while the other is a really fast 3.1 Gen 1.  Really long battery life too. I can use it for long times and even game on it for like 3 hours straight without it dying. Everything is lit up, so it is easy to see and use. Great chiclet style keyboard. Restart time is like a whooshing 6-8 seconds. Doesn't have USB Type-C or a facial recognition camera, but it still works wonderfully. Really fast fingerprint scanner, which works efficiently and reliably. The 2-in-1 functionality is great too, and the hinge isn't too stubborn.  Speakers are pretty decent as well. This is also surprising light as it packs a great punch.

This chromebook has far exceeded my expectations. This is my first time using a chromebook. I have had a week or so to really dig into the device. I own an alienware gaming laptop, but I find myself only using it now for gaming purposes only. This chromebook is fast in my opinion. The speed is snappy and the device responds quickly to gestures and commands. I have yet to find sometime I can't do on this that I do on my windows laptop aside from gaming. One game I like to play requires windows, mac, or linux. Since this has an ARM processor it does not support linux applications at this time. Design: This device is a bright attractive white chromebook. I find the design to be pleasing to the eye and appears sturdy even though it is made from plastic. I do not particularly like using it in tablet mode. The screen feels bulky and sometimes unmanageable in tablet mode. The screen quickly transitions to whatever position to place it in whether laptop, tent, or tablet mode. I personal find myself not even using my LG tablet for much of anything except when I need LTE internet away from home. Overall the design is great. Screen/Input: I find the keyboard to be on par with most laptop keyboards. The keys are a little shallow and I feel my typing has slowed a little bit, but not by much. The IPS touchscreen is very responsive and rarely find myself having to touch the screen more than once for my intended gesture. Screen is bright in home conditions, but feel it would lack in more intense lighting situations, such as outdoors. Ease of Use: The google play store makes this thing be able to do just about anything. I have not tried any intense applications. I use chrome, netflix, hulu, evernote, several banking apps, and various other apps. All of them are snappy responsive. The bank apps load like they are in phone mode, thus they are in a small window. The apps still work as designed. Netflix and Hulu playback is smooth and pleasant to watch on the screen. Overall, I am impressed with the Google OS and this device in general. If your someone who is on the fence about the operating system, I suggest you give it a try. The battery life is good as well. When using my gaming laptop its always with a cord tethered nearby. I also understand a gaming laptop is far more power intensive. I have yet to use this chromebook while charging it. The battery has allowed me to watch 4-5 hours of netflix, talk on facebook, and text through my phone without ever getting critically low. I charge it at night and then never put it back on till the next night. This is a max screen brightness. I was also very surprised with the speakers. The speakers were much louder and not distorted. I honestly expected them to be cheap netbook quality that is mostly better just to never use them, but thats not the case with this chromebook. I do generally use a bluetooth headset. The bluetooth headset paired with extreme simplicity. I also set up my brother wireless laser printer with google cloud print in less than 30 seconds. Google did it right and lenovo delivered a solid product. I did purchase this on sale for $200 but would have spent the $300. If your a web surfer, music listener, netflix watcher I highly recommend this. If you need windows intense software then go with windows.

Better Chromebooks have Intel Core CPUs for great performance.

On the plus side this Chromebook has a useful 4GB of RAM, a sharp colorful IPS screen, a touch screen that works great with Android apps, a very responsive (for swiping) touchpad, and reliable WiFi (much better than my HP laptop). On the minus side, the white plastic shell looks and feels a little cheap, the screen is not very bright, and the touchpad's button feels a little clunky. In summary, if you can't afford more than $300, this is a good choice for casual users who only have a few tabs open at once and use it mostly for email, Facebook, web surfing, and streaming music or videos.

One gripe however, the SD card slot is shallow; put a SD card in the it sticks out more than half the length. So you wouldn't want to leave the card in; must remove it after use. Of course, you know the benefits of a Chrome book. Light weight (in many ways, both software and hardware), no need for tedious OS upgrade, no worries about viruses while providing everything a computer user needs.

I had to return the first one I bought, because there was a problem with the sleep and the bluetooth. Sleep, because when I would close the lid, it would just power off the device, rather than putting it in suspension. Bluetooth, because when connected to a bluetooth mouse for anywhere between 5 to 30 minutes, it will bug out and refuse to work again until it's rebooted. Now, I had thought that the problems might be related, and since it was a hardware issue, the replacement would be free of both problems. However, I was wrong, unfortunately. It seems the bluetooth issue is just what the device does. It's a bit disappointing, as my Moto X Pure Edition (which was the first Moto X made by Motorola after being purchased by Lenovo) had nearly this very same issue with its bluetooth. It makes me draw the conclusion that Lenovo makes poor decisions when they choose who they use for bluetooth radios. That aside, everything else about this Chromebook is fairly surprising. It's snappy, sounds good, looks good, works well. It's a lot better than it has any right to be at the price point they have it at. I am, again, disappointed that their cost saving measures had them put in a faulty bluetooth radio in them, but I will find a way. I work from this thing, so I can't be without it again, and I am not rollin' in the dough, so beggars and choosers and all that. If bluetooth isn't a huge need, this is the ticket. If bluetooth is a big deal, you might want to invest in a more expensive chromebook from someone like ASUS, who uses great hardware."}, {"name": "Wallygirl47", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2019", "title": "My Lenovo c330  chromebook is AMAZING! 4gb RAM and 64 gb", "review_text": "Before I share my thoughts on the product I would like to preface with a disclaimer that I am an educator who has used Chromebooks as a tool for teaching and for my own work projects.

No problems opening the packages or initiating start up with the Chromebook.  The winter white case is plastic and may require extra care.

I needed to replace my 9 year old Macbook Pro that was an excellent machine but just couldn't handle modern computing needs. However, I have a desktop for more intense computing needs, so I really didn't want to spend $1000+ on a new MacBook to browse the web, watch YouTube videos, read eBooks, watch Netflix etc in the evening. Cheap laptops in the sub $350 range are frankly almost all junk, so I wasn't really interested in buying one of those either. I don't want a tablet because I want a keyboard and I like to lie flat in bed and that's just not convenient. Enter the Chromebook! So far, this has been an impressive solution for the purchase price of $231. Of course, Chromebooks have a variety of hardware and you need to do your homework to get the best experience. For about $50 more than lesser Chrombooks, this is an ideal middle ground solution. Within its comparable price range, the MediaTek MT8173C processor scores at the top as far as processing speed. Coupled with 4GB DDR3 RAM and a 64 GB SSD for boot speed, plus how lightweight of an OS ChromeOS is, this is a very well performing little machine for the price. Web browsing is snappy, YouTube loads very quickly and the Google Play store gives you access to all the apps you need. So far, all apps have loaded without any issues and function well. The battery life is remarkable - I've gotten 13-14 hours of use from it and still had 15% when I finally plugged it in. ChromeOS is super easy to learn/user friendly and reminds me of the user experience of a phone/tablet. NOW - this machine is not a few things. It doesn't have a super high resolution screen, but it's a small screen, so it's not bad, but if you're used to a Retina screen it will be a bit lower in quality. It is fine and perfectly functional, but not exceptional, as a tablet (not the best touch screen response and obviously heavier than normal tablets and ChromeOS isn't as optimized for touch screen use compared to phone/tablet operating systems - think things like bigger front/back/X buttons - those aren't as prevalent on ChromeOS). The keypad is nice and sensitive but the click is loud. Printing is probably a pain but I have a desktop for that, so I don't care. So far, those are really the only cons I have found to this machine, but the pros far outweigh and you need to be realistic about features vs. price. It does a lot of things really well at the current list price of $251. It is not a $1000 laptop and you simply can't expect $1000 features from it. I'm very glad I spent the extra money for this over the sub-$200 Chromebooks with lower quality hardware and no convertible/touch screens. The convertible/touch really makes it fun to use. So, in summary: If you just need a machine to do run of the mill browsing, streaming, etc I think this is an almost perfect solution and an excellent value for the money."}, {"name": "Reese", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2019", "title": "Chromebook is bugged", "review_text": "After using it for an hour the mouse will start moving around erratically.

Very Impressed.", "review_text": "Regarding Chrome OS.  This is my first chromebook so I'm still learning, but so far I'm extremely impressed!  It seems like the chromebook was the computer I've always needed but never realized I wanted!  Marrying the pc experience to an android compatible operating system is magical.  Although I'm apprehensive about this browser-based computing, I've found it very easy to save and edit documents offline so I'm still able to work on the go.  I can also connect it to my android phone, send and receive text messages with it, emulate old school video games (GBC, NES, SNES, GBA, and NDS), connect it to my bluetooth speakers and blast some jams.  I regret not making Chrome OS a part of my life MUCH sooner! Regarding performance.  I've heard people say this processor is mediocre.  I have to ask, what are those people even doing to arrive at the conclusion?!  I have not once seen the slightest indication that this thing isn't *completely* competent for daily needs.  Incredible response time.  No lag when scrolling.  Minimal to no delay opening apps.  Stunningly fast start up time.  I feel like it's a pretty outstanding performer, overall.  Sure, it's no high end gaming machine, but who buys a Chromebook looking for advanced gaming capabilities?  The bottom line: you click; the computer responds instantly.  Really, what more could you ask for? Regarding the build quality.  It's a bit bulky in its \"tablet\" mode and lacks the premium build materials of high end chromebooks, but it still looks and feels great - certainly better than any laptop PC I've ever owned!  The white color is gorgeous.  The size is perfect.  The keyboard is comfortable and the touch pad is large and responsive.  If you look closely you'll see Lenovo coated the touch pad with a hefty clear coat to prevent wear and tear.  As someone who immediately coats touch pads with contact paper to prevent damage, this is an impressive step, however inconspicuous to the average user.  Additionally the hinge feels solid and smooth.  The construction of the entire build just feels extremely sturdy.  The monitor produces extremely sharp images with outstanding color.  Although many people express dissatisfaction with the lack of 1080p and the larger bezels framing the monitor, I didn't even notice!  If you're not planning to do professional photo editing, I doubt you'll notice either.  (Side note: If bezels really concern you, consider the experience of flipping this into tablet mode and walking around with it while working.  Wider bezels in this situation result in fewer accidental screen taps from fingers that are curled around the edges holding it.) I absolutely recommend this chromebook.  It's a steal at this price point, and stands to replace my quad core, 8gb Windows 10 laptop for most of my computing needs.  Sure, it's not a 1080p monitor, lacks a backlit keyboard, and isn't made out of aluminum, but goodness gracious if isn't the coolest, most practical little laptop I've ever owned.

After the usual initial setup (which is very easy due to the simplicity of Google), the battery life is definitely longer compared to my old Chromebook. I didn't really clock it but even with multiple tabs running at full brightness and full audio, id say it was about 5 hours before I had to plug in, which sets you up for a good idea on how long it performs when you're frugal with your power usage. Audio was very clear, screen had good resolution and responsive touch feedback (but a fingerprint and smudge magnet!) and does well in the multiple tablet modes while still staying snug.

If you can keep your work limited to stuff you can do in Chrome (and *some* Android native apps), then this particular machine should be able to get the job done. With that being said, my machine had issues with Bluetooth that I simply couldn't ignore.  Normally, I don't utilize bluetooth very often, but due to the nature of this device and the way I wanted to use it (i.e., highly portable with the 2-in-1 feature), I planned the purchase around it.  The Bluetooth was essentially non-functional.  After looking into it, I found that basically every Chromebook has issues with bluetooth (so it's not necessarily specific to this device), but despite trying everything I could to get the bluetooth even mildly functional (trying beta builds, updating drivers, experimental Bluteooth software, etc.), nothing worked.  Specifically, I could connect to the machine's bluetooth, but after a few minutes, the blueooth would completely cease to work and would only work again after a reboot. After realizing that I wasn't going to be able to fix this problem, I returned the device.  I then bought another 2-in-1 Chromebook that was a little more pricey (I'll try to avoid outright advertising for them, but it was $500 Samsung device, so it cost twice as much).  This device is leagues better. First, the bluetooth actually works.  I still see many of the \"quarks\" that every Chromebook has, but I an actually use the Bluetooth with little issue.  But, that's not the only improvement.  The machine itself is significantly faster, which may not be of much value for most, but certainly improves my experience.  The touchscreen is also drastically superior, allowing for active pen use.  Again, if the \"touchscreen\" portion of these devices aren't that big a deal, then this might not matter, but after using the active pen, I could never go back to a simple touchscreen.  On top of this stuff, the new machine is much lighter and much more comfortable.  I've had people comparing it to an iPad when in tablet mode, which was certainly not the case for the C330. All in all, the C330 is a fine device, but it attempt to be too much of too many things, and doesn't do any of it right.  It's cheap, which is a big plus, but not cheap enough.  It's a 2-in-1, but isn't very good as a tablet.  And it's a Chromebook, but slow and not completely functioning.  I'd suggest either going cheaper and finding a Chromebook that isn't a 2-in-1, or spending the extra money to find a proper 2-in-1.

As of the late March 2019 manufacturing run, version 70 comes installed.  You need at least version 72, if you expect to run Linux, from the get-go. For right now, the only thing that really surprised me about the unit, which may or may not be a \"standard Chromebook thing,\" is that I have (until now) never seen a physical keyboard that was labeled with lower case letters on it!  Speaking of the keyboard, for those who are wondering, the keyboard is disabled after the hinge goes beyond 180 degrees.  It does feel \"weird\" however, to feel the keyboard pressing against your fingers or lap, when using the Chromebook in tablet mode. ********** 2019-04-27 Update ********** Because the display side of the clamshell is so lightweight; when used in \"laptop mode,\" it is very sensitive to motion transfer, and may show signs of noticeable vibration."}, {"name": "Zach Passmore", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2019", "title": "READ BEFORE YOU BUY", "review_text": "I did the research, read the reviews, and like whoever is reading this, thought I'd go out on a limb and try a Chromebook.

Everything I need to do on a laptop functions within the browser. Web apps are a thing in case you need certain desktop functionalities in a pinch. But I would like to reiterate: think of this as a lightweight device that runs a very optimized and very fast web browser. And I mean that; the browser on this thing can handle as many tabs as I would ever need at once. The OS itself is also smooth and responsive. This thing boots up in 5 seconds flat which is a miracle compared to windows laptops I have used in the past. Something important to note is that storage on this thing... isn't a thing. Well it is, but without a third party file explorer you are going to be using Drive as your main storage. Which is great because I was able to redeem the 100 GB free two year storage with my Chromebook. I recommend using cloud storage with Chrome OS anyway, as it will keep the operating system running quickly and it's just more convenient once you get used to maining it.

Solid, beautiful Chromebook.", "review_text": "I'm new to Chromebooks but not new to computers. I am an old soul who learned DOS and so I'm most happy with something like Linux and therefore the Chrome OS being based off Linux and the ability for newer Chromebooks to run Linux and open source programs like LIbreOffice are extremely important to me. I recently spilled a whole glass of wine right onto my HP Chromebook 14 therefore I had to buy a new one (even after taking the laptop apart to dry it out). This Lenovo is beautiful. The quality is far greater than the HP piles of junk out there. The screen is magnificent for such a cheap little thing. I like the fact I can use my Logitech Blutooth keyboard and therefore hopefully never spill anything again. That's the beauty of Chromebooks though - everything was backed up online and I didn't really lose much. Picked up where i left off with this wickedly good Lenovo. I have used a lot of machines - including Macs and Dell. I don't feel the price for those things are justified in anyway unless you are a full time graphics dev or designer and need heavy overpriced programs like Photoshop. There are superb alternatives with open source. Inkscape, GIMP, Scribus...and more. Cheap Chromebooks can't do everything but they are getting better all the time. I highly suggest updating Chrome when you buy this laptop, restart it then open settings and turn on Linux Beta. Learn about the programs you can run and how intelligent Linux is at installing them. Overall I love the size of this Chromebook. The screen is clear and gorgeous. Resolution is wonderful. Wish the laptop had more than one standard USB port but I'll manage. (I back up all locally kept files onto a USB drive or sometimes Google Drive). Touchpad seems responsive. The ability to use the laptop as a computer or tablet is fluid and no complaints.

It is definitely worth the price of around $300. It is small, lightweight (although could be more), responsive, looks great, smells new after months, smooth to use, track pad is pretty good, overall good chromebook. I'm not really too much of a Tech person but grew up with computers in my 20's mostly using it for school and personal stuff. I had it for a few months now so my beginning concerns aren't the same as my latter ones. I'll try to go over really quickly the basic beginning concerns I had then go through with my impressions with months of use later on. 1366 X 768 isn't HD but it's acceptable. Processing speed is 2.1 ghz, never had a problem or issue with lags. 4 gb ram is okay, probably wouldnt do 2 gb. 11.6 screen, I wanted something smaller so this is a plus to me. Bit heavy with 2.64 lbs for a small laptop but it's okay, still my lightest one. internet connection is good and bluetooth use was good. Processor never had a problem with Mediatek. Convertible to tablet mode is a plus. Solid state so processes quickly which is a big plus. Battery life is great, I hate charging and finding an outlet, but this goes on for more than 8-10 hours, just doing school stuff, no videos. I would say I searched like crazy in the beginning. I wanted one main personal laptop and one small convertible laptop and this was the best convertible one I could find on Amazon. I compared like 20+ laptops over a week, I was really putting a ridiculous amount of time on it. But I had specific things I wanted in mine, like speed, aesthetics, smooth performance, and valued those more than other things. I wanted things to be really convenient. I have started using chromebooks more because they are inexpensive and very convenient to use. They aren't too good for hardcore processing, but for school work or personal work, it meets all my needs. Whenever I use it, everything is pretty smooth and seamless. Start and shut down are almost instant. I have never had an issue with it's use so far. I think for me, the biggest plus is the elegance. It makes everything very easy to use, it looks great, it even retains its new smell after some months with light use. My other laptops have poor track pads but this one is infinitely better. I don't feel the need to use a wireless mouse as well. I ended up getting a screen protector for it for almost $20 because it was a touch screen. I like how it has a lot of features like hdmi cables, one usbs, even a memory card slot. I think for the price, it is definitely worth it. It feels like a very high end chromebook, although I generally wouldn't pay too much for a laptop in general because I don't need high processing. The buttons feel nice and smooth. There hasn't been much lag or delay time. Updates are easy and smooth. Screen is nice to look at and the colors are great. There doesn't seem to be much glare and it feels aesthetically pleasing. Yeah everything's really nice with this. There are some things I don't like about it though. Originally, I had planned to use this as a tablet part-time because I didn't want to buy paper textbooks. I thought of using all of it on this chromebook, but it turned out to not be convenient because it was too heavy. I would use it on the train and my hands would almost immediately get tired trying to read. I would have to rest is down on myself, which isn't a big deal but wanted something I could read ebooks and pdfs on conveniently. I don't know if I will end up getting another one to serve that purpose. It also is a chromebook so it cannot download files and stuff. I don't particularly like that because that stops it from being my main computer. I don't like putting personal stuff on my drive, like my expenses or whatever even though it is irrational and I do it with some apps. Maybe I should, but the fact that everything is on my drive to see makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. I don't mind that this computer cannot really do much without internet because I always have something saved on it. It has 64 gb of memory which I think is quite significant. I mean, if I couldn't put anything on the drive, I wouldn't feel that, but 64 gb + drive storage seems more than enough and I am trying to be a minimalist anyway. Yeah not that many cons. Anyway, I wanted a inexpensive laptop but this definitely performs up to par with most laptops. Never had a problem with it so far months into my purchase but did want something I could use as a tablet. Would definitely recommend. Definitely better than a lot of the stuff I grew up with that cost 3x more.

I looked at reddit and saw that some people didn't have this issue while a lot did. So I bought another one to test out. It also had the same plastic tapping noise the first one I bought had. SO, I bought a third one. Same problem. The Acer R13 and my Acer E15 Windows laptop did not make these noises.

First of all let me say that I have purchased an Acer 11 inch Chromebook and returned it last week because it was well terrible. I read a lot of reviews on the Lenovo, watch a lot of YouTube videos and I was fairly confident that I would be happy. I have to say I was not disappointed. The device shipped in typical Lenovo fashion and not too fancy packaging power cord small little booklet actually a pamphlet and the device itself. First things first the bad. There's not much bad to say about this device if you expected to be a gaming machine you will be disappointed it's a Chromebook. The display is IPS although it's slightly washed out the colors but sharp enough. The main drawback is the lack of ports there is one USB 3.1 and of course the USBC that is used for the power cord. You could use adapter and have 2 USB ports but this was she would be much better suited at least in my mind if it had at least two USB ports. Secondly the SD card, full size by the way sticks out way past the form factor making it not really a good way to store data. Unfortunately it doesn't go all the way in the body and it should. And last is it's White blizzard white is the only at color it comes in I don't know what's up with that. Now for the good and there's lots of goodness here. The quad-core mediatek processor is fast, at least fast in terms of what a Chromebook is. The touchscreen highly responsive the touchpad does not feel cheap and works really well although full disclosure I like to use a mouse. The case itself is made of plastic but it feels solid is no bending just a really nice quality filled to the tablet / Chromebook. Nice a tablet / Chromebook because it really is a Chromebook or laptop it doesn't work real well as a tablet it's a little big keyboard is on the other side but it works real good in tent mode that's for sure.

Some of the options in different apps and in chrome browser don't respond.  And the bezel at the top, when in tablet or tent mode, is very distracting.

This chromebook is fairly light and small and gets the job done and there little to no wait time when you open the chromebook turning on automatically. There a bunch of things i noticed while using it is you can link your phone with the chromebook in where once you previously log into the chromebook beforehand you can unlock your chromebook right after by unlocking your phone (both have to have bluetooth enable). To search up shortcuts you can easily click the search button on the keyboard and type in shortcut and it have it where you can search all the shortcuts you can do and what nice is any additional keyboard say a bluetooth one can also do some of the shortcuts. Also there are options where you can close the laptop and you have two options you can either put the laptop to sleep or it just turns off the screen then there a option to lock it by closing it or not. nice note is if you have display off you can still listen to pandora,mp3,or youtube. Also for those who are wondering - you can play minecraft, ragnorak mobile (not fully keyboard control it only for texting in chat so no WASD movement) and hearthstone on it so it have it nice touch but you cant use the split screen feature from chrome so that a bummer now for the drawbacks. Also you can use microsoft word, excel and powerpoint from the googleplay store but you would need a account for it or just use the free online version. This is small nit pick - the screen is 720p yet it clear but it is noticeable when you use it long enough wish it was HD or 1080p also some apps are set to the 720p by default. the google play store youtube uses the quality of the screen while chrome youtube (basically youtube normally on browser) is more clear. Also skype doesn't have screenshare or sharesound so that a major bummer and skype seem to run slow on the chromebook in terms having people sharescreen their desktop it always come out blurry on some occasions and i have to minimize and reopen skype to actually see what going on. i haven't try video call yet so it up to debate. Lastly for discord from google playstore you would need to adjust some of the call setting for it to work. the default setting would cut you off mid sentence and random pausing in between. Another thing is you can't adjust the idle timer it either it goes to sleep, display turns off or stays on there no option to change it and when you have option to lock your desktop it end your skype call so you would have to go into settings for normal use, call use, and game use. lastly is your better off having your laptop go into sleep mode with locked instead of turning it off. when you shut it down the screen goes blank white then gets brighter and brighter then goes to black. it's just me being paranoid like it would be better if it just dims and turns off instead of going very bright then poof black not to mention if you usually play on medium to low brightness setting then having your screen go maximum brightness with no setting to change it get annoying not to mention when you open up your chromebook after shutting it off it adjusted your brightness setting as well as well a bright chrome logo before going into login. Mostly this is a nit pick since it bothersome when you are using it in middle of the night then when you turn it off it hit you with the brightest setting so i just end up closing it to sleep mode or shut off and look away. All in all it a pretty good chromebook i just wish it had more options in the settings as well have priority app settings in task manager"}, {"name": "Matthew", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2019", "title": "One year later......", "review_text": "I had to come on here and review this tablet because of how much I love them.

Pros: The battery can last a whole day of good usage, the screen quality is great, the keyboard feels nice, and my favorite thing: it's FAST! I was so sick of my slow as a** clunky hp laptop. It takes probably like 10 seconds to start up, and pages are quick to load. The laptop is a perfect size for sitting on your lap or putting in your bag, and it's really light to carry around. Not necessarily \"cons\", just stuff that takes a little to get used to: Like with any chromebook, most of the \"apps\" are just in another window of the browser. That being said, I managed to find a good add on to chrome for spotify and discord, but if you use other apps that you're used to on pc or mac, you might find that a problem. With microsoft apps, you could just use the online versions and they work fine for my student purposes. The touchpad feels a little inaccurate, but after some use, I got used to it. The two-finger scrolling and zooming feels nice, though. Also, the speakers are kinda washed out but again, I got used to it. Actual cons: It's crashed on me a handful of times already... normally, it's just a little annoying since it starts back up so quickly, but recently I had it crashed TWICE during an online midterm.

Fortunately, I was able to get this next-day Prime delivered to where I was staying in LA and began using it minutes after it arrived. To make this review easy, I'm breaking it down by main key features: display, keyboard, battery life, and build quality. Display: For the price, I don't think you're going to find one much nicer in terms of resolution and quality. Incredibly, you are getting a true IPS panel with nice viewing angles. I've found that the low res matte displays on other cheaper Chromebooks are incredibly difficult use and lead to eye strain. I'm a personal believer in purchasing as much screen real estate and pixel density as possible -- it really does make a huge difference. Another huge plus (and I'm not sure if this across the Chromebook line or specific to this one) is the night mode that cuts out blue light and boosts yellows -- this is another hugely important feature for me, personally. Touch screen functionality works fine. Display cons are that the bezels are massive and with it being super glossy, there can be lots of glare. Keyboard: Basically Lenovo has it figured out with keyboard layouts and feel. While it's nowhere near as nice as the Thinkpad keyboard, this one is laid out quite nicely and is easy to complete bigger writing assignments on. There's no backlight, which would be a huge plus, but for the price, it's difficult to find anything to complain about. The top row function keys will be familiar to those coming from the Mac ecosystem. Everything is very easy. The trackpad is also surprisingly nice for the price as well. Gestures work without issue. Battery life: This is where this computer truly shines. I purchased this while I was traveling during the winter and needed to it to complete weekly freelance assignments and had plenty of battery life while on the road. Even when being back home laying in bed watching Youtube or Netflix, the battery lasts all night, and then some. I basically never take the charger with me because I don't feel that it's necessary (unless it's already low on juice). In terms of just general surfing and Google doc stuff, you should be able to get a couple of days out of the battery. If you're watching videos and streaming, it's still a good full day's worth of battery life. Build quality: I've previously had an HP Chromebook and was not impressed by the build quality by any means. It felt cheap, almost like a toy. While this Lenovo Chromebook feels much more solid, I still wouldn't compare it to a Thinkpad or the higher end machines in Lenovo's lineup. Still, it feels quite durable and I've never worried about carrying it in a pack all day, or stacking books and other heavy items on top of it. The only thing that is kind of a bother is that the brilliant white finish does get smudges and dirty fingerprints on it. But that's more of a nuisance, not a flaw with the machine. For the price, you really can't do much better. So long as you have reasonable expectations for what you're getting and how much you're paying, you will be very pleased by this product."}, {"name": "Fred Mellender", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2019", "title": "Great as a bedside device", "review_text": "I bought this to replace a Google Home (GH) \"Smart Speaker\" on my bedside table.

Also, I rarely use tablet or portrait positions on this tablet because it's so awkward. It's made to be used vertically and it's a bit bulky. But it's great for apps and video. Overall, I'm happy, but for the price point some things could be better.

Acer Chromebook was showing its age, I decided to upgrade to a newer model and found the Lenovo model appealing for a number of reasons, including that it had USB-C charging.  FINALLY, a charging standard that manufacturers can agree on!  And for its performance, I've been pretty content with the C330 - it's nothing to write home about for good or ill, but it's a solid little machine for what I need.  And, honestly, I probably put it though more strain than a Chromebook ever should, given how many tabs I keep open.  BUT (and there's always a but, isn't there?)... Lenovo, what the heck is going on with this charger?! Seriously - the charger for this Chromebook is HUGE, but that's not the problem with it - the problem is it doesn't work reliably!  I first noticed it a few months ago - the charger would mysteriously stop working for no apparent reason.  Because the display dims automatically when the charging cuts out, it became INCREDIBLY annoying if it was sitting on anything less than 100% stable because it would flicker backlight brightness, so I took to unplugging the USB-C cable when I'm going to be surfing for a little while.  Then, the charging became even LESS stable - it began requiring tweaking the cable slightly to get it to charge.  Now, it's getting to the point where I have to play the old coat-hanger-antenna trick with the charging cable to get it to charge - tilting and turning the cable and the laptop this way and that just to get it to charge.  And no - the problem ISN'T the charging port, as it has no problems with my roommate's USB-C charger, just the one from the box. For a modern laptop, instability in charging is inexcusable.

I decided to get one because most of what I use a computer for doesn't require anything more heavy duty than what this has to offer. I'll still use my other computer should I require things like Photoshop or those heavier use programs, but since I got my Chromebook a week ago, I haven't even touched my other laptop. The Pros: Battery life - When it estimates that I have 12-13 hours of battery life, it means it. I can stream videos and multitask and it doesn't sacrifice that time. Time to charge is also impressively quick. Speed - I open the lid and it's on. It's that simple. No waiting for everything to load up. I had to do an update and it took maybe 10 seconds, including restart time. I know internet will vary depending on network, but I'm able to easily multitask and it's not dragging. I'm currently casting a video to my TV and have multiple tabs open on chrome, all with no lag to the video (which would often happen with my other laptop). Ease of use - If you're already a chrome/google user, switching over to a chromebook is a piece of cake. I didn't have to transfer anything, and I do have to eventually back a few more things up to my Drive, but again, that's easy. Getting used to more app-based programs than desktop ones is easy enough too.  Almost everything that would have required a windows download has an app version or a way to use it on a chromebook as well. Screen/Tablet mode - I haven't toyed too much with the touch screen, but it's a nice perk. I like being able to flip the screen around and turn it to the side and bam, it's a big tablet. So far I've only used it like this once to read some comics, but it was nice. Brightness is great too. I usually have it down halfway or less even. Size - I was worried about it being too small because my other laptop is somewhere between 13-14'' but it's a really great size. This thing is incredibly light too. Much lighter than I'd expected. Love it. The Cons, though extremely minor: Caps Lock - Mostly, it's a \"getting used to\" factor that I just haven't quite mastered yet. There's no caps lock key, and the search button that replaces it isn't terrible, but I think I'd have preferred to just have the caps key. (You can just press alt+search for caps lock easily enough though) Backlighting - my other computer had backlit keys. Totally an \"extra\" that's not necessary, but regardless. And that's it.

You won't be able to install Linux over Chrome OS, since there aren't any ported flavors for the Lenovo Chromebook. Crouton behaves like a virtual machine with limited memory, so it Linux OS's on Crouton seem to freeze quite a bit.

This is an ARM device so many of the applications that work on the Raspberry Pi etc will work on this device. Once installed the program icons can be placed on the shelf to be started as any other app..

However, I'm a bit obsessive about fingerprints on my screens, so that drives me nuts. I picked up a Moshi TeraGlove which does the trick. But that brings me to the only real beef I have about this unit, which is the tremendous black bezel surrounding the screen. Fingerprints and smudges really stand out. I understand that might be something necessary for tablet mode, but I hate tablet mode, although I love folding the screen back for tent mode. From looking at the tablets of folks I know it's obvious fingerprints and smudges don't bother a lot of people. I'm adjusting. The display for video is fine, although large-font text is a bit fuzzy on certain sites. Maybe I need a new prescription. I've never met laptop speakers I like, so these sound no better or worse to me. The white plastic looks a bit goofy, but for $250, if you're a Chromebook fan there's nothing wrong with this device."}, {"name": "Max Moreira", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2019", "title": "It's very good for the money", "review_text": "Ok my review on this Chromebook will be detailed 1. The screen: Considering this Chromebook is very cheap. It's a nice screen, it has good quality, not so great color accuracy, but it's still great. It's touchscreen and it responds great. No problems at all. 2. Keyboard: This keyboard let's me type fast. Really fast. It has good travel, it feels quick. It's very nice! 3. Audio: Here is where I spected a downside but no, it sounds good. Not very loud to be honest but good quality. The speakers are down facing like most of the regular laptops nowadays but it sounds very good, even if you put it on the bed. 4. Battery Life. You can easily get 14-15 hours of light use(Surfing on the web, reading). 10-12 Hours of moderate use (working on documents, watching YouTube videos, Netflix) 8 hours of heavy use (Gaming) 5.  Look & Feel Looks nice! No problem, it looks like a Lenovo laptop, very formal, very professional, it does have that Chromebook logo that screws up a little bit the professional look but that's fine. It feels strong, it wont fall apart very easily, it won't scratch easily too because it's like hard plastic but very well made. To finish I would like to say that if you're on a budget and need a laptop that can get the job done, this is for you. Remember this is a Chromebook and ChromeOS is more like it was an Android tablet with steroids . You can't freely install any software here, like Microsoft Office, Photoshop, etc, you're basically stuck with the web versions of those, but again this is to keep it simple."}]},

Hughes", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2017", "title": "Sort of ruggedized, sort of kindergartenized", "review_text": "I've been a Chromebook fan since 2015. Many people writing reviews on Amazon about their frustrations with certain Chromebooks are almost entirely confused about-- or unfamiliar with-- the OS, so they take it out on the machine. That's not fair or accurate. By way of background, I also need to explain that I bought a pair of ASUS C100PA-DB02 10.1-inch Chromebook flips with touchscreens back in 2015. They have very glossy/shiny screens which glare, but the touch screen feature is nice. They also feature an actual aluminum metal chassis which is very elegant and classy looking (although prone to scratches). I saw this \"ruggedized\" version of a Chromebook on Amazon and thought I'd pick one up. I'm already an Asus fan, I like the Chromebook OS, and I was looking for a more durable Chromebook to literally throw in my backpack or briefcase and head out the door-- without worrying about a sleeve, case, or possible scratches if none of these was used. Well, this \"ruggedized\" version looks like it'd be great for children. Not so great for professional adults who've been spoiled with the nicer Chromebooks or laptops. I don't mean to be harsh because the chassis isn't awful, but it does have more of a look of Fisher Price or Leapfrog than Apple or PC. The Screen: The screen on this laptop is dimmer and more grainy (of that makes sense) than my other two laptops (both my other Chromebook and a PC laptop). The screen is anti-glare to be sure (a good thing), but you can sort of see a matrix pattern on the screen (a bad thing). The colors are also ever-so-slightly more washed out and dull. I compared all the screens side-by-side. If you're a student or a parent buying this for a child in grade-school, I don't think you'll be disappointed. If you're a photographer, visual artist, or someone who with a keen eye who enjoys HD movies, you'll notice that this screen is simply not up to par with other laptops on the market. The Keys: The keys on this laptop are my biggest frustration. While many keyboards today are back-lit, that would be a luxury on a Chromebook. Fair enough. But is it too much to ask for high-contrast silk screening? Maybe a phosphorescent or white print color for the keys? Apparently so. This keyboard has mid-to-dark-blue lettering on black keys. A really, really stupid choice that makes no scientific or practical sense other than to match the color blue to the \"ruggedized\" cover trim. These keys will be hard to see in low-lighting. Lastly, the keys on this keyboard are noticeably taller than on my other Asus Chromebook. Probably twice as tall. You feel like you're typing on a manual typewriter. Very poor design choice. Summary: If I were a parent, I'd buy my kid this laptop in a heartbeat. It's compact, durable, water-resistant, has excellent battery life, access to the Internet, if used with Google Drive and Google Docs all work is saved and backed-up automatically, the laptop is somewhat immune to viruses, and it's certainly rugged. However, if I were a college student and wanted all the above *plus* the ability to really enjoy streaming movies and to comfortably type-up term papers for hours on end, I'd probably get a Chromebook with a nicer screen and better keyboard. Sadly, for me, this laptop was a no-go and I'll be returning it. Sticking with the aluminum Asus 2-in-1 with touchscreen. If you found this review, please give me a thumbs up.

I am a writer and I needed something simple without a lot of bells and whistles and whips and chains :)  This little Chromebook netbook is awesome for traveling.  It takes a little bit to get used to Chrome's operating system, but once you do you'll discover some very nice proprietary advantages. A small\u2014but nice thing\u2014is not having to right click any more; instead, you simply tap with two fingers for word corrections.  This is great for someone like me who writes a lot and needs to have a simplified workflow. The battery is long lasting and the keyboard is a perfect size, even for someone as big as I am. 6'3\" 300. Because I use google docs to write with, this seemed a natural step. Chromebook seamlessly integrates Google Docs, and most other important apps into the framework of the little machine, so it's very easy to use and get started. The offline stuff is very useful too as I'm not always in a place where there's wifi and I can still work on my books. Another nice feature is how light it is.  My wife bought a laptop a couple years ago and she would share it with me (begrudgingly) and I always hated working on it because it was big, heavy, and clunky.  This little Chromebook weighs next to nothing and is easy to tote around. All in all, I'd give this 10 stars if I could\u2014especially considering the price.

Of course it's limited in many, many ways, but that's the whole point of buying a Chromebook. I've been using this device for a little over half a semester in college for in class note taking, group work, etc. I use my desktop for any heavy duty stuff. It's worth noting that I rollerblade to classes, so I was looking for something as light as possible and as durable as possible. Pros: Very sturdy - I've dropped it many times and the worst that has happened is the rubber edging will have to be popped back into place. Simple as that and it feels totally firm and solid once it's back in place. It's great to not have to treat your laptop like the slightest bump could damage it. Fantastic keyboard - The keyboard has a nice \"chunk\" with each keystroke. The keys have enough travel and require enough force to avoid accidental keystrokes and typing feels great, even satisfying. Great battery life - I never bring my charger with me anymore, no matter how long I expect to be out. Good sunlight readability -  The screen does a pretty fine job of reducing strong glare. Cons: Weight - Though it's not particularly heavy for a Chromebook, its weight is a significant addition to my backpack. At just over two pounds, however, it's not a huge compromise in return for how durable this machine is. Sometime slow - As you'd expect. But honestly Chrome does a good enough job of managing resources that I only notice severe lag when opening presentations with many elements in them. All in all, this Chromebook has exceeded my expectations!"}, {"name": "Amazon Customer", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2017", "title": "In-Depth Review Sep 2017 - Great Product That Over-delivers", "review_text": "Great Chromebook! Bought as a replacement for my Lenovo Ideapad 310, AMD A12, 8GB Ram. The main reason for the replacement was battery life. Only getting 2-3 hours on the Lenovo, I needed something that could handle my digital nomad lifestyle. PROS: Battery Life - You can easily get 8-9 hours with moderate usage. Performance - I was a tad bit concerned with this factor, but with: ----- 21 tabs open ----- Keypress Editior (coding app from Chrome Store) ----- Webserver for Chome (running a local server for web dev, from Chrome Store) ----- Box SVG (creating & editing vector graphics app from Chrome Store) ----- Polarr (a really good image editior from Chrome Store) ----- Enjoy Music Player (another Chrome Store app) I haven't experienced any significant slow downs. Opening large SVG files or any other larger file, slows the system for a second or two (acceptable). Keyboard - I love typing on this keyboard. Even though it's smaller than my Lenovo, I type faster. Keys are well spaced and feel good to press. Also the key font size is a small aesthetic that you'll appreciate. Build Quality - I won't lie, it's ugly, but it feels very solid in hand. I'm not moving it around like it's a new born baby, as I was with my Lenovo. I can quickly take it out my backpack and slap it on a desk. All the ports feel strong and sturdy. My flash drive does not wiggle while inserted. Screen - It's good for the price, nice matte finish. I haven't had the urge to go back to my Lenovo (15.6) to watch a video or movie. It gets bright and dim to my satisfaction, nuff said. Charge Time - A fast charging device wasn't on my feature list, but this baby is fully charged from 35% in less than 1 hour. Better than my lenovo...I'll take it. Trackpad - It does what I expect and is perfectly placed. My only gripe is how loud actual clicks are, everyone at Starbucks will know when you double-click. Chrome OS - FYI, I'm coming from Ubuntu Desktop. From a bird's eye view Chrome OS may seem limited, but once you dig around the Chrome Store, you'll start finding apps for all your problems and fairly decent app replacements. Furthermore, there are a plethora of web apps outside the Chrome Store to compensate most people's unique necessities. Chrome OS + Google Play - In my opinion these two paired eliminate the \"OS Limits\". If you ever used Android, then you'll know there's an app for everything. I personally haven't even needed the Play Store yet, so I actually disabled it. Storage - I thought this would be an issue, but Google Drive is integrated very well. You get 120GB free for 2 years. You can also expand your local memory with SD card or flash drive. I always keep a flash drive backup. Speakers - As you can tell, I'm not super picky. These speakers get the job done, better than my Lenovo. I don't find myself plugging in my headphones to hear things better as I do with my phone and laptop. They get loud enough for me. Wifi - This was another huge issue I had with my Lenovo, mainly because I was using linux. Asus definitely delivers, connections are always strong and never drop. I'm using this Chromebook in the same locations as I did with the Lenovo. Bluetooth - I couldn't get it to connect with my phone. The pair would instantly drop. I haven't looked for a solution. I sure a bluetooth mouse or headset will work. It's well documented that not all phones pair with Chromebooks. Weight & Portability - It's nice and small, easy to carry around in hand as well as light on the back. Has a great rubber strip on bottom, that not only holds grip on tables and laps better than any other laptop I've owned, but allows it to be carried around like a spiraled notebook. Love Factor - It may be ugly, but I just love using it. It can do more than my phone and suitably replaces my laptop. Easy to carry around, not fragile, well built. It's the perfect piece of technology to augment yourself.

I was told that I had to pay the shipping to send it back, it would be gone at least 7-10 business days, and the manufacturer would deem if it was \"manufacturer defect or user damage.\"  If it was deemed damaged, we would be responsible for all repairs. After the phone conversation, I have no confidence that this company would take responsibility for it's defective product. I will not pay the money for shipping just for them then say it was damaged, when in fact it wasn't.  Please, save yourself $200 and buy another product by another manufacturer.

Setup is super easy and it runs incredibly fast. Many other computers take at least 2-3 minutes before I can do anything with them, but not this one! I can immediately get online and access documents without waiting or getting frustrated. The speakers are pretty good for the size of the computer, nothing super loud or anything, but definitely good and clear sound. The keyboard's letters are a light blue color and bigger than most other's. That does not make a very big difference to me, but it would help someone just learning how to use a keyboard or whose vision is not too great. I personally am not a huge fan of the touch pad because most of the time it is difficult or impossible to left click anything, but that was easily solvable by using a small, portable wireless mouse. It does effortlessly keep track of social media notifications, especially Facebook, which is a good but not overall necessary feature, at least for me. It has a good design and definitely would hold up to short distance drops or a little bit of water. I often take this to school and at times it sits in my hot car, but it always manages to work great when in use. My favorite feature of this computer? The battery life. Hands down, the battery life on its own is unbeatable. It lasts at the very least ten hours and I can get anywhere from 3-5 days use on one charge.

ASUS apparently has an exclusion in their warranty for anything that 'breaks'. If the technician hasn't 'been advised of there being a known issue/defect of that sort' the claim is denied. Funny isn't it, this way they never have to fulfill a warranty claim unless they have experienced the same problem in their lab, or they know they used inferior material somewhere, or? The whole reason for going with this laptop was their slogan of the laptop being 'rugged', thus a long lasting product which turned out to be a total scam. Don't get me wrong, if there would be a hole in the screen or a dent on the chassis, or water in the laptop, or anything clearly indicating an external force, i.e. stupid me breaking it, I am all for denying a claim, but this way, not acceptable.

I'll be going back to school in the spring and we thought it might be nice to have an extra computer around the house so we could both work on projects, or watch videos, or whatever at the same time. Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of money to spend so I really did my research before purchasing. I spent less than $200 for this little Chromebook and I think I really got my money's worth. With the exception of the storage capacity (which can be easily upgraded with an SD Card), it seems to be on a par with MacBook Air but for less than a third the cost. It's fast, easy to use, light weight, and durable. The last two qualities are especially important to me because I'm a cyclist and a strap hanger. If you travel primarily by automobile, you can't fully grok how important it is for someone who travels primarily by bicycle and/or bus to pack light and have durable, water resistant gear. It isn't mentioned in the product description, but I was pleasantly surprised that this Chromebook came with a 12 month accident protection warranty. To me that says a lot about Asus' confidence in the durability of their product. Admittedly, I am a big time Google user. I've had a gmail account for years and I use all the wonderful products - Drive (docs, sheets, slides, and drawings), Voice (both phone and sms), Hangouts, Keep, Calendar, etc - that google has. If you're like me in this you'll be very happy to see that this Chromebook is a natural extension of your blissful Google experience. One thing I would strongly recommend to anyone who decides to purchase this product is that you explore the help (?) section soon after you start it up for the first time. This is a Chrome OS so its slightly different than a Mac or Windows OS and will take a little getting used to. It's very intuitive and user friendly but you'll save yourself a lot of frustration if you take an hour to learn how to use it. All in all, I think this is an extraordinary product and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive, very portable computer for school or work.

Word documents are easily downloaded and Google docs can be converted to a word document. Super fast, doesn't take time to load or shut down. Make sure to fully charge before the initial start up but after that it's good to go. Doesn't take long to charge. I also got a Logitech wireless mouse for the computer and it worked perfectly.

This is a Chromebook and runs Chrome OS, which is primarily intended for web based computing. You cannot compare this to a Windows PC/laptop because it's completely different. If you educate yourself first to understand the software, functions, and limitations of the product, you can make an informed and wise purchase. As for me, I love it! It's a great compact size, is fast as lightning, runs Android apps (after switching the OS to the Beta channel) flawlessly, and works well with USB drives, memory cards, Bluetooth devices, and more. The lightweight footprint of the operating system is a plus because it boots and computes faster than most Windows laptops. The design of the device is rugged and feels very well made.

If you plan on video editing, this is no good. If you want to watch videos, this is great. If you want to play fortnite, this will not be any good. If you want to play farmtown on facebook, this will work great.  Its an excellent little laptop, that really isn't a laptop, but behaves a lot like one.  one of my kids uses this for her homework, and it is perfect. Her school books this year are all on line. The school provides office 365 for the kids. She brings it to school with her everyday, and she is very happy. Most of her friends all have a chromebook, and everyone says they like hers the best. This one is very sturdy and feels firm in your hands. The keyboard has a great feel - when you press keys, it has a nice click to it. Requires a good amount of pressure to type, but not too much. The battery life is great, easily lasts the entire day. Not heavy at all, its easy to carry around all day. For a teenager, its absolutely perfect. It is rugged, and water resistant, and somewhat immune to viruses.  Admittedly, we are big time Google users. We have had a gmail accounts for years and we use all the wonderful products - Drive (docs, sheets, slides, and drawings), Voice (both phone and sms), Hangouts, Keep, Calendar, etc - that google has. If you're like me in this you'll be very happy to see that this Chromebook is a natural extension of your blissful Google experience. However if I had to say anything negative, to me personally it almost looks like a toy.  More like fisher price or a leap frog, rather than an Apple of HP. So if you are a business proffesional and would have a hangup on something like that, you may want to consider a different style. But for functionality and price, you really can't beat it.  Here is one tip for you, if you have never used Chrome OS before One thing I would strongly recommend is that you explore the help (?) section soon after you start it up for the first time. This is a Chrome OS so its slightly different than a Mac or Windows OS and will take a little getting used to. It's very intuitive and user friendly but you'll save yourself a lot of frustration if you take an hour to learn how to use it.  I am considering buying a second one for me. This is what I plan on doing. I am sure you could install Ubuntu on it, and get myself a 64gb sd card, and I will have a fully functioning Linux computer. Linux software is all free, and much more reliable than windows. There is free office, free photo editing, free audio software.

The problem is everything else: once you're away from the Internet it becomes a $200 brick. If you plan on doing any kind of document or spreadsheet, you need to go through Google Docs.

Sometimes it doesn't work perfectly, you need to log back into your account. Sometimes you try logging in and it doesn't work for some reason. Then it completely freezes, so you need to close Chrome and try again. Then you finally get logged into Google Docs, you start writing your document and have a bad Internet connection for whatever reason. The second the Internet is gone, your document is frozen--can't change anything, can't copy or paste anything, nothing.

I just never know when I'm going to need to make a change to our website or utilize a Manufacturer's website portal.  Well.. Last weekend, I forgot my laptop and I desperately needed one... FAST.  I went to Staples and saw a Chromebook and was very skeptical.  In the store, I was able to access the website that I needed to work from.... Unfortunately, the Sales Person at Staples was 1) too lazy to see if the particular model that I was using in the store was available and 2) Actually told me that I would not be happy with this purchase and would likely return it and suggested that I shouldn't buy it... So.. I didn't. Instead, I borrowed a typical Laptop form someone and completed my work. I was still intrigued by the chrombook idea... So, I got on Amazon and found this little guy.. I figured that the water resistance on the keyboard might be helpful one day with the machine being primarily for the boat.  I also liked the rugged rubber on the outside.. I was concerned at first about the notion that this was a Student Machine... But... In reality, students are probably WAY ahead of me in computers at this point. I ordered this machine and in two days it arrived.  I LOVE it!  I am on the boat now typing and listening to Spotify on the machine at the same time.  It runs all of the programs and emails that I need for work and it is super light and easy to carry around.  It takes some time to get acquainted with some of the Chromebook processes and use features... Some are similar to standard PC but many are not.  I was very frustrated when some applications or websites wouldn't scroll down.. Then somebody showed me how two fingers on the touch pad at the same time allows for scrolling of any page. I have been able to access all spreadsheets that are emailed to me and open every business email or program.  I am going to keep using this as my primary machine until I find an application that I cannot do.  My biggest issue now is that this was designed to be left on the boat for emergency use, but I find it so easy to use and practical that I will likely be taking it home... Also, it operates very fast and I have had none of the issues with the touch pad or with slow operation that some people have mentioned in the reviews.  When you open it, it is ready to go.

I finally settled on this Chromebook, and man I'm glad I did. I was skeptical after reading all the reviews but I'm skeptical about everything these days. So in some of the reviews I saw complaints about screen quality, a cap lock button not working etc. Well, it's a Chromebook so it does not have a cap lock button, so that's a non issue. The screen quality doesn't compare to my iMac, but I wasn't expecting it to, my iMac cost me $1,300 and this Chromebook cost me $216. The screen quality I think is amazing for the price. It's not bad at all. It's not like playing an Atari or the old Sega genesis we had as kids lol. All in all I bought 3 of these Chromebooks and I think they are a great buy! They are very speedy for my slow internet connection and everything functions flawlessly and did I mention they are really easy to set up and operate!? This is just what I needed for the kids. Now I can stay organized with all of my kids school work, no fighting over my expensive desktop and the kids have everything they need in a compact Chromebook. I couldn't be happier with my purchase! They are plenty rugged (mind you they are still a delicate electronic device, I don't care how rugged anyone claims an electronic device to be, my children are going to be taught to treat then very delicately!). But they are rugged enough where I feel if there was a minor accidental drop etc, they would be fine. I say go for it! We love ours!!

Of course Chromebooks are fast and easy to set up. That is probably standard across the board no matter what brand you choose. What I like about this Asus Chromebook over some of the other Chromebooks I've worked on is the keyboard. It's keys are raised and not as flat. I prefer that for better typing as my own personal preference. I like the look and feel of this Chromebook. It's light weight and not bulky. The screen quality is nice. Someone in another review of this Chromebook commented that the blue lettering was hard to see on black keys. I have not had any issue with it. The blue is a baby blue which stands out fine on the keys, so not a dark blue on black. And my eyes aren't perfect, so I don't feel this is an issue at all. The touch mouse-pad is great.

I bought this pint sized device less than 6 months ago and it's already acting up. The random black outs mid task are driving me up a wall (although it takes less than a minute or two to reboot itself) no one should have to deal with that. Also, sometimes it will freeze if I'm watching a video followed by the loading circle \"not responding\" icon, that's fun too. I'm not one of those Internet users with tons of tabs or apps open 24/7 so I don't understand the crashes. There isn't a designated caps lock button, it is replaced with a search button instead... something that I personally do not care to ever use! On the bright side, it can be tweaked into being a caps lock button in the settings thankfully. (Random: there is no number keys on the right side either, just your designated numbers on the top row of the keyboard, it's compact so that's understandable...) If you're used to using a larger laptop, you will fall into the habit of hitting the screen lock/power button instead of the backspace button.... Slow blink. You'll eventually get used to it though. It's a notebook, so dont assume that you can download anything (software etc) or use this bad boy for music storage and photo albums because you cant.

So clearly there is a problem with the chromebook or the charger. I called ASUS warranty support.

She had no suggestion of where to go to find one or how I should make sure I got the right one, but just that I buy a charger and try it.  Really not helpful. So I asked what else we could do.  She suggested that I send it in.  Fine.  So now we are sending the notebook in, It will take 7-10 business days - so 2 or three weeks considering the upcoming holidays plus shipping time.  So we will now be out of use of this notebook which we really need for a month. She did offer me expedited return shipping at $30 but that's not really helpful. She also suggested I back up all my data before I ship it to them. Of course I can't power the thing on. So I asked her how I should go about doing that.  She suggested I take it to a local repair person to back up the data and that this person would be able to power it on and pull the data off.  No suggestions of where to go for that but apparently there is someone out there near me who can do this.  I guess.

I was skeptical about this chromebook because it's only 4gb ram and hardly has memory but everything gets saved to your Google drive. I did a little bit of research when I was laptop shopping and read that chromebooks don't need a lot of ram to run faster because they have an  SSD instead of the old HHD.

Totally random failure Rock solid little guy, of course google-chrome is terrible, but I always ran crouton(linux), but now that fails post nov-2018, so I'm using the new google supported 'linux' its ok, but very limited in memory/storage, as the google virtual box, doesn't let you use the external devices, which means your linux is limited to a total of about 8gb for all sys&apps, which ain't much if your running R&PYTHON and doing light development. Great little laptop, much better than ACER ( in terms of reliability ), but now I'm seeing that the infant mortality ain't forever, that 2+ years these little guys start failing. In terms of pure chrome, I think these are great for newbies who just want to shop & do social networking on a laptop, also great support for cameras and such built-in, of course its all SPY-WARE by default, so if your running in Google Mode, you must turn off all the default stuff that listens, watches, records everything you do, including phone, sms, email, sound, video, ... body-motion ( if your on a laptop) moderns 9-axis gravity chips can certainly monitor respiration, so in theory could know your excitability :) Great price, around $100  for a great little Laptop, certainly ONLY huge problem is lack of support for BIG devices, I was running a short 128GB USB thumb drive, but it literally burned up when used for crouton on these little laptops, not enough cooling, the SD-CARDS seem to run much more cool. But now that crouton doesn't work well with the newer version of chrome, your stuck with the new google version of linux, but for the virtual box doesn't support anything outside of a tiny virtual space allocated out of the 16gb total memory, remember if you move up to say 64/128gb chromebooks your talking almost $1,000, so its clear that this C202 is an entry, and the PAIN threshold is to get you to move to APPLE PRICING.

I have not tested out the water resistance yet, but it seems less likely to break when I inevitably drop it, mostly because it is very plastic-y.  Like another reviewer mentioned, it almost seems like a toy computer. It is about twice the thickness of my previous computer and there is a ridge on the base that I guess is supposed to help you grip it? I haven't found that particularly useful, but it does put the keyboard at a slight angle, which I like. Speaking of the keyboard, the keys are raised and the labels are bright blue (another reason it looks like a toy), which makes it easier to type on than most laptops I've used, but there is a noticeable clicking sound when typing. The trackpad also makes a clicking sound, and doesn't seem as sensitive as my other computer, two-finger (right) clicking is particularly difficult. My main complaint is the screen brightness, or lack thereof. It looks like an old desktop monitor, kind of dull and almost pixelated. It does boot up fast, and the battery life is amazing, right now I've been using it for over an hour with 10 tabs open, and the battery is still at 99%.

It booted right up and took off as I had hoped. There are 10 small Phillips screws on the bottom 8 you can see and 2 behind a thin plastic film. About that many hold the battery in. The whole keyboard pops off the base and there are two small ribbon cables attaching it. These cables are released by flipping up little \"doors\" on the receptacles and then the cable lifts out. There is a flat metal heat sink that goes over the battery held on by 4 screws. A 3rd ribbon cable crosses over the battery and plugs in to a circuit board using the same flip door receptacle as the other two. The battery has its own small plug that plugs into the circuit board.

I've always had good vision, but I had to buy reading glasses so that I could see the keys and I purchased stick-on labels with white lettering that make the keyboard more user-friendly for an older person.   I am a student and I found out that I cannot view MS Word files on this Chromebook. My instructors send Word files that I cannot open, so now, I have to use my old laptop for schoolwork. I use this Chromebook only for social media, as I cannot submit anything with Wordpad.   The third pain is the scroll bar on the right side - it keeps disappearing. I was able to modify the scroll bar so that it is easier to use, but it is still a major hassle. The arrow keys only work some of the time, sometimes switching the volume up and down instead. You need to stop what you're doing and use both hands to scroll down the page. Major inconvenience if you are holding something in your right hand.   Come New Year's Eve, I purchased a virus software because of the warning about Iranian hackers. When I tried to download the anti-virus program, but I was unable to because Chromebook doesn't use Windows. The software I bought was useless.   A fourth issue I am having is that I'm used to having a right-click button. If I want to copy/paste an image, I have to double-tap the keyboard or use Cntrl +C and my other hand again. I have bought a wireless mouse to make the double-click an easier process, but I'm disappointed that the manufacturer decided to omit this important feature.   The fifth problem is finding the date - I have to click on the bottom right corner and fetch my reading glasses to read the date - it's in the tiniest of letters.   The sixth problem is that I'm sick and tired of having to use my Google password to log in. If I go away for a few minutes, the screen turns black and I have to log in once again. I changed the procedure to just 7 numbers but its still a major waste of time, especially since I have to use two computers while doing homework, and the screen turns black all the time.

Parental controls need the ability to give the child access to a limited list of applications and an app shopping experience that is based on parental ratings so nothing that is inappropriate is available in the shopping experience.

Cons Pretty much all of the cons are to do with the chromeOS Poor compatibility with software. (You are limited mostly to google playstore apps unless you want to really work hard to install things.) Computer never fully turns off. (Both a pro and a con) Have to take the computer apart and void the warranty just to get full control of the device. Very small amount of storage space. (I ended up buying a small low profile flashdrive and use that for storage) If you are just going to use this as a laptop to browse the internet on or maybe do some banking on its the perfect laptop. If you had other plans I'd highly recommend getting a laptop that has windows installed even if you want to later install a linux OS its far easier to do that from windows than it would be from chromeOS."}, {"name": "Gwen", "rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2020", "title": "not great", "review_text": "I probably didn't look at the specs hard enough before ordering this, but I was seriously disappointed, and am returning it. The screen on it is small, which was, fine? I guess, but the ability to adjust it was lacking so everything was really blue. The video quality wasn't great, which, given the pandemic and the need to hold video conferences etc.. was a huge problem. When I ran Zoom I got an error message that my CPU usage was too high, and therefore it would cause Zoom call quality to be low. This was a HUGE problem because I need to have Zoom working for both work and personal life. I can't just switch platforms for video calls, because I don't control which ones are used. This laptop seems to want to market itself to students who are doing school online, but from what I understand, a lot of people are doing online school with said video elements, even pre-pandemic. Because of that it isn't actually a good laptop for that purpose. It was small, light, and rugged, I guess if you need it ONLY for internet browsing/using Google suite, it would be fine. But it wasn't for me."}, {"name": "anotherconsumer", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2019", "title": "weather resistant chromebook gets more outdoor time than my tablet", "review_text": "ASUS build is solid, water resistant, claims 10 hr battery (more like 9 plus so far) and handles Android apps now.

Attached to Deloren InReach gps/sat txt and using it with additional usb battery that has 19vdc  capacity. works ok and will handle libre office or apache office so I don't worry about being offline. tethered to my cell phone ok as well and home wifi works ok too. turning out to be a better replacement to my laptop and my tablet.

Seems very sturdy and good for children. Definitely not fancy. But I think it\u2019s great. There was only one learning site I could not access on this chromebook (but could access on my laptop). But everything else he able to do. I would recommend this. I did just order a mouse bc it was a little hard to teach him how to drag something using touchpad. Lol. Like I said, I don\u2019t know much about computers to say if it\u2019s a good value or anything. But from just an average user, seems great. Kinda like a computer android tablet.

It's now just about December 2019 and I'm writing this review on the Chromebook. It has survived countless falls on my hardwood floor (sometimes with the screen open), liquid spills, air travel in checked luggage, crumbs etc. It's still running strong. I recently lost the plastic piece that covers the front of the hinge to a particularly hard fall. This is just a cosmetic issue. Similarly, I've lost the down arrow key cover. The actual key still works without the cover. I will probably need glue it back on so it looks nice again. Everything else is still present, the Chromebook is in excellent working order and continues to run fast with regular updates. The battery lasts for days on a single charge, I haven't had any issues with shortening battery life at all. The one deficiency is that the screen quality isn't amazing but it's absolutely fine for most web browsing needs, and it doesn't have any dead pixels so far. I lost my previous Chromebook to a foster dog urine deluge which is why I decided to go with this ruggedized option this time around. Thus far it has outlasted both of my other past Chromebooks. Considering how much I paid for it and how often I use it, it's an awesome deal. If you (or your pets) are hard on devices, this is an excellent option."}, {"name": "Erika Uscategui", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2018", "title": "It's the perfect chromebook if you travel a lot and if you're clumsy", "review_text": "This is a great device for writing, it has a very very nice keyboard, decent screen (not mega HD but I don't mind), the battery is long lasting (almost 9 hours for me while watching videos), you can create documents offline which is very useful too and it came with a 12 month accident protection warranty for what I'm really grateful because I'm very clumsy. I'm in love with the keys on this laptop, I use it mostly for work and since I travel a lot it's perfect because it weights almost nothing and is very sturdy. The only bad thing is that when I write in Spanish it's a little annoying that I don't have the ''\u00f1'' key,  I had to choose US international (PC) keyboard to make it work properly and every time I need to write something like ni\u00f1o, se\u00f1uelo, a\u00f1adidura, etc. I have to press (shift) + (~) + (n). With time I got used to it and now I can flow when I type these words, but at first it can be annoying like I said.

First off, I specifically ordered a Google Chrome Book because I was, frankly, tired of anything Windows and I wanted to try something different. This notebook did not disappoint. It is, first and foremost, meant for the mobile user. It boots up in less than a minute, and shuts down even faster. Being from Google, it will use your Google username and password, so if you don't have a Google account set up at the time you order, I would suggest you set one up. Software runs very fast, files load just as fast, and saving happens in the blink of an eye. If you have an Android cell phone, you are able to update and/or download software from the Google Play Store, just like through your phone. For a small computer, it is surprisingly powerful and fast. I am very impressed with it. Sorry, Microsoft. You've been replaced."}]}
