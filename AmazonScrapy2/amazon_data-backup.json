I got this laptop because it didn't cut corners for the price. Acer was too ugly. Asus cheaped on their cooling solution and monitor. I notice ghosting on the monitor, but most people won't. It's not a big deal either. Best keyboard of any laptop. Especially for this thin. It's a really fluid laptop. Keep the power plan on balanced. Don't use the Lenovo suite program. Uninstall McAfee. Default Windows defender is fine. It's good now anyways. I got this for someone else, my laptop is a GS 65 stealth. A $2000 laptop. This is better built than that. It feels like a $800 laptop.

The battery life lasts a few hours on a full charge (about 5 hours, if I remember correctly) and the setup was fairly easy. This product does come with that S mode on it, but it was easily removed (a web window popped up on the website and allowed me to change it within a few seconds).

Wow! Perfect for travel and powerful enough to satisfy", "review_text": "I am a software developer who runs Linux Mint and cares a lot about battery life and portability. This machine does not disappoint. I love it! I would definitely recommend buying and installing more RAM, which is an upgrade I performed myself. You won't regret it.  If you're an avid gamer, I'd recommend sacrificing battery life, spend $300-400 more and get something with better graphics.  For the average person with a $500 budget, this laptop is amazing. Wow: - 8 hours of battery life (web browsing and doing day-to-day software development) - Great performance for the price point! The 10th generation i3 CPU is no joke! Whoa! Likes: - Nice, crisp display, especially for the price point - 1920x1080 display resolution -- a MUST for me.  How does anyone live with less? :) - Backlit keyboard (also a MUST for me) - Linux Mint 19.3 works out of the box - Good build quality. The aluminum on the back of the display is a clutch move -- A smart design decision that makes this thing feel more expensive. Well done, Acer! - Connectivity options are simple and complete - Lightweight - Quiet -- except when you're gaming or REALLY taxing the CPU... it gets loud, but not unbearable. Other reviewers say it's too loud, but I can't complain at all. Meh: - Needs more RAM -- but this is not a big problem.  A simple search on Amazon gets you 8 GB more RAM for under $40. Install is pretty easy; careful with the plastic. - Intel UHD Graphics 620 chip leaves more to be desired. Not recommended for avid gamers, but passable for everyone else. I play Minecraft, and it runs great at normal settings. - Trackpad - it's good, but it's not great - Charging plug seems to be rather vulnerable to damage if you aren't careful. Don't trip over a wire and pull this one out! It fits in there snugly, and pulling it out at an angle would probably be very bad. - Power / charge LEDs are located on the side out of PC, which I think is silly.  Also no numlock / capslock LEDs. - Keyboard is soft but passable.  Hmmm... that brings us to.... Dislikes: - Keyboard layout - Boo.  Most people won't care, but I don't like it.  Acer tried to squeeze in a number pad, and it's just awkward and awful. The number pad keys are just too small to be practically useful (sigh). They also omitted little things like a \"Home\" key, \"End\" page, and \"PgUp\" / \"PgDn\", which are technically on the number pad but behave differently on Linux terminals.  The up/down arrow keys are also weird and disproportional.  I also dislike the power button being a key on the keyboard, but that's just personal preference.  All that said, I've seen laptops with worse keyboard layouts, but this keyboard layout just kinda sucks.  It's a crying shame.  Oh!  And one more thing!  The F3 key is brightness down.  F4 key is brightness up.  The icons are confusing because at first glance it appears to be the other way around. Strong Dislikes: - None Overall: Great value for ~$450! Despite my rant on the poor keyboard layout, I'd buy it again."}, {"name": "Kent D.", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2020", "title": "I think I'm the first to review the 10th gen i3 model", "review_text": "First of all, 5/10, this is my overall score. I returned the machine because the laptop died on me after update's 3rd restart. For the time it was runing, the i3-10110u is pretty good. The S-mode is not a problem (which you can switch out of, just go to the microsoft store and you'll need a microsoft account to op out). The build of the laptop is decent, light, feels good when holding it, but not thin (or not as thin as ultrabook), this model still has the similar thickness compare to any other work-intended 15.6 laptops. The box came with an extra hdd holding rack for additional 2.5 disk if you want to upgrade, however the upgrade is not easy as the connect port for the 2.5 disk is hidden underneath the wifi-card which means you need to remvoe the wifi-card first to connect the 2.5 disk then put it back in. This could be a problem for any one that has no experience. There is on ram slot on the motherboard, but the motherboard comes with 4gb soldered already, and the slot supports up to 16gb (according to acer website) so the max ram you can get on this machine would be 20gb. The i3-10110u runs with 2666 mhz ram so 2400 would be limiting the cpu's perfomance. Although the specs are good, and out of box the laptop feels good as well, the laptop died about 3 hrs in, which i just finished updating the system. The laptop came with 1809 version and I was only able to update it to 1903 version which is weird (since the latest is 1909). After third restart, the laptop just went into repairing mode and couldn't reset because I had not made a backup (which you would not expect to do for a brand new laptop that's just 3hr in). I'd like to think this is a single case as my luck was just not there for this laptop. But I would suggest any one that's purchasing this model to have prime or equvilant protect so that if the same happens to you, you'll have my option, return."}, {"name": "TC", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2020", "title": "Nice laptop.

Great case design. 11 screws to slip the bottom off. Came off easy. Verifying the main board set up. This is the Icore3 Intel with 4gb ram and 128gb drive. This board has one ram slot. Important when ordering hence no 2 slot ram configurations would make any sense. Crucial has $80 16gb ddr4 which will bring system to 20gb ram. Love the hard drive chassis is in box. This will definitely need an additional hard drive. Easy to do. So when I booted everything was great. Impressive honestly for the price. Really impressed. So I ran the windows update. Everything goes good. The one major issue is the wireless network adapter continues to drop. Rebooted several times. At some points it would stay on a bit, but it dropped again. So I was disappointed, I know the network is solid. This was only 2 things. Bad hardware or outdated driver. After removing network hardware in device I hooked up to either cable. Ran another windows update. This update provided latest driver for intel wireless adapter. That was 2 hours of wasted time. So.

I was tempted to pay more for extra RAM and SSD capacity right out of the gate as both are pretty minimal in the package I bought. I opted to start with the more affordable purchase price and then see where I might need to boost capacity especially as I start using my DAW for more recordings with plugins. If I start to get bogged down I'll look into adding a single 12 or 16 gig RAM card to push speed for running the software and then possibly into increasing my basic SSD 126 gig memory by adding at least another 500 gig SSD which my machine does have space for inside. More money of course. Might end up looking back and wishing I'd just spend an extra $200-300 out of the gate and maybe even had a faster intel chip.

I did not want to get the limited chrome books the school provides as I believe others may have a bigger need for the. I initially tried to use all the computers, tablets, etc... that we already have, but it does not work well. As such, I purchased this  laptop for my 4th grader (9 years old) because it does all that she needs, it is not too expensive and it is sturdy enough for a 9 year old to handle. I received it very well packed in foam. The packaged contained the laptop and the power supply. The laptop battery was already fully charged, which was nice... Setting it up took about 20 minutes (as expected) but it was easy. I already had MS accounts for my daughter, so that was a breeze. The version of Windows installed is not Windows 10. It is Windows in S. However, upgrading it to Windows 10 is a very simple task that takes a reboot (which is what I have done). The keyboard is big enough to ensure you do not need a secondary (external) keyboard. The mouse pad is sensitive, and has the 2 clicking pads for the left and right clicks. There are plenty of  USB ports, HDMI and more. The battery lasts an easy 4 hours (37% left after 4 hours - not using maximum brightness in the screen). The camera has a good resolution for use with Zoom or MS Teams. I would not use this for me professionally, but it is a great laptop for a young kid in school (homework) or to play with Roblox...

The \"label\" that needs to be removed is much like a Lottery Scratch off. I used an X-acto knife and carefully scratched  just the top layer off of the label. If you peel too much, you will be calling Microsoft for assistance. When I get a new machine on work on, I use a direct connection to my router for speed. Once I have done all of the updates for Windows, I disconnect the network cable and go wireless. That went perfectly. This morning I did all of the Dell Bios and other Dell updates that needed to be done and all went flawlessly. So far so good..except for the camera issue that is still open.

Not a whole lot of information about this model on the internet, but I was curious myself to try out the new Ryzens and Vega chips. It\u2019s does just about everything a normal person would want a computer to do. Getting it out of S mode is literally a flick of a switch. Comes loaded with the normal crapware you expect from an off the shelf computer. It DOES have an unoccupied RAM slot, which I filled with an 8gig stick. What\u2019s curious, is it looks like there\u2019s an empty 2.5 inch bay, which I was going to fill with an SSD, however it doesn\u2019t have SATA cabling or connectors to hook it up. For reference, to get to the main board, you\u2019re going to have to peel off the sticky feet on the underside of the body. Despite my specific gripes, for $350 it\u2019s an excellent value and looks and feels like what I remember $700 laptops running like five years ago. In the age of a single USB-C port, having ethernet, USB-C, USB-A, and SD slots is very nice as well.

I immediately tried to solve the problem myself (looked into driver, adjust settings, etc), but none of it worked. I called Asurion with my protection plan and a technician kindly diagnosed the problem. It turns out that when this computer is plugged in to the AC adapter and charging, the current causes the mouse to jump all around if you use the touchpad. The second you unplug it, it works fine. I had purchased this computer for my children to \"go to school\" with. And while it does work fine when not plugged in, what do we do when we need to both use the computer and charge it at the same time? That seems like a pretty major glitch for a brand new computer.

However,  people who are not comfortable with installing a clean copy of Windows 10 (or upgrading the ram to 8 gigs) will be dissatisfied with this laptop. It has so much bloatware installed that the computer runs extremely slow. (I am talking turtle slow, go get a cup of coffee, make breakfast, and come back to find the computer is still thinking about doing what you are asking it to). Even just simple web surfing is annoyingly slow. There are two choices: either upgrade the ram to 8 gigs OR install a clean copy of Windows 10. You cannot uninstall the bloatware as it has been integrated into the installed Windows 10 operating system. These are your only two options with this laptop. Once I realized that I could not uninstall the annoying bloatware, I decided to completely format the hard drive and install a clean copy of Windows 10. Luckily I already had a copy of windows 10 so I didn't incur any additional costs. If you don't have a copy of windows 10 and don't want to purchase one, then your remaining option will be to upgrade the ram to 8 gigs. If you can do this yourself, it will cost about $40. If you take it somewhere for this to be done, you should plan on spending around $100-ish.

You are only allowed to use Microsoft approved apps from their store and do only Microsoft approved things. It is possible to upgrade to standard Windows 10 'home' (free) or 'pro'(purchase) but there is little reason to do so. This is simply not a game machine and surfing the net and watching movies you can do with the 's' system no problem. There is a builtin camera and microphone with their increased risk of 'loss of privacy'. On the face of it, you cannot enter the bios in order to install a different operating system. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE.  If you are computer savvy and go to lenovo's website and find the Lenovo manual for this specific laptop, and read it; you can change all of that. I am currently booting to, and running Linux Mint . This is exactly what I wanted; a cheap but modern laptop with Linux mint installed for general internet browsing and movies but without Microsoft telling me what I can and can't do or watching me do it. It's my wife's laptop and she is visually and physically impaired due to a stroke so no need for a game machine. The HD resolution is perfect for a screen of this size.

For starters, it takes less than 5 minutes to change it from Windows 10s mode to normal (You're even given a prompt as soon as the initial setup is complete), otherwise it's just a 10 second google search. For the specs, it can run any simple task like YouTube, email, word, etc. with ease. The system also comes with an SSD rather than a disk hard drive, making boot up much quicker. There are a few cons that do prevent it from being a 5 star product however. First, the battery life is relatively low, only getting around 2-3 hours doing light-medium work, so if you're going anywhere, make sure to bring the charger. Second, the mouse-pad is off center, which is bad for lefties like me (you're gonna have to buy a mouse or get used to the awkward positioning). Lastly, there is significant bloatware issues upon setup (McAfee, Lenovo apps, a billion Microsoft apps, etc.) making the computer slow at first, but once everything is uninstalled, it runs much smoother. Overall, it isn't a bad system at all. Many of the issues can be rectified with little to no money, and for it's price, I would definitely recommend it to people who want a college/business/recreational laptop, but do not want to break the bank. (note: for gaming, it can run simple games like minecraft, Roblox, LoL at 35-45 fps med-high settings. For more demanding titles, it is powerful enough to run a peer to peer gaming software like Parsec)"}, {"name": "Amazon Customer", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2019", "title": "Lenovo laptop bad laptop", "review_text": "I bought this item lenovo laptop on Jun 17, 2019, thelaptop will not turn on  a few months after that On Aufust 26, 2019, still covered under manufacturer warranty, the question is where do I send the laptop to get fixed?

The screen is fine and the keyboard has a nice feel, but it's not back-lighted. Webcam is fine for video chats and the touch pad is OK. In short, it's a good basic laptop and the price is right. Now we come to this AWFUL Windows 10 S mode. For those not familiar with S Mode: some new computers (including this one!) boot to S Mode when you turn them on for the first time. In Windows 10 S mode you cannot uninstall  anything from your new computer and you CANNOT install anything not made or pushed by Microsoft. Lets say you want to install you favorite web  browser. Not so fast! Windows in S Mode will tell you that you already have a wonderful Edge browser and will not let you install one of your choice. Most people do not like this S Mode and Microsoft says \"OK, switch to regular Windows 10.\" To do this just click here, then here and then here and that's it. Well, it took me half a day clicking \"here and here.\" I followed Microsoft instructions to the letter, but my new laptop stayed in S Mode. Then after probably 25 tries, it suddenly worked and it booted into normal, regular Windows 10 and it's fine now. So, you might be lucky and your new laptop will switch from S Mode to regular Windows right away, or you might have to fight with it, or maybe you'll like S Mode (I cannot imagine who would like it...)

Overall this has been a great purchase so far. Set up was super easy-- but I did have to switch out of S-mode right away, just to download my printer drivers. I cannot see the value in this mode since it seems so limiting to only select apps from the microsoft store. But it was easy to turn off, the computer even gave me a prompt to do so when I tried to download an unapproved application (my drivers). The CD drive/burner is the best part-- and why we selected this model. For my kids programs, this was a must. They have also loved burning music onto CDs-- we were doing this on Day 1. My only complaint is the screen. I knew it wouldn't be amazing since it wasn't full HD- so this was not a surprise to me. The contrast between blacks and whites is poor-- mostly the black just looks like dark grey. Not a deal breaker, but really the only negative I have. (and my kids don't care!) I would definitely buy this again and recommend for anyone using it in a similar way. I did not find the computer to be all that slow (especially working online- plenty fast, though loading new programs did take a few seconds) but my husband bought a single stick 8G memory to upgrade- so that is an affordable option if that is important to you.

I returned it because the network adapter is terrible in my environment.  After finding better options for the buck, I realize this computer is a poor investment for most people. Spending $400 for a computer with an I3 processor is not great.  I know it is fast enough for most tasks. The network adapter here is only single band, 2.4 Ghz, 802.11bgn.  This old, over-used standard is a foolish corner-cut by HP.  Even $100 android tablets now include 5 GHZ, 802.11ac WIFI.  With the older technology you are poorly equipped to fight for bandwidth in the increasingly congested WIFI environment.  In my neighborhood I got single digit MHz downloads with the CF0014DX:  OK for most web surfing, lousy for video streaming.  With an 802.11ac adapter I get 150 MHz to 200 MHz downloads \u2013 an astonishing improvement. The good news if you already own a laptop with 2.4 Ghz WIFI is you can easily upgrade with a USB WIFI dongle costing less than $15.  There are many options, I recently had success with this one:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07LFXN1SJ/ The CF0014DX computer only has two USB ports.  Having to buy a WIFI dongle for a new computer and fill up a precious USB port is unacceptable. The other impractical aspect of this package is that the SSD is only 128 GB.  It may seem passable for you today, but 256 GB is a realistic longer term minimum for most. I bought a better version of this computer for just $70 more: model  HP 14-cf0051od with 256 GB SSD.  Some listings show it having the older WIFI standard, but it certainly has an 802.11ac network adapter.  The processor is noticeably much faster; it will seem fast for several years longer than the CF0014DX. I see the Lenovo IdeaPad 530S 14\u201d, similar in specs to my HP 14-cf0051od,  on sale at big box for lower price.  It has advantage over the two HPs of higher res graphics and ability to upgrade RAM.  But no buyer\u2019s remorse here, I have long history with HP computers and am thrilled with my cf0051od. Buying a refurbished HP Elitebook or Dell Latitude on Amazon would also be a better value than the CF0014DX.  I am a big fan of buying refurbished desktop computers (sans monitor) because they can be upgraded easily.  I\u2019m shyer about refurbished laptops because they are more delicate; you can\u2019t just swap in new keyboard, mouse or monitor; many things can be wrong with them.  Take a risk on a refurbished laptop if you are fine with evaluating and potentially returning."}, {"name": "Amber Z", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2019", "title": "Excellent Laptop For the Price", "review_text": "I love this laptop. I am using it mainly for my school work, I do full time classes at university and some are online. I needed something light and fast that I could travel with. If you are looking for something that is a powerhouse laptop at this price point you are fooling yourself. I am surprised I got this good of a deal on a laptop with a SSD in it. I bought this laptop with the mindset that I wanted something that was fast and could do a light work load because I have a powerhouse gaming Desktop PC at home, so I did not need something over the top in a laptop. I also wanted it to be light for travel. If you are looking for something that will run High FPS Games or Adobe products smoothly I 100% don't recommend this PC. This computer can handle simple games, I like to play My Time at Portia and it can run League of Legends, but most potatoes can, so it's not a gaming PC by any means, but you need to check the Games themselves and see the lowest setting you can run them on (Like you should if you are a gamer and wanting a new laptop). The size of the SSD is not the greatest, so if you do not use things like Google doc's that save to the cloud you will be wanting to get an external drive or an SD card. I believe you can install a HDD on here, but am unsure and do not plan to myself. I have a 1TB external drive for if I need to move files between computers and as a general rule of just having my files backed up to several places. Pros: - Boots up in seconds - Runs smooth for everyday light use, Internet Browsing, Watching Youtube, Hulu, Netflix - Plays some games that don't need high graphics cards or processors - SD card slot so I can extend storage if need be - Has an Ethernet Port and a HDMI port if you travel and want to put something on the bad hotel TV's Cons: - The Bloatware, so dumb and useless - No others right now Again my review is based on this product at this price point. I didn't expect this PC to run a graphics intensive Game, I would never expect a 400$ laptop to do so. I love that it came with an SSD, the storage is fine for my needs as I mainly use Google Docs for school and have an external drive. I have had no issues with the Wi-fi on the laptop as of yet, I do not expect to. If you are looking for a laptop that will offer you speed and be a great travel companion if you are in college or travel for work, you should get this one.

Up to you, but the bloatware you will get with almost any new Laptop."}, {"name": "J. Meza", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2019", "title": "High value laptop", "review_text": "I'm really only using this laptop for three things -Internet browsing -word processing via (google docs) -emails *possibly light gaming such as hearthstone or solitaire/suduko For it's three main uses it functions very well. I mainly use this laptop for school. The 8gb of ram are plenty for my needs and the hard is ok which I'll get into. Connections -2 usb ports (one of them is a 2.0 and one of them is 3.0) however when you at the side of the laptop you cant tell which one is which cause they both look the same and the small guide that come with the laptop does not show you which is which, but that's ok for me. -1 headphone/mic combo jack -1 HDMI port (this is particularly good if you plan to mirror you screen to a television) -1 ethernet connection (RJ-45) this is the basic ethernet connector most people use -1 power adaptor port -1 usb C port -1 card reader (which I haven't used yet) -1 connector to hook up a locking cable for you laptop (I probably will never use this but cool feature anyways) After opening the box -I like that it is a very light weight laptop which is great for traveling and school -the keyboard feels fantastic (much better than my previous lenovo) -the track pad works well and if you look at one of my photos it has some special features that allow you to zoom in on the screen and use in a way similar to a smart phone (these features also apply to the touch screen version of this laptop but the laptop I am reviewing is not a touch screen) I personally prefer a laptop with out the touch screen feature -The description says that the hard drive is a 128 GB SSD. It is indeed a SSD but they maximum capacity is 118 GB and after OS installation, windows updates, and some basic apps, the storage left over is about 80 GB. This is ok for me. When you think about it 80 GB is still a lot of storage space, and I have a 1TB external hard drive that im using to store most of my files. Also If you prefer there are many ways to get free cloud storage such as dropbox or google drive. If you plan to store large videos and/or massive amounts of photos I would recommend getting and external hard drive. (keep in mind this laptop does have a card reader so you could also get yourself a some kind of sd card for storage space as well) Also this laptop comes in a 256 GB storage capacity, I'm guessing after the formalities it's closer to 225 GB. -The screen looks good. Its clear and bright (adjustable). great definition -The sound is ok. It really the same as you would expect for any laptop. I will be using my song headphone if I feel like getting better sound -There is a little fan that runs, but you will hardly notice it. -The laptop top does come with some bloat ware but you can sort that for your self or just keep. ( you might not even notice the difference) -The cold start time is about 8 seconds (that's really fast!) Things to Note -Don't buy the expert setup. Save yourself the 80 dollars and buy some accessories. The setup is simple and the laptop will walk you through the process (nothing major to do). All I did was plug in the laptop to an outlet, turned it on, and cortana walks you through the process. It only take about five minutes. Add another five minutes to run windows update and download/install the newest updates. It really is easy. -This laptop does not have a CD drive. It says so in the description on amazon. I'm just pointing it out for those who skipped straight to the review section. -If gaming is your biggest concern I would not suggest this laptop. It does have a decent processor and amount of ram, but it's more for general use and apps that consume less of your cpu power. -Amazon offers a warranty. You can get it if you want; that part is really up to you, and depends on how much abuse you think you might put your laptop through. If you're on the fence about the warranty, HP themselves offer a warranty that you can purchase after the fact when you setup the laptop for the first time. I believe it cost 80 dollars for three years. In conclusion If you feel like you identify with the student/worker/average person who needs a laptop for travel and general use, you can purchase this laptop knowing it will perform well for you. HP is a great brand and makes reliable computers. I would highly recommend this laptop for anyone who plans to use it for school."}, {"name": "Patrick Dalbec", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2019", "title": "Great Laptop for Price - first impression", "review_text": "I bought this laptop knowing it wouldn't be a powerhouse.

If you are looking for a \"Chromebook\", this machine is a little deceiving at first.  It comes with Microsoft Windows 10 operating system in \"S\" mode.

I think this is a good machine with a lot of potential, but I also think \"S mode\" is stupid.  It isn't safety and security that they are marketing with \"S-mode\", it's creating division and preventing free market apps unless you turn it off or elect to change operating systems.

Immediately upon opening the shipping box I noticed that it was labeled on the physical laptop that it ran windows 10 in S mode.

One can turn off S mode pretty easily but it negatively impacts the speed and performance of the laptop. The specs that the laptop advertises are generated when using S mode, so when turning off S mode, the qualifications the laptop sold you on, can be incorrect. I do not want this feature, and my problem is that this feature was not displayed accurately or, well, even at all on this store page.

That by itself wouldn't have warranted a review, but this laptop at the time of me writing this, is less than 24 hours old and I'm being notified during the boot sequence that a broken fan (90B) is being detected and continued use of the laptop will result in possible system failure (it will break the system). The fact that this laptop shipped broken, with an obvious fan issue, pushes me to attempt to get a refund.

So I got this Acer Chromebook CB3-532 as my first Chromebook. Very nice looking laptop with a 15.6 inch screen, fairly easy to set up with a fairly good picture quality. It has a built-in webcam with mic, SD card reader, 1 USB 3.0 port & 1 USB 2.0 port plus HDMI port. It has 2 gigabytes of memory, 16 drive & headphone/speaker jack.  It does not however have a CD/DVD player/burner.  I attached an external mouse to use on this Chromebook....it works just fine. Laptop seems slightly sluggish but not a major issue for me....yet.  I have had this Acer Chromebook for a month now & still a learning curve as I have been using Windows laptops for over 12 years now......so indeed a big learning curve for me. It has wifi connectivity & you cannot hard wire into the Internet with this Chromebook, just by wifi....which is fine for me. There are no real icons on the desktop of Chromebook. Whatever I used on my Windows 7 laptop & had desktop icons....I simply will have to funnel it through Chrome browser already on this laptop. Battery life seems good at currently 7 hour life on a full charge and for the most part, this nifty Chromebook should do fine for me . 4 stars I give this interesting Chromebook mostly because it's a new thing for me to learn, but similar to my Android Smartphone....so not too bad, no desktop icons like a Android smartphone however. Needless to say, a learning experience for me with this Chromebook...keyboard a bit lacking features compared to a Windows/Apple keyboard.

I've never had a Chromebook before but I have owned Windows, Apple, and Linux systems. I wanted to see just how useful it really is when used as a laptop replacement. I think a large percentage of the laptop community still has no freaking idea what chrome OS is. They were spoon fed Windows from birth. This review will make sense to the tech community, for the Win world - not so much. This Chromebook uses a somewhat customized version of Android operating system. My reading suggests about version 4.4. Before you let that dissuade you from getting one, it actually works quite well. The screen is not touch sensitive, but the track pad recognizes a two finger touch as a context menu - akin to a Windows right click. Access to the play store allowed me to quickly populate it with everything I needed to get through my day. I can work with zip,tar, and other compressed formats, and open almost any file I set my sights on. The one exception was a docx word file. My word processor only handled doc files. I could probably get around this by using the online version of MS Word but haven't tried that yet. Since tax season is coming up I tried three of the more popular online tax packages to see how they worked with it. I was able to work in TurboTax, Taxcut, and H&R block without any issues. The TurboTax version uses a very cool import to take a PDF copy of your W-2 and import and fill in all the fields. This worked flawlessly. I was also able to connect my wireless brother printer in a matter of minutes. This is kind of impressive for an older version of Android but by simply downloading the brother application for printers, I had set it up without hardly in any intervention from me. It just found it, like Win10 does with wireless printers.  This Chromebook comes with 32GB of storage but has the ability to use an SD card for an upgrade. I was able to upgrade it with an additional 256gb for no more than $65. the response time on applications was well within the margin of what you would expect for a normal laptop. Everything opened quickly and applications did what they were supposed to do without any hesitation. I will say that on first impressions, the plastic casing of the Chromebook looks kind of cheap. but then again it is kind of cheap at less than two hundred dollars you're not going to get a stainless steel case. This would make a perfect workbook to take on a plane and get some work done or something to just sit around and browse internet all day. The battery life is supposed to be at around 11 hours and from what I've seen so far it looks like it would make that. I was able to use it off and on pretty much all day and only used about 50% battery reserve. It is also less than 3 pounds. It's so light you can forget you have it with you. It also is not bad for watching movies on. I installed the Netflix app and streamed several hours of video with no drop outs. All said, I think this makes a good inexpensive all around computing device as long as you have generic tasks; watching videos, browsing, writing your book. If you don't need to compile code for your daytime job you will do fine."}, {"name": "THX1138", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2018", "title": "Samsung Chromebook - just what I needed", "review_text": "I purchased the 32-bit Samsung Chromebook 3.

I don't want to spend time dealing with my writing device, I want to turn it on and write, I want to turn it off and have my writing saved. I want it to check my spelling. The lack of a right mouse button or a scroll wheel will throw a lot of people at first, but if you see the charms in this little box you will be compelled to use the Googles and look up how to use a Chromebook mouse pad. It is worth learning and will simplify your life. You can install apps from Google Play, Youtube works super well, many apps will run including Microsoft Office. There are good apps and avenues to log in to a remote desktop either Linux or Windows. It isn't a gaming computer, and I wouldn't try to do heavy photoshop or other graphics on it.

My first was a refurbished one that I needed in an emergency that only lasted 3 months. My second was a previous Samsung model and it lasted me about 2.5-3 years. I have the same issues with this Chromebook as I do my last Samsung one: 1- The audio jack: the audio is incredibly static-y when using normal headphones. When using headphones I pretty much have to find some sort of white noise to play in the background to coverup the static, or use a bluetooth headset. It's incredibly aggravating at times. 2- The screen. I'm not sure if it's the way I store it in my bag or what, when the Chromebook is closed, it makes contact with the keyboard, and needs frequent cleanings. I'm not sure if it's that the back cover is too soft and pliable or what, but this is a common issue. Now, when I go to clean the screen, no matter how gentle I am, it's inevitable that I will get damages pixels in the screen. I replaced the screen in my previous Samsung Chromebook twice in the 2.5-3 years that I had it for, and on this one I can already see some spots that are becoming damaged. I was hoping with this later model that some of these issues would be improved on, but It doesn't look like it. For anyone who has a Chromebook, I would also recommend getting rid of the ChromeOS and making the switch to Linux's GalliumOS. It's definitely worth it, and will put that hardware to better use."}, {"name": "E.

It takes so long for the sites to load and then you can't scroll easily, keeps getting hung up. So I must do stuff like this on my phone instead. It's useless for even this simple function. For another thing. I'm trying to stream a movie. If you rewind or pause or do anything like that, it freezes, buffers forever. Even if you leave it alone and just let it play, it skips every few minutes. One last thing. My email is with yahoo. I know it's an old provider, but I don't want to change it- I've had it for years. The OS makes it extremely difficult to view my email or scroll through my messages. It has prompted me to download it into Drive and open it up that way, but if I wanted to use google for my email I'd do that. It annoys me that I must merge my yahoo mail with google rather than just being able to see it as if on any other computer I've ever used in my life.

I'm very pleased with it, as a web browser, and for writing. For me, it would not be powerful and flexible enough to be my only computer, but, it is really slick, for what it is. Performance is snappy, and the user experience is very good. You do have to learn some key combos to do navigation and such. There's a really nice keyboard map, accessed by pressing CTRL-ALT-?, ready for handy reference. The trackpad is very smooth. Battery life is around the advertised 8+ hours. Since I use the unit every day, and the suspend mode is pretty easy on battery use, I haven't even turned it off... just closed the lid so that it is instant-on when I open up again. With my use patterns, I've been charging every other day. I've heard the C720 described as ugly. I disagree. It may not be the height of elegance (yes, I was blown away when I first saw a Macbook Air), but, it is really decent. My only minor niggle is that the cover finish is a magnet for oily fingerprints. I didn't fully love the Chromebook until I found the Caret app. It is a multi-document text and code editor that truly works offline. Be advised that you may hear that Google Docs and some other included Chromebook \"apps\" can be used offline. My own experience, and that of many, many reviewers in the Google Play store, is that those claims are often not true, or only half true, at least for now. For example Google Play Books has an option to make your book titles available offline. All that seems to do is cache 10 or 12 pages ahead, and, it is those pages you could read offline. Now, there IS an option to download books in PDF format. That works, but, you will no longer be reading with the smooth experience of the Books app. I hear you can work on a Google Docs file offline if you begin it online, or some such. I have not seen this work, in practice. None of this is criticism of Acer, but of Google and maybe some app developers. If you expect to do work offline, be prepared to find apps that will really let you do that."}, {"name": "scottjl", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2014", "title": "Amazing value for the cost.", "review_text": "I read about this laptop on a linux forum and was a bit skeptical.

I then proceeded to swap out the SSD, remove the firmware lock screw and install Ubuntu (there's a great version on www.distroshare.com). A few hours later I had a very speedy, full-function Ubuntu Linux laptop. Light weight and with about 7 hours of battery time, this thing really can't be beat for the price. I guess you're taking a chance with the refurb draw, but my unit was in brand new condition and everything functions fine. Note, you can not install Windows on here, any version, so don't bother trying, there are no drivers for the keyboard and mouse. If you want a low-cost, light weight, long battery life Linux laptop for web, lightweight development, and general purpose, this is a great fit. I definitely recommend this laptop with this in mind.

Also, even though it is refurbished, Google still gave me the free 100GB of storage for 2 years.

Even more amazing as a Linux laptop. I purchased refurbished on Amazon and I have to say, it was worth every penny! Item is in excellent condition, came in a plain box with the charger. No additional documentation or waste, very minimal packaging. Nothing unexpected. Good stuff. I have a confession to make; I used to avoid Celeron processors like the plague. The 2955U Intel Haswell processor used here is quite speedy and has changed my view on Celerons completely. You will not be disappointed. Day-to-day performance has been excellent; this can play 1080P HD video and multitask without any hiccups. Forget ARM processors (too slow), forget the Core i3 model (offers minor improvement); this is where it's at. The 4GB of RAM I feel definitely kicks it up a notch and helps any overall operating system handle better. The SSD is fast and very responsive, even for a small size of 16GB. After repartitioning for a Linux install, I had around 4GB to play around with after installing all of my essentials, even after including updates. For any of those who are wondering, the SSD is upgradable, but the RAM is soldered in. This laptop is great on power / battery life, and has never gotten warm except when charging under intensive use; very lap friendly. WiFi and Bluetooth are great and have had no problems. The 720p webcam is good as well and the design is simple and stylish in grey. Easy to take apart and put back together, as it uses standard screws, all of which are located on the bottom of the unit itself. Minor gripes. The screen is subpar and isn't the sharpest or best quality. It's got a bright backlight, but the color representation is not as saturated. Another thing is that the keyboard feels kinda plastic / cheap in my opinion. It feels lighter than usual to me, but that's pretty much it. Not really much to complain about, that I won't even take away a star. Overall, this is an amazing little machine for the price. Chrome OS is pretty basic, as to be expected. However, I've purchased with the exclusive purpose of installing Linux in mind. Linux has now opened up a world of possibilities with using this device, including using Skype! If you're thinking about purchasing this to hack and put Linux on it, I would highly recommend the 4GB RAM option to anyone.

But this one in particular arrived and the trackpad didn't work. It was all jumpy and completely unusable. Another thing I didn't see in the description before I bought it was the fact that these are at the end of their \"life\" and there is no more software support or updates for it. So you get what you get and you're stuck with it because Google is no longer providing updates for this version. Needless to say, I am returning it and buying a new one.

I bought a model marked as \"Fair,\" so I was expecting some dings.  The caps button doesn't work, but the shift button is easy enough to use instead.  There are some scratches on the body of the laptop, but nothing on the screen or touchpad so it really doesn't effect how the laptop works.  Very lightweight and easy to take places.  It's a very basic, simple laptop that is great if you just want something to work on Google Docs and maybe surf the internet with.  It seems to be holding a charge well, and it was easy to customize the settings on it.  Overall, thus far, it seems to be a really good deal for what you get.

After winning your prize, you went home and realized that it was still not a good deal.  This laptop is almost in that category, though the build quality keeps it above water. It is important to start by discussing Windows 10 S.  It is a very restricted version of Windows 10 that allows only official apps to be installed, like the Edge web browser and Microsoft Office, plus restricts some multitasking.  There are different reasons for it to exist, including corporate/business use, to prevent unauthorized apps and avoid viruses.  It is also reportedly aimed at low end devices, being a lightweight version of the operating system more in line with a Chromebook.  This was my first experience with it, so I went in with an open mind... Everything seemed laggy and slow.  Isn't Windows 10 S supposed to be fast?  Sometimes a new computer is downloading and installing updates in the background, which makes it feel slow.  I checked and the computer was up to date.  The internet on my home Wifi, which works fine for everything else, was spotty.  The web browser would sometimes work slowly and other times not at all.  I quickly realized, also, that nearly everything I do on a computer is not accessible in Windows 10 S.  I browse the web in the Brave browser, which I couldn't install.  I watch movies in VLC.  So, I decided to \"upgrade\" to standard Windows 10 home, which is free, but the page for that kept stalling out. After giving the laptop a day off and taking it to work to try a different network on the older band (802.11g), Windows successfully switched off of S mode.  Annoyingly, I was required to use a Microsoft account to do that.  I checked and suddenly there were a ton of updates that I could install.  After doing so, the laptop was 500% faster, even if it was still on the slower side.  It also worked fine on my home network.  Do not believe the warnings that pop up about it slowing the computer down to switch.  I also went into power settings and turned off GPU throttling, which is a trick hardware makers play to give better battery life estimates at the cost of performance.  After downloading my preferred browser and software, I was able to browse the web and stream video fine.  I tried using the HDMI port, but it would not allow me to use the monitor.  Some glitch seems to happen, which may be related to the monitor having HDR support.  Normally, a computer that does not support HDR will just output non-HDR and it will work fine, but something strange was happening with the settings vanishing.  When that failed after a lot of tinkering, I tried Miracast (wireless display casting) and that actually worked with just a little lag, but it cuts out after maybe 20 minutes each time. The screen is very outdated.  Apart from the lower resolution, which I can live with, the viewing angles require very direct aiming of the screen at the viewer.  If I try to look at the screen when I am standing up, it looks all washed out.  Coming out in 2019, this is not acceptable on even a cheap laptop. Overall build quality, for the low price, is not bad at all.  It has a business laptop look that is not offensive and is more sturdy than some in this price range.  The charger is the traditional block type rather than the handy USB-C.  There are no USB-C ports at all. As many faults as this laptop has, it could be worth purchasing at a very low price, rather than the current pretty low price.  If you just need some light browsing (not on a monitor or a good screen) and can deal with the headaches of the OS, I could see it having merit."}, {"name": "Angela J Brouse", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2019", "title": "FAILURE", "review_text": "ORDERED THIS ITEM 10NOV2019  ARRIVED NEXT DAY SET IT UP SHORTLY AFTER ...

I wanted a no-frills, cheapish machine that would be able to run Microsoft Word, a few tabs in a browser, and some very light programming and CAD work. This laptop is able to do so, but only by the skin of its teeth.  It must be noted that it comes with Windows S, a locked operating system somewhat reminiscent of Chrome OS, where non-certified apps are restricted, and the laptop's performance is thus protected from strain.  The moment I had the laptop set up, I reverted it to normal Windows 10 Home and that is when the seams started to show. From startup to shut down, no matter what I am asking of the CPU, the Intel Celeron N4000 remains at 100% load.  It is chugging\u2026one hundred percent of the time.  RAM usage sits at around 80%, regardless of task or program in use.  There are noticeable delays when trying to open programs or browser tabs, forget CAD work.  This may be partially my fault, since the laptop is designed for a Windows S environment, but an outdated CPU tied to 4 GB of RAM will always struggle, regardless of the environment.  HP may have tried to alleviate this by giving the laptop a very low-quality screen, where even normal text is often slightly pixelated. The 64 eMMC storage is fine\u2026if you are using some cloud service for the majority of your storage (the laptop comes with one year of 1 TB of OneDrive storage).  Don\u2019t expect to store movies or install many programs on this laptop. A mark in this laptop's favor is the three USB-A ports, one of which is USB 2.0 and the other two of which are 3.1 Gen 1.  It also has a full-sized HDMI port, which I have already used many times in the office.  It has no USB-C port, unlike most modern laptops, but, somewhat hilariously, neither does a single projector or TV in my office.  For better or for worse, they all still have HDMI cords and I have been asked many times to use my underpowered laptop over co-workers modern workhorses simply because of that HDMI port! I don\u2019t mind this laptop, with its huge bezels, bad camera, and outdated Wi-Fi antenna.  I have had to drastically change my expectations, but I never worry about it getting beat up on my commute or damaged when I drop my backpack to the ground. It does what I ask of it, barely, and that is just fine.  Oh, and it will be the laptop I take with me on my next overseas project.  If it gets destroyed or lost...

For the price it was adequate, but looked childish and was housed in aqua blue plastic. It worked fine, not a huge amount of power, and was fairly slow, but I figured for the low price, was good enough to start out with it. The difference between that model and this one is immense. This one, looks like a business laptop, it\u2019s super lightweight and even though it has only 4GB of Ram, it\u2019s fast enough. This is also the perfect Laptop for my retired Husband who really doesn\u2019t do much computing. He sends the odd Email, checks sports scores, may stream a rare Netflix show, and plays solitaire. He also spills drinks into expensive laptop keyboards, and renders them \u201cfried\u201d.

My usage for this is 70% regular computer work (business, light Photoshop, web browsing, etc.) and 30% gaming when I travel as I have a full size gaming rig at home. I bought the  FX505DU, which has the 3750H and the 1660ti. I like the form factor and aesthetics of the device, it doesn't have much flex or \"creakiness\" to it, and it looks great sitting on a desk. The RGB keyboard is a great touch, but wouldn't allow me to change the color until I downloaded an extra piece of software. It cycles through all the colors by default. Other than that everything worked right out of the box and the performance has been very good. The 1660ti is a beast and has destroyed anything and everything I've thrown at it in 1080p. The 3750H cpu has been good as well, though as expected with Ryzen in some CPU intensive games it gets more than it can handle. Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a great example. I can play at ultra at 1080p with a locked 30FPS framerate, but if I attempt to get a steady 60fps on any settings, including the lowest, there's just too much going on and it can't do it, even with plenty of GPU headroom. Athens just melts it. Having said that Athens pushes my desktop 9900k, so I don't consider it a negative, just something to keep in mind if you're wanting 1080p60 on everything. The only other games I've tested so far are: The Witcher 3: Steady 60fps on ultra (had to dial back one setting, \"foliage\" to high, and no hairworks). Great experience. Doom 2016: All ultra locked 60 fps using less than 50% of the GPU and CPU. This title can play at 100fps, but it gets too choppy in some high intensity spots, so I lock it to 60 for a smoother experience. Thermals are great, GPU never exceeded 71c at 100% usage, no throttling that i was aware of. Make sure fans are on Turbo, which can be done with a touch of a button on the keyboard, which is awesome. The noise levels during normal usage are fairly quiet, and I appreciate that it has a silent fan setting that can dial things back in case you don't want to let everyone in the classroom or office know you're rocking a gaming rig. Noise levels during gaming were loud, but I've certainly heard much worse from other gaming laptops. I also appreciate that the top of the laptop doesn't get hot, even after prolonged gaming sessions, so you can rest your hands on the keyboard without discomfort. The screen is decent, nothing amazing, but perfectly serviceable, especially considering the price. The 120hz refresh rate is nice for regular usage, but in gaming I've found that the CPU can't get many games past 80-90fps before hitting it's limit, so I've been staying with a locked 60. Also be aware this screen doesn't have any type of adaptive refresh rate (Freesync/Gysnc) so make sure to use Vsync and a frame rate limiter if you want locked frame rates as very few newer games can hit the native 120. This model comes with 2 drives, an SSD and a mechanical hdd. I replaced the hdd with a Samsung Evo ssd, and it took about 5 minutes. The entire bottom comes off the machine after removing all the bottom screws and carefully popping the bottom panel off. I recommend using a plastic separator tool to avoid damage, the tabs were a bit too snug to pop off with just fingers. You also have access to the fans and ram in case you ever need to service and/or clean the dust out. Other than McAfee there isn't much bloatware and the preloaded Asus apps work fairly well. The keyboard and track pad are both comfy and work well. The track pad may turn some people off because it doesn't have separate left/right buttons, but it's large and responsive which is all that I look for. Overall I'm very satisfied with this laptop. It looks great, performs very well, especially considering the price, and feels very durable. My one criticism is the lack of adaptive refresh rate tech, but at this price point that's wishful thinking.

The laptop overall is very fast. The NVME OS drive was able to transfer at over 950 MB/s. Not as great as a Samsung NVME, but still better than a SATA SSD. The secondary D: drive was 1tb, and it's performance was abysmal. It would only write to the drive at 40 MB/s. The dual fans werent overwhelmingly loud when gaming, however they are still running at over 2500 rpm even when the system is idling. Farcry 5 was able to run at over 60 fps on max settings. The reason why I ended up returning this laptop is because of the terrible battery life. I understand that if I'm gaming or using a moderate amount of CPU that the battery life would be terrible. I turned all settings to maximum battery life, both in the asus software, and in the control panel's power settings. I dimmed the display to minimum, and set the refresh rate to 48hz. I used device manager and disabled the GTX1660. The keyboard LEDs were turned off. Wifi was on and connected by itself to a mobile hotspot. The laptop was idling with no apps open and just sitting at the desktop. It was using the minimum amount of power that I could set it at. The battery lasted 1 hour, 15 minutes from 100 percent to 5 percent. Using a kill-a-watt, this laptop was using 50 watts while idling. This is why the laptop's battery was unable to keep up. While playing Farcry 5, the kill-a-watt showed the laptop was using 130 watts.  This is basically a desktop computer with a built in UPS.

Noise: It stays pretty cool and quiet even in its loudest mode called turbo. Balanced is completely silent and still decently fast. 2. Display: Although small the display is pretty sharp and a nice 120hz. I do wish it had GSync but overall you cant get everything for this great of a price. 3. Speed: This thing is quite the monster, its fast with the 1660ti. Im quite impressed by it. Cons: 1. Silent mode: There is a mode called silent mode, In my opinion I think that mode is unusable. Its too slow for me. I bet it is good when you are trying to save battery life. 2. Now that leads into the next con, battery life. It seems it only lasts around 1 and a half hours even in balanced mode. Maybe im wrong about that but it seems very short. Edit: This has been fixed since this review. ASUS was very quick to bugfix it and I am impressed. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. Sleep mode: Sometimes when I close the laptop and try to open it back up the display doesnt start up again.

I prepared for the transition from my 6.5 year old Samsung and had everything backed up on a USB flash drive. I made lots of notes of things to do in order when I received it. Mind you, I'm a 66 year old lady and not in the best of health but I've always been good with setting things up. Well, it arrived on July 8th after ordering it on July 5th. Gotta love Amazon Prime. I've had it now for nearly two days and everything has gone very smoothly. Loved it when a windows update came through and updated my bios to 305! PROS: -The keyboard is great and I love the 1 zone RGB. It's pretty easy to change the lighting settings in Armoury Crate after an auto update of ROG Live Service came through. -This laptop is fast and very responsive though it takes awhile getting it there so make sure you go through the Windows 10 settings with an fine toothed comb. -Noise levels are not noticable at all until you get to Turbo but even at that level it's not that loud. Love that you can easily change the fan modes on the keyboard by pressing FN + F5. -Thermals. Ok, I'm not a heavy duty gamer, but I do occasionally play a 15 year old game called Lineage II. No probems whatsoever and temps didn't get above 58c. Even while having 10 browser windows open in Firefox. -This FX505DU is solidly built.

The CPU and GPU in this laptop have been fantastic for my use case (Fusion 360, ZBrush, Blender, and all the games I care to throw at it), but the 48Wh battery in this means you'll likely only want this if you only plan to have this plugged in most of the time, because that two hours I mentioned earlier is going to look a lot more like one hour or less when you start driving the CPU/GPU hard. Worth mentioning, btw, the battery is fairly easy to swap if you ever find the need after the warranty runs out. No way of knowing what kind of availability we'll see for replacements after this is EoL'd, but if they're available whenever that day comes, it's just a matter of unplugging the battery, removing a couple retaining screws, and gently lifting it out. Unlike some devices, the battery in this laptop isn't held down with a giant mess of glue, so this has the potential to have a very long service life without being a pain to DIY repair. Gaming performance: You'll have to make sacrifices in most titles from the past few years to get this to hold 120FPS at 1080p, but those sacrifices are usually pretty minor (AA isn't that big a deal at this screen size), and if I can't hit 120, I have yet to find any game that didn't get some approximation of 60FPS with the settings maxed or some hard-to-notice sacrifices in quality. I am extremely satisfied with the oomph this thing brings. As a kinda average example, I was almost always seeing 120FPS in Destiny 2 before I just had to go in and screw things up by deviating from the auto settings. As for build quality, this thing is... well, kinda tough. Can't say I've been tossing it around like a frisbee to really test it, but the screen is decently reinforced and has only a reasonable amount of flex, the hinges are solid and stay exactly where you tell them to stay, and the plastic used in the lower housing feels like either ABS or PA6. I'm not about to put this under the knife to check for any fiber reinforcement, but I at least found it had a healthy amount of give to it when I opened it up to swap the HDD for an SSD. It'd probably handle an impact about as well as a laptop this size can. Noise: Odds are, unless you're doing light tasks or playing older games that the IGP can handle on its own, you're going to have fan noise. Some games, like World of Warcraft, are happy with a warm potato pushing pixels, so you can put the laptop in silent mode and actually enjoy silence. In situations where you have a high GPU load but nothing taxing the CPU, silent mode's a little less silent due to the GPU having its own fan, but I still found it bearable. Balanced is where you'll probably be most of the time, and while I can tell the machine's running on the other side of the room, it's not quite a jet engine. \"Turbo\" mode, at least until the hardware becomes questionably relevant, is more of a \"hold my beer\" mode, and is perfect for that jet turbine ambience, but a little dubious as a daily power mode. Thankfully, you can swap between all three of those using a function key. I've also noticed that the power mode does have some influence over download speed on fast connections, but downloading a few gigs on silent mode still wasn't a terrible experience. RGB: Lastly, if you have this laptop or are about to have it, you'll need to go into the device tab in Armoury Crate to change lighting settings on the keyboard. Just mentioning it here because I spent a dog's age trying to figure out why the Aura tab was only making my keyboard flash for a second before going back to rainbow puke mode. Btw, if rainbow puke's more your speed, it's the default, and it's quite vibrant, so you'll be happy with that right out of the box. It does flicker a little between some color transitions, but it wasn't any worse than most of the other devices I've seen with a color-cycle mode."}, {"name": "DesuIsSparta", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2019", "title": "This laptop is a beast, but has some serious issues", "review_text": "(8/1/19)** I can't handle this laptop anymore. It's running like trash the more I use it. Temperatures are OK (not too hot, not as cool as they should be). Everything keeps turning black. Likely a GPU failure or a bad cpu/gpu combo (amd / nvidia aren't common). I'm past my return window so now I'll just have to find someone to sell it to. Very disappointed in this company. They won't even respond to our reviews. (7/21/19) ** I bought this laptop primarily for programming and heavy projects which require a lot of RAM, processing power, and even graphics processing power. For the price and the specs, it looked incredible. The day I got it, I started encountering some issues but I figured that I juts needed to install some updates and what-not. But now a month in since my initial purchase, I am still encountering some of the same issues. I'll skip over the tiny ones because I'm sure they'll be fixed in an upcoming update. The biggest issue I have with this laptop is that for some reason, it can not handle browser media well. What I mean by this, is if you are using a web browser like Chrome and try to play a YouTube video or a video which is otherwise embedded (whether it be HTML5 or Flash), it may have issues. In my experience, the whole screen turns black, and sometimes it fixes itself.. but often times, it does not. The issue is so bad sometimes, in fact, that the computer becomes completely unresponsive and you have to force power it down by holding the power button. Other times, it's just annoying that it renders black or green boxes all over the place. Almost looks like a sign of a failing graphics card, but every graphics test I've done has worked out well. This issue absolutely makes the laptop unusable. Another issue is that the touchpad is really strange. If your hands aren't completely 100% dry, the touchpad will not respond well at all. I've tried adjusting the sensitivity options, but they don't really help. The cursor will skip all around. I would think that most people purchasing this laptop will be using a mouse, but I prefer to not carry an extra peripheral with me to meetings. Minor thing, not really an issue.. There is no way to change the color of the backlit keyboard as of the time I'm writing this review. It's either on or off. It seems absurd to me that the keyboard is RGB but you can't set it to be a single color. It looks ridiculous when I want to have a white or blue backlighting but all I can get is the full rainbow spectrum. I tried installing Aura but it froze the computer every single time on startup and I had to restore the operating system to a previous point just to get it to work again. Also the function keys randomly decide when they want to work. I found that after the computer starts up or wakes up, it takes about 2 or 3 full minutes before the function keys begin to work. Sometimes even longer after sleep mode, to around 4 or 5 minutes. Negative stuff aside, I really do love this laptop and I just wish it would work  like it's supposed to. It's light, slick, has room for expandable memory, and will hold up well with its processing and graphics power.. if they can become a bit more compatible with each other. It doesn't look crazy like those other 'gaming' laptops where they're full of accented colors and flashing lights everywhere. If the issues I mentioned could be fixed, I would easily give this laptop 5 stars. But until then, it's really borderline 3 for me. Do you know what it's like to try and show your boss a video and have your laptop freeze up or stop working? It's embarassing.

I hate it I hate it I hate it, I hate it. I have a computer science degree, but I can't figure out how to make the keyboard lights stop doing that flashing rainbow effect that it does by default. Everything I've researched has pointed to downloading some Aura software and then I can fiddle with the light settings, so that's what I did. Except the software won't even start for me, and the internet consensus is just \"yeah, the software sucks, nobody knows how to fix it.\" I've spent two evenings trying to get these lights to just have one, static, unchanging color, and I'm stumped. I'd rather spend time with my family but I've been busy updating BIOSes and uninstalling/reinstalling software and scouring forums for answers, and I have nothing to show for it. And the mousepad, oh lawd the mousepad. I'm watching the mouse cursor dance all over my screen as I type this review because the base of my thumb keeps rubbing the mousepad. There's no quick way to turn the mousepad off, so... I just gotta deal with it. Hopefully I don't accidentally click something while I'm typing this! And my bigger gripe with the mousepad is how the bottom half feels so... cheap. Like it's about to pop out. The top half is solid and nice, but as soon as you get to the bottom you gotta deal with it having some play. It's segregated into two halves like there's a left-button and a right-button, but the \"buttons\" are touch-sensitive anyway, making it redundant and useless. If you actually DO want to \"click\" the buttons, good luck; your mouse pointer will move as you press into the mousepad, making you miss whatever you were hovering over. You probably think those two gripes are stupid and miss the point of a gaming laptop entirely. \"But does this laptop run games well??\" Yeah, I played some Far Cry and it ran great. But I want to do other things with this computer, and like it or not, literally everything else involves interacting with the distractingly-colorful keyboard and the fidgety mousepad. This machine isn't cheap, and after paying a cool grand for it, I'd expect more attention to detail. \"But why don't you just contact support?\" Haha! How? \"Asus support\" is an oxymoron. Just like I'm a moron for waiting too long to return this laptop. I hate it. I wish I could get a refund, but I thought I could figure out this keyboard light issue and get used to the mousepad, but I can't.

I'm going to compare this laptop with my old one (Acer Nitro 5 2017) Aside of better graphics and newer Intel, it's pretty lightweight compare to the Nitro 5. A little to the downside is that it doesn't come with a lot of ports on the side (3 USB ports) (1 audio jack) (1 HDMI and Wlan port). All on the left side, right side does not have anything. The Nitro 5 has a C-USB port and a SD Card port. It doesn't heat that much, I played Apex and League of Legends and it's pretty smooth. The gpu is Nvidia 1660 Ti. Apex settings in all high. Continuing my comparison with the Nitro 5, the Asus doesn't have a keyboard shortcut to pause, play next, play before, pause key for the music, a little bit awkward if you're playing and listening music and you want to go to the next song.

Can you go into bios and swap to the 1660Ti? Nope. In order to use the 1660Ti video card, you have to go into each app/game manually and make the 1660Ti the default video. (If you didn't know any better, you would be paying for more than you're using.) Once you figure out to make the 1660Ti the default video card for the app/game, do you get that app/game in 120hz? NOPE! The onboard video manages the display at 60hz. So your game may be telling you you're getting 200FPS, but you're display isn't putting it out. So either way, you wasted money. 2nd- The laptop comes with a flashing backlit keyboard, but no buttons or software to change to a solid color. So I have to sit here and stare at it. Personal problem to me because I want a solid color. Close the lid and open the lid, then who knows what you get. It may be a solid color you don't want, but usually it is flashing. No rhyme or reason to fixing the keyboard lighting. 3rd- The mouse pad feels very cheap. Like it is loosely fitted. I had to get a usb mouse to use because I found it to be so aggravating. There are a few more issues I have had to fix, but the bottom line is I expected much more from the supposed leader in gaming hardware. My next job is to scour the internet looking for fixes to clean up what Asus should have done before this thing left the factory. Very disappointed. (This is not my first Asus laptop but could be my last.) Bottom line, don't buy this unless you know how to fix it to get what you paid for. And without a proper bios fix, you will not get the 120hz monitor you're paying for. So best thing is to just move on to another product. *update* Gave up on this laptop.

While this laptop is very sleek looking and lightweight compared to my 9 year old still running Toshiba, it definitely has minor issues that need to be worked on. One being the battery of less than 1.5 hours, I have never had a laptop with this low amount of battery that even the best battery setting is horrible. On another note, I had had a few issues since I first received the laptop such as: black screening and even white screening while watching youtube videos and switching tabs to another video, constant Blue Screens of Death within the first few weeks(still happening) likely because of outdated drivers that wouldn't properly update or even install..or just bad incompatible parts put together, and SO many non responsive on my apps and games that the framerate drops. I got so fed up with the slow loading for my apps that I ended up reseting the laptop only to have it still as slow and horrible as before. Switching between two open and used tabs should't take 3 seconds for it to open each tab. Nor should it not be able to even fully run (java)minecraft of all things.

I plugged it into my monitor, plugged a keyboard and mouse in, and downloaded the Resident Evil 2 remake. This laptop will run the game on high settings, however the fans will be very loud and the CPU will be working very hard. I just want to mention this as a sort of rough benchmark, though we'll get into more specifics in just a minute. First, let's look at the pro's and con's of this laptop. Now, just to get a subjective opinion out of the way, I do not take my laptop out of the house very often. That being said, there's no reason why I wouldn't. It weighs roughly 5 pounds which doesn't really seem too heavy to me, but obviously you be your own judge. Pro's: * Has played everything I've thrown at it * Apparently can run Linux (I run Linux, you can run whatever you want) * The keyboard is I believe a chiclet keyboard, but honestly it's one of the best feeling chiclet keyboards I've used in recent memory * The screen has a solid 120 hertz refresh rate and some pretty decent viewing angles for the price. I will say that there are some bright spots, which might bug some people, but I don't mind them so much. * Build quality is something I look for in all of my laptops, and this one was obviously no exception. The body is all plastic, but it's a solid feeling plastic that's kind of rigid and doesn't flex much but also doesn't feel brittle. * The hinge is actually also very sturdy. I did not think this would be the case, and worried about the amount of closing/opening it would have to endure. After a few months, I'm happy to report that it feels no different than when I first bought it. Again, only 2 months at this point, but I've had more expensive laptops break in less time. I'll call it a positive. Con's: * Look, the touchpad just sucks. If you plan on using this touchpad for any kind of serious work, just get a mouse. It's finicky, often deciding that I have a ghost finger touching in the opposite place as my finger, or that the three clicks I just did were all right clicks. Frankly, it's kind of a headache, but I mean a mouse is better anyway. * The battery life is pretty mediocre for a normal, business class laptop and downright abysmal when you're gaming. Think 2 hours of Resident Evil before you have to think about how much progress you're going to lose in the next 15-20 minutes. Leave it plugged in for intense gaming, surfing the web and watching youtube will get you about 4-5 hours, depending on your settings. * This laptop only comes with the 256gb nvme flash memory. This is great as a boot drive and pretty much nothing else. It does not come with a hard drive by traditional standards, and the space provided is not enough for any kind of gaming library. You'll likely want to get a 1tb hard drive or SSD, that should hold most of your stuff. Or get a different size, I'm not your mom. * I/O is not great. All of the ports on this laptop are on the left hand side of the laptop, meaning that there are not very many of them, and yet they still feel kind of cramped. In total, there are three usb ports (1 of which is USB 2.0, the other two are USB 3.0) an HDMI port, an Ethernet port, the charging port, and a headphone jack. There is no card reader, no thunderbolt, no USB-c. On the other side of the laptop you'll find a kensington lock, for all of your kensington purposes. I just kind of feel like they could have put in a card reader and maybe another USB or HDMI on the other side, but it doesn't bug me too much. * Finally, and this is more a gripe about the current state of windows as a whole, but this laptop does come with a fair amount of bloatware. I randomly find things like Bejewelled or Fruit Ninja and their lookalikes downloaded on my boot drive. Thank Linus for Linux, yikes. Now something that I do want to address, this CPU (Ryzen 5 R5-3550h with Vega 8 IGPU) is not the toughest CPU out there. It's comparable to some of the low end i5's that Intel has been putting out, but it does only have a base clock speed of 2.1 GHZ and a boosted clock speed of 3.7 GHZ. This means that the CPU does sometimes get very hot for what seems like lower quality games, but the reality is that those games may be more CPU intensive. A good example I found was Terraria. It runs fine, but not when I was doing five other things in the background. Just some food for thought, it hasn't really impacted my feeling about this laptop, but you should know what you're getting before you get it. Finally, I want to mention the Armoury Crate program that is shipped with ROG and TUF laptops from Asus. I personally really like the interface, and it's one of few thing's I'll miss when I switch to Linux. It really does give you all of the real time performance info you need, as well as allowing you to control certain effects for your keyboard or what GPU will be used. You can also buy devices that link to your laptop and use the same RGB effects (For all you REAL gamers out there.) To sum this whole thing up, I was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't really expecting the build quality to be great, I wasn't expecting a really good keyboard, and I wasn't really expecting to be able to throw Linux on here. Lots of good surprises, not many bad ones. The touchpad sucks, but this IS still a budget laptop. I would and have recommended this laptop to friends and family alike, and am excited to see how long I can run modern titles with this lovely machine. I don't want to say \"Get this NOW!!!!\" or anything, but I did a lot of shopping and found nothing better for the price, so take that how you want to. Thanks for reading!

It's the first gaming laptop I buy in years so I was really happy to have found an AMD Ryzen system as my last gaming desktop was also an AMD system and it was amazing. Ordered this for a trip so I could relax and game while on vacation. I wish I had had the time to test it at home because it proved to be frustrating. My unit gets incredibly hot. I don't even have to be gaming for it to get uncomfortably hot. While on vacation, I had to buy a small laptop table just to use it because it would burn my legs. I tried everything, including setting the fans on turbo at all times. It's loud and that seems to help but as soon as I start gaming, 15 minutes into whatever game I'm playing, frame rates begin dipping and the game will freeze because the laptop is getting so hot. I I installed an app that measures the CPU and GPU temps and overlays those values while I play and my unit's GPU is routinely hitting over 90C. From everything I've read, that's too hot and it shows in performance. The battery is also awful. I have to be plugged in all the time or else I'm out of battery within an hour. It makes using the laptop while being mobile a pain because I have to be near a wall socket to plug in the charger. Basically I can't use the laptop anywhere I want, I always have to be plugged in and near a wall to do it. The WiFi is awful, too. Very slow. I've updated everything, via both the manufacturer website as well as Windows updates. The BIOS also updated and the WiFi is very slow. I can test the speeds using other wireless devices to check if it's my internet and our connection is fine. My connection at my home routinely hits 90 to 100 MPS. But this laptop will show me speeds of 15 to 25 MPS on the same connection. I don't know if the motherboard is the issue or what. And today my screen went black while using it and wouldn't turn back on for a few minutes. Then, on its own, it turned back on. Thats enough for me to make the decision to return it. I'm still within my return window so I'm going to go ahead and issue the return now and look into another model. It's a shame because I've got two Asus vivobooks for productivity and Netflix watching and they are excellent so I had the same expectation of excellence with this laptop.

PROS: The specs. Seriously. Find a better deal for a non-sale laptop of similar size. If you do, go out and buy a lottery ticket. 100% the best non-sale value of any factory laptop you'll find. If this laptop ever does go on sale, don't hesitate or second-guess yourself if you can afford it and you need/want a new laptop. This is the one to get. Fast, especially if you're like me and going from only HDDs to an OS on the SSD with room to spare AND a secondary 1TB HDD. From off to desktop in five seconds. Gaming: This is a great rig for gaming. Even intensive games don't completely tax this laptop (Unless you're playing Cities: Skylines with 1,300 mods installed). It plays Witcher 3 on Ultra and maintains 60FPS ALMOST all the time. Rock-solid 60FPS on High settings. Bloatware: There's not a whole lot compared to your usual suspects, which is extremely refreshing. CONS: Quiet? Not really. It's not very loud even at its loudest, but it's also not very quiet. The fans do a great job of keeping the Ryzen 7 CPU nice and cool, but that also means when it's under any amount of real load the fans are switched on, and you'll know unless you have wrap-around headphones on. Backlighting: This is a personal con to me. The backlighting settings aren't very intuitive and take some time getting to where you want it. But damn if it doesn't look pretty right out of the box going through the rainbow. Drivers: You'll have driver issues. Even after you update every driver, you'll still have driver issues. You'll have them until your third week in. Why? I don't know. Sometimes if you plug in your headphones, it sounds extremely strange until you do a restart. If you're patient, this won't bother you. If you're like me, people will ask why you're calling your laptop a finicky bitch under your breath. Audio: The Realtek audio doesn't seem to be the same as the one on my Dell, which is what this replaced. The audio isn't as crisp, especially without Dell's additional settings and audio suite. If you listen to a lot of music on your laptop, you'll notice the difference immediately. It's not terrible, but in my book it's a con when songs don't sound the same across different laptops. Battery: This laptop was meant to be plugged in while in use. It is readily apparent if you use it on battery life alone, even on power-saver settings. It'll last three, maybe four hours doing light work/browsing. Not great, but far from the worst I've seen. That's about it.

I then googled video reviews, and found that almost all reviewers by professional techs recommended this laptop as a beginner's gaming machine. I have now used the laptop for approximately 12 hours and have these observations. First the negative. I HATE that all USB slots are on the left side of the laptop. There is nothing on the right side. I spend a lot of time gaming and laying down with the laptop on my belly and I have my left hand resting on the left side as I constantly use the Function 1-4 keys. The USB plug in adapter is rubbing a blister on my hand as there is no way to avoid it unless I don't use a mouse, which is unacceptable. The arrow keys are a little to far towards the middle, so I had to program the number pad keys for moving in game. Also, the F1 key starts too far to the right, so I have had to program my gaming keys somewhat. With that said, the laptop runs smoothly, is very quiet and does not run hot at all. Now I only play Everquest which is not a demanding game for a PC, but there is no heat or noise from the fans. I like the keyboard other than what I described above, and have no idea why some people have complained about the keyboard and touch pad. The lighted keyboard does change colors, but it isn't a distraction for me at all, so I haven't tried to change it to stay at one color as of yet. So I like this laptop.

The color is completely gone and the image is so dark, that unless you're sitting in a bright room or under a movie arc lamp, it is essentially useless. The second thing is the sound quality. For a gaming laptop you would expect the sound to be very generous, very deep, and very loud.

I was very happy with it, I've had it for 7 years and it's still able to run MMOs, albeit at low settings. I now have a desktop for gaming and didn't want to invest as much in another high-level gaming laptop, but needed a laptop for work and limited amounts of gaming/videos/etc. Now that I've been working from home for a few weeks (thank you, COVID-19), I've had a chance to spend a good amount of time on this computer. I have not yet tried gaming on it so I can't speak about that - I'll have to come back and update later. I have been working, though, and it's been great, especially for the price. I tend to work pretty RAM-heavily - lots of programs open, lots of browser tabs open - I haven't had any problems at all. I will probably add more RAM at some point anyway, but the amount it comes with is perfectly fine. When watching videos, the screen is nice and crisp with good refresh, but again, I haven't played any games. It seems to stay very cool, which is great as my old ASUS ran a little hot. It's practically silent, which is also nice because my old ASUS fans were a little loud. The keyboard is responsive. The keyboard glow is fun - my kids love it - and it helps me type in low light. The color on the keyboard changes colors and \"breathes\" - it's fine for me, but I wonder if there's a way to lock it on one color... if there is, I haven't found it yet. It can easily be turned off if it's annoying, though. I do have a few complaints - not big enough for me to subtract a star, but I'd like to mention them nonetheless. 1. The trackpad is left of center. I read other reviews that mentioned this before buying and it didn't sound like a big deal, but it actually is pretty annoying. I, like most people, I assume, use the trackpad with my right hand. Whenever I reach for the trackpad/mouse, it's not where I expect it to be and I end up right-clicking when I mean to left click. I also touch it sometimes with my left hand and end up zooming when I want to just move the mouse. Not a deal-breaker and the fix is obviously to use an external mouse, but I like to have the trackpad option for when I'm traveling with the computer. I'm not sure why they put it to the left of center, but if they had to put it one way or the other, I'd rather it be to the right of center. Notes for next time, ASUS. 2. There are not separate home and end keys. The key is home by default and end with the FN key. I use the home and end keys frequently and having to hit FN to use end is a little annoying. I get that a laptop has limited space, but I would rather have had home and end be primary functions on two of the keys above the numpad and other functions be FN+ functions (I hope this makes sense). Or maybe the plus sign next to the numpad could have been smaller to allow for one more key. There had to have been a way around it. 3. I don't know why, but my space bar has a tendency to double space. I'm a good typist and type on lots of keyboards - I've never had this problem before so I don't think it's something I'm doing, I think it's something to do with the space bar itself. Again, not a huge deal, but just a little gripe. So in summary/TL;DR - Great laptop for the price, a few little tweaks by ASUS would make it even better."}, {"name": "Ed", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2020", "title": "Cheapest 120Hz laptop?", "review_text": "First of all, the 120Hz display makes a world of difference. After 5 years of 120Hz desktop displays, 60Hz displays look stuttery and slow. Once you get used to it, theres no going back, and now you can get one in a budget gaming laptop??? The screens great, apart from mediocrity colour reproduction, but a laptop isnt just a screen, what drives the screen is just as important. The gtx1650 and ryzen 5 CPU do an adequet job of driving most modern games into the 90-100fps region at medium settings 1080p. Even though the gtx1650 isnt the most powerful gpu, its enough to see the benifits of 60+ fps gaming in most games, even if some settings may need to be turned down.  I would choose 120Hz screen and medium graphics over 60Hz and high graphics anyday; perhaps laptop screens are too small to really notice graphical improvements from medium-high settings. The model I purchased only has 8GB of ram in single channel. I highly recommend upgrading it to dual channel for improved gaming perfromance- ryzen CPUs love their memeory bandwidth. Boots times and snappiness are noticeably better than my old non-NVME SSD laptop. In other words the included NVME SSD is plenty fast and really appreciated at this budget price point. I also added a extra 500GB SSD. Its alot cheaper to add your own extra storage than buying an upgraded everything laptop ($75 vs $300-400) Everything else is as it should be for a budget gaming laptop- usable keyboard, poor battery life (3-4 hours) average laptop speakers and a mediocre trackpad. Overall I am very pleased with the laptop, it does what its supposed to do: play videos games. In fact it does it fairly well with a 120Hz screen, and at a budget price point at that!

Although there are settings for it in the Armoury Crate software, these do not work. Instead, you have to download a separate tool, the TUF Aura Core. Even then, while the controls in that app do work, the brightness setting has absolutely no effect. This means you can either have a fairly bright rainbow vomit keyboard, or you can change the settings in the TUF Aura Core app at the cost of making your keyboard much dimmer.

I use a Logitech headset that comes with a USB audio adapter, I plug that in and there are no problems.

I purchased this Laptop From The Amazon Warehouse for $487. I signed up for a Credit Card and got $125 off that; for a total of $362. I saw this laptop on the sight for around $799 for a while. I did my research, and there were not that many reviews out there. The few I saw for this model were from foreign reviewers (Pakistani or Indian....I was not sure). The Ryzen 5's were not being represented. Now this thing has quirks. It stated that it comes with a 256 PCIe NVMe drive. Mine DID NOT. It had a 256 gig CHEAP M.2 NGFF SSD (2280) drive. Luckily I had a spare NVMe drive (512 GIG), to swap out. It does come with 8 gigs of DDR4 2666 mhz RAM (which the system runs a 2400 Mhz.). I purchased another matching 8 gigs for a total of 16 gigs. I also added a 1 TB Crucial SSD for game storage. I consider myself a seasoned PC builder and troubleshooter. When swapping out the SSD, I didn't have the adapters to do a clone, so I decided to just install from a fresh copy of Windows 10 Home. I downloaded the Drivers and the BIOS'. The installation was \"tricky\". I was able to figure it out after about 90 minutes of trying to get the system to recognize my USB boot drive. Once installed, I then had to install the drivers, which were NOT in your typical installation format (a bunch of .bat files, and some bum witchery to get them installed). And don't get me started on trying to update the BIOS. Once everything was set up, I was greeted with just a \"meh\" amount of performance. I have a Dell E5470 with a 6th Gen i5-6440H (with just 4 straight cores, no Hyper Threading), that seems peepier than this thing. That laptop only has the intel HD 530 graphics, and it plays games (albeit only at 720p and a mix of low to medium settings), but that laptop cost me $120 on eBay. The only redeeming factor for this laptop is the nVidia GTX 1650 graphics. That one thing made this laptop bearable. Games look grat at 1080p, and they look look GREAT at 720p. I am still playing \"older games\" like Fallout 4 (albeit with a TON OF MODS), and the game looks and plays almost as well as my Desktop PC. I started playing Shadow Of The Tomb Raider, (on a mix of medium to low) and at 1080p the game performs great. So in conclusion: Do I Recommend this laptop? Well if you already have a decent Desktop Gaming Rig, and need a portable solution on the cheap - then yes, this is a viable addition.

You can also upgrade things like the amount of ram and storage space fairly easily, which is a big plus. Gaming: For gaming, I play Yakuza 0, Rocket League, Overwatch, and Civilization 5 (nothing graphically intensive) and usually get around 90-170 fps on medium to high settings. minimal studderring, but the one drawback is to get the most out of the machine, you need to have it plugged in to run at its turbo setting (which also is very loud so I'd suggest investing in some really good headphones unless you don't care about noise.) you can still play it without plugging it in, but obviously to not as stellar results as I couldn't get past 45 fps for Yakuza on medium settings when it wasn't plugged in. I really wish they gave you an option to use the turbo mode without plugging in the battery so that you can get a better test as to how long the battery could last. Another issue is that since you only get 256 gigs of memory (220 with bloatware installed) you have to pick and choose which game you want to download since space can fill up very quickly. Recommend an upgrade to those who get this and plan to do a lot of gaming. Side note, having a 120Hz screen is a big plus, especially for multiplayer games. School: I have it mostly for math and some minor work in Microsoft Office programs. It's been pretty good in that regard, but I did have a weird situation about two weeks ago when I was trying to work and it just crashed for no reason. I wasn't doing anything intensive, but I just went to a black screen and I had to force a restart. General Usage: It does exactly what it needs to for just browsing the web. Though the only eight gigs of ram could become a big issue if you're someone who likes to have eight to ten tabs or more open at once, so I'd recommend an upgrade to sixteen gigs (which is the highest you can get) for this laptop. The rgb settings for the keyboard are optimal and very easy to use. Overall: I'm satisfied with this laptop, despite the minor flaws.

If I was to improve upon this, which personally I have. I would upgrade the battery, storage, cpu, and gpu. However they have models like so. For its price I'd say its pretty solid as long as you dont need a battery and run plugged in part of the time. I wouldnt say its a bad thing, but I have to denote that. I've had it for a month, and I put a Kingston 32GB 16x2 DDR4 2,666MHz CL15 Sodimm 240pin kit in it, a 1TB Samsung Evo 860 SSD, and its very easy to open and work with inside. I strongly suggest putting another ram chip inside for dual channel. Its very snappy and reliable. I hosted a 7 Days to Die server and hit just about 17GB usage in ram. I didnt even feel it performance wise. However for gaming, its not amazing. I can run The Witcher 3 in 1080p with 'most' settings on high/ultra but it lacks in AA's, Shadows, and resolution in older games. Most of my games however are older and can run between 48-120 depending on the engine caps. Fallout 4 does not work for me. Fallout New Vegas on max runs about 55fps. Lets put it this way. The screen is 120Hz, but most games wont hit that in fps. It can run modern-ish titles but nothing ram (gpu ram) dependant. I.E 11GB = nope. At the end of the day I'm happy with it.

But when I'm traveling or vacationing, I often still want to play some games with my friends when I have downtime. Without having to lug a whole desktop workstation around or breaking the bank, anyway. And this laptop is perfect for that. It's great for the games I play the most: Eve Online, Planetside 2, Battletech, and even The Division 2. The latter which is probably the most strenuous game I've successfully been able to play on it, even keeping pretty decent graphics settings on the 1660ti with a steady high framerate with no hitching or hiccups. I did try Star Citizen out on this laptop, but it didn't go to well. The poor thing struggled to even load the game! I have no problems multitasking between games and several browser tabs and Discord and whatever else. I can run 4 Eve Online clients on it (on low settings at least) with no problem. The computer will get hot during demanding games and tasks, but it does a great job of keeping that heat away from your hands and fingers. Some laptops I've used get uncomfortably warm around the keyboard when you start stressing it; this is not one of those laptops. The fans will get loud of course. But I haven't experienced any overheating shutdowns. As with all gaming laptops, don't use this directly on your lap under high load. It won't literally burn you, but it probably won't feel pleasant either. To continue on that point, just like most gaming-oriented laptops, battery life isn't great. Even when only using it to browse the web and/or watch YouTube videos, a couple hours is probably all you'll get. You'll definitely want to keep this plugged in while gaming, which again, is pretty typical of gaming-oriented laptops. The giant brick of a power adapter will help deliver all the power you need while playing your favorite games. One reason I went with this model, as opposed to other gaming-oriented laptops that may have been a better value, is that it doesn't overtly look like a gaming laptop. It doesn't look like a unicorn vomited all over it with RGB lights. It doesn't scream \"HEY THIS GUY IS A GAMER Y'ALL! \"The most RGB lighting it has is the software-controllable, LED back-lit keyboard. Otherwise, it looks mostly like a regular laptop. As far as build quality, It's decent. The plastic-body is solid and can withstand minor shocks and drops. It's matte-finished all over, which helps decreases the amount of palm prints and such you'll see on it. It overall feels sturdy, owning up to its name as \"TUF.\" While I'm used to carrying around a much slimmer 13\" Macbook Pro, the thickness and weight is still very reasonable. One downside is the trackpad. Trackpads have come a long way, even the plastic, non-glass ones. This one, however, feels like a step backward. It's flimsy, loud, and it has a weird \"drag\" on it when using it. Like sometimes my fingers get stuck when tracking across the pad. I'm not sure if Asus figured that most owners will use mouse or what. All I know is that it feels and sounds cheap, which is weird in a laptop that has otherwise done a good job of hiding its budget-friendly cost. I'm not a \"display enthusiast,\" so the most that I can say is that the colors and brightness seem pretty good. It's at least as good as my standard desktop monitors. I have noticed the higher refresh rate, which is a nice little benefit. It really does make for smoother visuals, in especially in games like The Division 2 that have a lot of motion. The built-in speakers aren't half-bad for a laptop. I do like the \"full-sized\" keyboard. I say it that way because the arrow keys and numpad are squished in. But I haven't had any problems using the numpad, even though I thought I would. My biggest recommendation post-purchase would be to upgrade the HDD. I have the model that comes with a 256GB solid state M.2 and a 1TB hard drive. The HDD, which is meant to store most of your games, only spins at 5400 RPM. For some games that have high read/write demands, there were noticeable, slight but fairly frequent pauses as the HDD spun up repeatedly. This doesn't happen with all games, but for some it did happen and it was annoying. I pretty quickly replaced it with a 1TB SSD and that problem went away. I paid $80 for a new SSD and it was well worth it. In addition, upgrading was pretty painless and quick. No more than 20min for the swap. Make sure to get the owner's manual on the Asus website so you know the process if you're unfamiliar with messing around with laptop internals. Overall, I'm super happy that I bought this laptop. It's a great value all around. I still use it as my secondary gaming station in my house when not traveling.

HIGHLY recommended", "review_text": "I've been a console gamer for a decade and wanted to fiddle with PC gaming again. Couple this with my 8 year old everyday MacBook air showing its age, I figured this laptop would serve as an affordable backup and entertainment device. I'm pleasantly surprised at how well it's holding up since I received it about 2 weeks ago. The pros: -STURDY build. Yes it's plastic all around, but it feels solid. No cheap design here -BRIGHT, pretty 120Hz screen. -Great game PERFORMANCE for the price point. Purchased this laptop with reasonable expectations given the price I paid for it. Obviously not gonna be running Red Dead Redemption 2 on ultra at 120fps, but this will smash any triple A title at mid-high settings at 30+fps. For a laptop at this price, you won't get better than this. My go-to titles are BeamNG (45-65fps on highest settings), fortnite (75-100fps, epic settings, girlfriend makes me play this with her, judge all you want), CS:GO (100-120fps easily) and many others of similar graphic demands. The Ryzen CPU paired with the GTX 1650 offer smooth performance. Will not break any records, but you will be content based on what you pay. Just go in with reasonable expectations. -It LOOKS great, love the LED color changing keyboard. -FAST startup and program loading. Expect the laptop to start up within 15-20 seconds of hitting the power button including boot up time and windows logging you in. That's blazing fast, thanks to windows booting from the SSD, paired with fast DDR4 Ram and the nice Ryzen cpu. -QUIET overall noise. When all settings are on high in-game, the fan will go on full blast but it's very quiet compared to other high performance laptops I've played on. Put the game sound on and you won't hear it much. -Someone else stated in their review that the top of the laptop does NOT get hot. Even under full graphical load. Only the air in the back gets warm, but I'm impressed with ASUS's cooling system as it appears highly efficient at dispelling heat. The Cons (please keep in mind the price of this laptop, these cons are stated generally but are to be expected) : -BATTERY life is very average. When not gaming, I seem to be averaging out around 3 hours. That isn't remarkable, but isn't terrible. Gaming on battery only is pointless unless it's a very light game. I unplugged while playing BeamNG on all high settings and looked at the predicted battery usage.... went down to 30 minutes remaining at 99% battery. Yeah, no point. -STORAGE is unacceptable for a gaming laptop. It only includes a 256gb ssd which is virtually impossible for anyone who games. To put this in perspective, Fortnite on PC is roughly 60gb big. Given Windows takes up a decent amount of space as is, JUST installing fortnite and nothing else, you'll have about 140gb remaining. Add 1 other big game like Red Dead Redemption 2 (120+ gb) and you're already out of storage or nearly out. 2 big games taking up all the space on a GAMING laptop? That's unacceptable. Given the price point, though, I have no problem investing in a second 512gb or 1tb NVMe SSD to make storage more manageable. -RAM only comes in 1 stick of 8gb. This isn't so much of a con as the others, but 8gb is beginning to be the absolute minimum requirement for modern gaming. Expect games coming out in 2020 to require 16gb for a solid gaming experience (some that came out in 2018-2019 already recommend 16gb). 2 notable things I did right away to improve my experience: - Purchased another stick of 8gb Samsung ram and installed it. Opening up the laptop for the first time proved somewhat of a chore. I used a guitar pick to squeeze into the seal and carefully work my way around it to get it open. The Ram I purchased was Samsung 8GB DDR4 2666MHz RAM Memory Module for Laptops (260 Pin SODIMM, 1.2V) M471A1K43CB1, bought here on Amazon. Careful to not touch the gold pins of the ram, as that can degrade it prematurely via fingerprint oils. Also, beware of static electricity, the #1 pc killer. I installed it easily (watch youtube for a tutorial), and closed it back up. Now my laptop runs at 16gb of RAM in dual channel setup. I don't notice much of a difference yet while gaming, but this is essentially to future proof it. Some of my games start to chip away at full 8gb usage, so doubling it protects you from unexpected slow downs should they occur. - Purchased an external 1tb usb hard drive from Western Digital. I needed a backup drive to store everything from my Mac on it anyway, so I figured I would use this temporarily to run big games from while I save up for another NVMe SSD. As the laptop includes a usb 3.0 port, I haven't noticed any performance issues running games via external drive on steam. Perhaps a tiny frame rate dip, but nothing blatantly noticeable. Final thoughts: - Very satisfied with my purchase. This is a solid mid performance level laptop with a 120Hz screen and competes well with the bigger boys that run well over $1,000. If you need a budget gaming laptop, consider this one. Just beware of the low storage and expect to spend a bit more on upgrades down the line on RAM and Storage. All in all, a fantastic budget gaming laptop."}, {"name": "Mumin C.", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2019", "title": "SUDDEN FPS DROP_ASUS TUF GAMING DX505DU", "review_text": "While playing game FPS drops down to 10 for 5-10 seconds, every 1 or 2 minutes.

Usually I like to save money and get one used. I am so glad that i bought this one! The AMD Ryzen 5 chip is very fast and snappy. The FHD display is beautiful and has great contrast. The exterior is a nice, sleek design. I do wish the exterior was a little more rugged but for $650, it's definitely a great value. The battery life gives you about 5-6 hours of basic computing time (internet browsing, MS office, emails). I am a non- gamer so i cannot give feedback for game play performance. Although the display is only 1080p, it does play 2K and 4K videos off of Youtube and Netflix. They look sharp and smooth. Overall, I am happy with this laptop so far. The warranty seems to be decent but i need to read more into it. I love the rainbow keyboard but will probably turn it off to save battery life. I plan on editing 4K videos and I will update this review once I see how it performs with that. Another thing I liked was the packaging. The laptop comes in a cool \"TUF Gaming\" box with a handle that could be re-used and is wrapped in a micro-fiber type of cloth fr protection. I didn open it up to see how hard it would be to upgrade RAM and it's very simple. The whole bottom piece comes off. The battery is built into the motherboard so replacing wouldn't be easy for most.

Most of the limiting factors on this laptop, you can upgrade to your need. I bought the Ryzen 5 3550H, GTX 1650, 256gb  with 8gb of RAM version for 760$ after tax. The limiting factors on this version would be the 256gb of storage and 8gb of RAM. But, the great thing about this laptop is that you can upgrade these components. Get another 8gb of RAM to make it 16gb dual channel will greatly improve performance and this laptop has a 2.5inch sata drive so you can add like 1tb of SSD storage for $100. The Ryzen 5 and GTX 1650 aren't power houses but for under $800, they are incredible value. 1650 is slightly more powerful than a 1050ti and if you are willing to run the graphics at medium or low for AAA games, you can easily maintain 60fps. Especially if you are going to add another 8gb of RAM. Most of the games I play, do not require anything stronger than a 1650 so I can take advantage of the 120hz display (which is awesome for this price point). Ryzen 5 works just fine and isn't that much worse than the Ryzen 7 CPU. Overall, this is a great value laptop. I'm not a particular fan of the aesthetics, but it gets the job done for most people out there and at the end of the day, I'm willing to accept that. It runs the games I play amazingly well. Do some research and see how well the specs hold up to your gaming needs."}]},

This chromebook has far exceeded my expectations. This is my first time using a chromebook. I have had a week or so to really dig into the device. I own an alienware gaming laptop, but I find myself only using it now for gaming purposes only. This chromebook is fast in my opinion. The speed is snappy and the device responds quickly to gestures and commands. I have yet to find sometime I can't do on this that I do on my windows laptop aside from gaming. One game I like to play requires windows, mac, or linux. Since this has an ARM processor it does not support linux applications at this time. Design: This device is a bright attractive white chromebook. I find the design to be pleasing to the eye and appears sturdy even though it is made from plastic. I do not particularly like using it in tablet mode. The screen feels bulky and sometimes unmanageable in tablet mode. The screen quickly transitions to whatever position to place it in whether laptop, tent, or tablet mode. I personal find myself not even using my LG tablet for much of anything except when I need LTE internet away from home. Overall the design is great. Screen/Input: I find the keyboard to be on par with most laptop keyboards. The keys are a little shallow and I feel my typing has slowed a little bit, but not by much. The IPS touchscreen is very responsive and rarely find myself having to touch the screen more than once for my intended gesture. Screen is bright in home conditions, but feel it would lack in more intense lighting situations, such as outdoors. Ease of Use: The google play store makes this thing be able to do just about anything. I have not tried any intense applications. I use chrome, netflix, hulu, evernote, several banking apps, and various other apps. All of them are snappy responsive. The bank apps load like they are in phone mode, thus they are in a small window. The apps still work as designed. Netflix and Hulu playback is smooth and pleasant to watch on the screen. Overall, I am impressed with the Google OS and this device in general. If your someone who is on the fence about the operating system, I suggest you give it a try. The battery life is good as well. When using my gaming laptop its always with a cord tethered nearby. I also understand a gaming laptop is far more power intensive. I have yet to use this chromebook while charging it. The battery has allowed me to watch 4-5 hours of netflix, talk on facebook, and text through my phone without ever getting critically low. I charge it at night and then never put it back on till the next night. This is a max screen brightness. I was also very surprised with the speakers. The speakers were much louder and not distorted. I honestly expected them to be cheap netbook quality that is mostly better just to never use them, but thats not the case with this chromebook. I do generally use a bluetooth headset. The bluetooth headset paired with extreme simplicity. I also set up my brother wireless laser printer with google cloud print in less than 30 seconds. Google did it right and lenovo delivered a solid product. I did purchase this on sale for $200 but would have spent the $300. If your a web surfer, music listener, netflix watcher I highly recommend this. If you need windows intense software then go with windows.

Better Chromebooks have Intel Core CPUs for great performance. The much cheaper Mediatek system in this Chromebook gives it mediocre performance, especially for intensive games or for business users who open lots of tabs simultaneously and frequently switch between them. On the plus side this Chromebook has a useful 4GB of RAM, a sharp colorful IPS screen, a touch screen that works great with Android apps, a very responsive (for swiping) touchpad, and reliable WiFi (much better than my HP laptop). On the minus side, the white plastic shell looks and feels a little cheap, the screen is not very bright, and the touchpad's button feels a little clunky. In summary, if you can't afford more than $300, this is a good choice for casual users who only have a few tabs open at once and use it mostly for email, Facebook, web surfing, and streaming music or videos.

You can operate this in all different ways; as a laptop, flat tablet or tent mode to watch your favorite movies. Touch screen is very responsive, I kept forgetting it's a laptop! One gripe however, the SD card slot is shallow; put a SD card in the it sticks out more than half the length. So you wouldn't want to leave the card in; must remove it after use. Of course, you know the benefits of a Chrome book. Light weight (in many ways, both software and hardware), no need for tedious OS upgrade, no worries about viruses while providing everything a computer user needs.

They are portable, cheap enough to haul where ever you go and fit one both airplane trays and the teeny desks they give students at college.

Lots of connections SB-C 3.0 port USB-A 3.0 port, a full-size HDMI connection and a DisplayPort port a full-size SD card reader, combo audio jack.  There is NO Thunderbold 3port. Keyboard is excellent for the size.  Nice rebound to the keys. Folds so watching videos is easier.

We have all become a little spoiled with the clarity of phones, this is noticeably lower.  It has a refresh rate of 60Hz so it is fine for catching a little Netflix, but do not expect high def quality. No backlighting on the keyboard. No number pad. Its too slow for intense gaming.

I had to return the first one I bought, because there was a problem with the sleep and the bluetooth. Sleep, because when I would close the lid, it would just power off the device, rather than putting it in suspension. Bluetooth, because when connected to a bluetooth mouse for anywhere between 5 to 30 minutes, it will bug out and refuse to work again until it's rebooted. Now, I had thought that the problems might be related, and since it was a hardware issue, the replacement would be free of both problems. However, I was wrong, unfortunately. It seems the bluetooth issue is just what the device does. It's a bit disappointing, as my Moto X Pure Edition (which was the first Moto X made by Motorola after being purchased by Lenovo) had nearly this very same issue with its bluetooth. It makes me draw the conclusion that Lenovo makes poor decisions when they choose who they use for bluetooth radios. That aside, everything else about this Chromebook is fairly surprising. It's snappy, sounds good, looks good, works well. It's a lot better than it has any right to be at the price point they have it at. I am, again, disappointed that their cost saving measures had them put in a faulty bluetooth radio in them, but I will find a way. I work from this thing, so I can't be without it again, and I am not rollin' in the dough, so beggars and choosers and all that. If bluetooth isn't a huge need, this is the ticket. If bluetooth is a big deal, you might want to invest in a more expensive chromebook from someone like ASUS, who uses great hardware."}, {"name": "Wallygirl47", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2019", "title": "My Lenovo c330  chromebook is AMAZING! 4gb RAM and 64 gb", "review_text": "Before I share my thoughts on the product I would like to preface with a disclaimer that I am an educator who has used Chromebooks as a tool for teaching and for my own work projects.

No problems opening the packages or initiating start up with the Chromebook.  The winter white case is plastic and may require extra care.

Also, because I noted the complaints with regard to speed associated with memory, I did purchase the larger 4 gb RAM and 64 gb memory with a SSD.

Today is 4/16/19 and I am still enjoying my Chromebook.  A couple things that have come up with regard to the laptop keyboard: the keys can pop off if snagged.

I needed to replace my 9 year old Macbook Pro that was an excellent machine but just couldn't handle modern computing needs. However, I have a desktop for more intense computing needs, so I really didn't want to spend $1000+ on a new MacBook to browse the web, watch YouTube videos, read eBooks, watch Netflix etc in the evening. Cheap laptops in the sub $350 range are frankly almost all junk, so I wasn't really interested in buying one of those either. I don't want a tablet because I want a keyboard and I like to lie flat in bed and that's just not convenient. Enter the Chromebook! So far, this has been an impressive solution for the purchase price of $231. Of course, Chromebooks have a variety of hardware and you need to do your homework to get the best experience. For about $50 more than lesser Chrombooks, this is an ideal middle ground solution. Within its comparable price range, the MediaTek MT8173C processor scores at the top as far as processing speed. Coupled with 4GB DDR3 RAM and a 64 GB SSD for boot speed, plus how lightweight of an OS ChromeOS is, this is a very well performing little machine for the price. Web browsing is snappy, YouTube loads very quickly and the Google Play store gives you access to all the apps you need. So far, all apps have loaded without any issues and function well. The battery life is remarkable - I've gotten 13-14 hours of use from it and still had 15% when I finally plugged it in. ChromeOS is super easy to learn/user friendly and reminds me of the user experience of a phone/tablet. NOW - this machine is not a few things. It doesn't have a super high resolution screen, but it's a small screen, so it's not bad, but if you're used to a Retina screen it will be a bit lower in quality. It is fine and perfectly functional, but not exceptional, as a tablet (not the best touch screen response and obviously heavier than normal tablets and ChromeOS isn't as optimized for touch screen use compared to phone/tablet operating systems - think things like bigger front/back/X buttons - those aren't as prevalent on ChromeOS). The keypad is nice and sensitive but the click is loud. Printing is probably a pain but I have a desktop for that, so I don't care. So far, those are really the only cons I have found to this machine, but the pros far outweigh and you need to be realistic about features vs. price. It does a lot of things really well at the current list price of $251. It is not a $1000 laptop and you simply can't expect $1000 features from it. I'm very glad I spent the extra money for this over the sub-$200 Chromebooks with lower quality hardware and no convertible/touch screens. The convertible/touch really makes it fun to use. So, in summary: If you just need a machine to do run of the mill browsing, streaming, etc I think this is an almost perfect solution and an excellent value for the money."}, {"name": "Zhuansun Ren", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2018", "title": "Great low-end chromebook for web surf", "review_text": "I got my device for $200 (normal $300) on Black Friday.

Very Impressed.", "review_text": "Regarding Chrome OS.  This is my first chromebook so I'm still learning, but so far I'm extremely impressed!  It seems like the chromebook was the computer I've always needed but never realized I wanted!  Marrying the pc experience to an android compatible operating system is magical.  Although I'm apprehensive about this browser-based computing, I've found it very easy to save and edit documents offline so I'm still able to work on the go.  I can also connect it to my android phone, send and receive text messages with it, emulate old school video games (GBC, NES, SNES, GBA, and NDS), connect it to my bluetooth speakers and blast some jams.  I regret not making Chrome OS a part of my life MUCH sooner! Regarding performance.  I've heard people say this processor is mediocre.  I have to ask, what are those people even doing to arrive at the conclusion?!  I have not once seen the slightest indication that this thing isn't *completely* competent for daily needs.  Incredible response time.  No lag when scrolling.  Minimal to no delay opening apps.  Stunningly fast start up time.  I feel like it's a pretty outstanding performer, overall.  Sure, it's no high end gaming machine, but who buys a Chromebook looking for advanced gaming capabilities?  The bottom line: you click; the computer responds instantly.  Really, what more could you ask for? Regarding the build quality.  It's a bit bulky in its \"tablet\" mode and lacks the premium build materials of high end chromebooks, but it still looks and feels great - certainly better than any laptop PC I've ever owned!  The white color is gorgeous.  The size is perfect.  The keyboard is comfortable and the touch pad is large and responsive.  If you look closely you'll see Lenovo coated the touch pad with a hefty clear coat to prevent wear and tear.  As someone who immediately coats touch pads with contact paper to prevent damage, this is an impressive step, however inconspicuous to the average user.  Additionally the hinge feels solid and smooth.  The construction of the entire build just feels extremely sturdy.  The monitor produces extremely sharp images with outstanding color.  Although many people express dissatisfaction with the lack of 1080p and the larger bezels framing the monitor, I didn't even notice!  If you're not planning to do professional photo editing, I doubt you'll notice either.  (Side note: If bezels really concern you, consider the experience of flipping this into tablet mode and walking around with it while working.  Wider bezels in this situation result in fewer accidental screen taps from fingers that are curled around the edges holding it.) I absolutely recommend this chromebook.  It's a steal at this price point, and stands to replace my quad core, 8gb Windows 10 laptop for most of my computing needs.  Sure, it's not a 1080p monitor, lacks a backlit keyboard, and isn't made out of aluminum, but goodness gracious if isn't the coolest, most practical little laptop I've ever owned. It was even featured as one of the best chromebooks money can buy as of Feb 2019 by Android Police and Android Authority!!"}, {"name": "Bender is Great", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2019", "title": "Great tablet replacement", "review_text": "My Kindle Fire 10 HD response is very slow and it needs charging at least once per day.

After the usual initial setup (which is very easy due to the simplicity of Google), the battery life is definitely longer compared to my old Chromebook. I didn't really clock it but even with multiple tabs running at full brightness and full audio, id say it was about 5 hours before I had to plug in, which sets you up for a good idea on how long it performs when you're frugal with your power usage. Audio was very clear, screen had good resolution and responsive touch feedback (but a fingerprint and smudge magnet!) and does well in the multiple tablet modes while still staying snug. Build-wise is where the issues arise. While light, it is very obvious after long use, plasticky. The keyboard tends to be rather noisy and clicky at at times non-responsive and annoying.

Basically, I just needed this machine to work as a gateway to my remote machines, and for that, this worked perfectly.  It's light, quick, and simply get's the job done.  If you can keep your work limited to stuff you can do in Chrome (and *some* Android native apps), then this particular machine should be able to get the job done. With that being said, my machine had issues with Bluetooth that I simply couldn't ignore.  Normally, I don't utilize bluetooth very often, but due to the nature of this device and the way I wanted to use it (i.e., highly portable with the 2-in-1 feature), I planned the purchase around it.  The Bluetooth was essentially non-functional.  After looking into it, I found that basically every Chromebook has issues with bluetooth (so it's not necessarily specific to this device), but despite trying everything I could to get the bluetooth even mildly functional (trying beta builds, updating drivers, experimental Bluteooth software, etc.), nothing worked.  Specifically, I could connect to the machine's bluetooth, but after a few minutes, the blueooth would completely cease to work and would only work again after a reboot. After realizing that I wasn't going to be able to fix this problem, I returned the device.  I then bought another 2-in-1 Chromebook that was a little more pricey (I'll try to avoid outright advertising for them, but it was $500 Samsung device, so it cost twice as much).  This device is leagues better. First, the bluetooth actually works.  I still see many of the \"quarks\" that every Chromebook has, but I an actually use the Bluetooth with little issue.  But, that's not the only improvement.  The machine itself is significantly faster, which may not be of much value for most, but certainly improves my experience.  The touchscreen is also drastically superior, allowing for active pen use.  Again, if the \"touchscreen\" portion of these devices aren't that big a deal, then this might not matter, but after using the active pen, I could never go back to a simple touchscreen.  On top of this stuff, the new machine is much lighter and much more comfortable.  I've had people comparing it to an iPad when in tablet mode, which was certainly not the case for the C330. All in all, the C330 is a fine device, but it attempt to be too much of too many things, and doesn't do any of it right.  It's cheap, which is a big plus, but not cheap enough.  It's a 2-in-1, but isn't very good as a tablet.  And it's a Chromebook, but slow and not completely functioning.  I'd suggest either going cheaper and finding a Chromebook that isn't a 2-in-1, or spending the extra money to find a proper 2-in-1.

The advantage of this, besides setup speed, is that you won't clutter your Chromebook's login screen with more than one account choice. Be sure to update your version of Chrome OS.

Everything I need to do on a laptop functions within the browser. Web apps are a thing in case you need certain desktop functionalities in a pinch. But I would like to reiterate: think of this as a lightweight device that runs a very optimized and very fast web browser. And I mean that; the browser on this thing can handle as many tabs as I would ever need at once. The OS itself is also smooth and responsive. This thing boots up in 5 seconds flat which is a miracle compared to windows laptops I have used in the past. Something important to note is that storage on this thing... isn't a thing. Well it is, but without a third party file explorer you are going to be using Drive as your main storage. Which is great because I was able to redeem the 100 GB free two year storage with my Chromebook. I recommend using cloud storage with Chrome OS anyway, as it will keep the operating system running quickly and it's just more convenient once you get used to maining it. TL;DR: Great purchase if all you use is the web browser; get used to using Google services (at least Google Drive)."}, {"name": "Boston Photo Man", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2019", "title": "Perfect my needs", "review_text": "I've been enjoying this laptop for a few days now.

Solid, beautiful Chromebook.", "review_text": "I'm new to Chromebooks but not new to computers. I am an old soul who learned DOS and so I'm most happy with something like Linux and therefore the Chrome OS being based off Linux and the ability for newer Chromebooks to run Linux and open source programs like LIbreOffice are extremely important to me. I recently spilled a whole glass of wine right onto my HP Chromebook 14 therefore I had to buy a new one (even after taking the laptop apart to dry it out). This Lenovo is beautiful. The quality is far greater than the HP piles of junk out there. The screen is magnificent for such a cheap little thing. I like the fact I can use my Logitech Blutooth keyboard and therefore hopefully never spill anything again. That's the beauty of Chromebooks though - everything was backed up online and I didn't really lose much. Picked up where i left off with this wickedly good Lenovo. I have used a lot of machines - including Macs and Dell. I don't feel the price for those things are justified in anyway unless you are a full time graphics dev or designer and need heavy overpriced programs like Photoshop. There are superb alternatives with open source. Inkscape, GIMP, Scribus...and more. Cheap Chromebooks can't do everything but they are getting better all the time. I highly suggest updating Chrome when you buy this laptop, restart it then open settings and turn on Linux Beta. Learn about the programs you can run and how intelligent Linux is at installing them. Overall I love the size of this Chromebook. The screen is clear and gorgeous. Resolution is wonderful. Wish the laptop had more than one standard USB port but I'll manage. (I back up all locally kept files onto a USB drive or sometimes Google Drive). Touchpad seems responsive. The ability to use the laptop as a computer or tablet is fluid and no complaints. Solid build and it looks overall like something way more expensive yet my bank account or credit card isn't bloated because there is a fruit logo on this thing.

I mean, they're middle-schoolers so they're not exactly known for their agility and grace. It's fairly no-frills. The box is cardboard. The instruction manual is a folded piece of paper. There's really not much to figure out with a Chromebook and I'd rather pay less for the machine than more for a glossy box and an instruction manual that kills paper and serves no purpose. Right out of the box it booted up nicely. I logged into my Google account and was instantly able to access my email, photos, etc. The touchscreen is nice because sometimes I'm just lazy and don't want to deal with using the trackpad. It was also super-easy to download apps from the Google Play store to use on the Chromebook. Plus, it has an HDMI slot on it so I can hook it up to the board in my classroom and project what I'm looking at to the kids. Is it a high-powered computer that suits the needs for graphics-intensive gaming or serious programs? Absolutely not.

It is definitely worth the price of around $300. It is small, lightweight (although could be more), responsive, looks great, smells new after months, smooth to use, track pad is pretty good, overall good chromebook. I'm not really too much of a Tech person but grew up with computers in my 20's mostly using it for school and personal stuff. I had it for a few months now so my beginning concerns aren't the same as my latter ones. I'll try to go over really quickly the basic beginning concerns I had then go through with my impressions with months of use later on. 1366 X 768 isn't HD but it's acceptable. Processing speed is 2.1 ghz, never had a problem or issue with lags. 4 gb ram is okay, probably wouldnt do 2 gb. 11.6 screen, I wanted something smaller so this is a plus to me. Bit heavy with 2.64 lbs for a small laptop but it's okay, still my lightest one. internet connection is good and bluetooth use was good. Processor never had a problem with Mediatek. Convertible to tablet mode is a plus. Solid state so processes quickly which is a big plus. Battery life is great, I hate charging and finding an outlet, but this goes on for more than 8-10 hours, just doing school stuff, no videos. I would say I searched like crazy in the beginning. I wanted one main personal laptop and one small convertible laptop and this was the best convertible one I could find on Amazon. I compared like 20+ laptops over a week, I was really putting a ridiculous amount of time on it. But I had specific things I wanted in mine, like speed, aesthetics, smooth performance, and valued those more than other things. I wanted things to be really convenient. I have started using chromebooks more because they are inexpensive and very convenient to use. They aren't too good for hardcore processing, but for school work or personal work, it meets all my needs. Whenever I use it, everything is pretty smooth and seamless. Start and shut down are almost instant. I have never had an issue with it's use so far. I think for me, the biggest plus is the elegance. It makes everything very easy to use, it looks great, it even retains its new smell after some months with light use. My other laptops have poor track pads but this one is infinitely better. I don't feel the need to use a wireless mouse as well. I ended up getting a screen protector for it for almost $20 because it was a touch screen. I like how it has a lot of features like hdmi cables, one usbs, even a memory card slot. I think for the price, it is definitely worth it. It feels like a very high end chromebook, although I generally wouldn't pay too much for a laptop in general because I don't need high processing. The buttons feel nice and smooth. There hasn't been much lag or delay time. Updates are easy and smooth. Screen is nice to look at and the colors are great. There doesn't seem to be much glare and it feels aesthetically pleasing. Yeah everything's really nice with this. There are some things I don't like about it though. Originally, I had planned to use this as a tablet part-time because I didn't want to buy paper textbooks. I thought of using all of it on this chromebook, but it turned out to not be convenient because it was too heavy. I would use it on the train and my hands would almost immediately get tired trying to read. I would have to rest is down on myself, which isn't a big deal but wanted something I could read ebooks and pdfs on conveniently. I don't know if I will end up getting another one to serve that purpose. It also is a chromebook so it cannot download files and stuff. I don't particularly like that because that stops it from being my main computer. I don't like putting personal stuff on my drive, like my expenses or whatever even though it is irrational and I do it with some apps. Maybe I should, but the fact that everything is on my drive to see makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. I don't mind that this computer cannot really do much without internet because I always have something saved on it. It has 64 gb of memory which I think is quite significant. I mean, if I couldn't put anything on the drive, I wouldn't feel that, but 64 gb + drive storage seems more than enough and I am trying to be a minimalist anyway. Yeah not that many cons. Anyway, I wanted a inexpensive laptop but this definitely performs up to par with most laptops. Never had a problem with it so far months into my purchase but did want something I could use as a tablet. Would definitely recommend. Definitely better than a lot of the stuff I grew up with that cost 3x more.

I was choosing between the Lenovo C330 and Acer R13 for a low end IPS touch screen chromebook. I bought both to physically compare. The Acer R13 was too bulky and big for my liking. So I went with the C330. At first, I thought that the trackpad noise the C330 was making was a manufacturing defect. I looked at reddit and saw that some people didn't have this issue while a lot did. So I bought another one to test out. It also had the same plastic tapping noise the first one I bought had. SO, I bought a third one. Same problem. The Acer R13 and my Acer E15 Windows laptop did not make these noises. Either the people on reddit are deaf, or I was unlucky and received 3 BRAND NEW broken laptops. What a shame. Another thing that is important to note is that I tried each computer for 2 DAYS at my classes and ALL 3 of the Lenovo laptops lagged and crashed while my Acer R13 did not crash or lag once. I only have 10 tabs of chrome open and discord open. Lenovo needs to step their game up. The only objective problem with my Acer R13 laptop is that the left click clicks twice in order to activate. Now listen here, I have the money to buy a high end chromebook and not deal with these issues that come packaged with low end chromebooks, so I 'm not asking for pity.  I'm just giving a warning to everyone else about these low quality computers. FYI, I'm not keeping these Lenovo cr*pbooks. I'm returning them and going with the only other option, the R13.

With 4GB of Ram and 64GB of drive space this has much more than most other Chromebooks in the same price point. Although not full HD (my only complaint) the screen is colorful and vibrant, and the touch screen responsive. Converting from computer to tablet works seamlessly. Whats nice is with the Mediatek processor you can load most (not all) Android apps.

I also had a IBM mainframe that came complete with all the huge disk drives  and a 6 ' wide printer and all the operating manuals and took a 16 ' box truck to move. Then Microsoft changed to Windows 7 , liked it OK but it got worse and worse with updates and then the notice about  quitting support and get Windows 10 or else! Well for me its else! I have tried Win 10  and absolutely hated it. Good bye Microsoft! I read all the reviews on every brand of Chromebook that I could afford being a disabled Vet. I decided on this Lenovo C-330. Ordered it on 7/16/2019 and got it the next day. Had no trouble whatsoever with setup , I followed the setup guide  and figured it would take hours to charge the battery and then do the setup.

First of all let me say that I have purchased an Acer 11 inch Chromebook and returned it last week because it was well terrible. I read a lot of reviews on the Lenovo, watch a lot of YouTube videos and I was fairly confident that I would be happy. I have to say I was not disappointed. The device shipped in typical Lenovo fashion and not too fancy packaging power cord small little booklet actually a pamphlet and the device itself. First things first the bad. There's not much bad to say about this device if you expected to be a gaming machine you will be disappointed it's a Chromebook. The display is IPS although it's slightly washed out the colors but sharp enough. The main drawback is the lack of ports there is one USB 3.1 and of course the USBC that is used for the power cord. You could use adapter and have 2 USB ports but this was she would be much better suited at least in my mind if it had at least two USB ports. Secondly the SD card, full size by the way sticks out way past the form factor making it not really a good way to store data. Unfortunately it doesn't go all the way in the body and it should. And last is it's White blizzard white is the only at color it comes in I don't know what's up with that. Now for the good and there's lots of goodness here. The quad-core mediatek processor is fast, at least fast in terms of what a Chromebook is. The touchscreen highly responsive the touchpad does not feel cheap and works really well although full disclosure I like to use a mouse. The case itself is made of plastic but it feels solid is no bending just a really nice quality filled to the tablet / Chromebook. Nice a tablet / Chromebook because it really is a Chromebook or laptop it doesn't work real well as a tablet it's a little big keyboard is on the other side but it works real good in tent mode that's for sure.

This chromebook is fairly light and small and gets the job done and there little to no wait time when you open the chromebook turning on automatically. There a bunch of things i noticed while using it is you can link your phone with the chromebook in where once you previously log into the chromebook beforehand you can unlock your chromebook right after by unlocking your phone (both have to have bluetooth enable). To search up shortcuts you can easily click the search button on the keyboard and type in shortcut and it have it where you can search all the shortcuts you can do and what nice is any additional keyboard say a bluetooth one can also do some of the shortcuts. Also there are options where you can close the laptop and you have two options you can either put the laptop to sleep or it just turns off the screen then there a option to lock it by closing it or not. nice note is if you have display off you can still listen to pandora,mp3,or youtube. Also for those who are wondering - you can play minecraft, ragnorak mobile (not fully keyboard control it only for texting in chat so no WASD movement) and hearthstone on it so it have it nice touch but you cant use the split screen feature from chrome so that a bummer now for the drawbacks. Also you can use microsoft word, excel and powerpoint from the googleplay store but you would need a account for it or just use the free online version. This is small nit pick - the screen is 720p yet it clear but it is noticeable when you use it long enough wish it was HD or 1080p also some apps are set to the 720p by default. the google play store youtube uses the quality of the screen while chrome youtube (basically youtube normally on browser) is more clear. Also skype doesn't have screenshare or sharesound so that a major bummer and skype seem to run slow on the chromebook in terms having people sharescreen their desktop it always come out blurry on some occasions and i have to minimize and reopen skype to actually see what going on. i haven't try video call yet so it up to debate. Lastly for discord from google playstore you would need to adjust some of the call setting for it to work. the default setting would cut you off mid sentence and random pausing in between. Another thing is you can't adjust the idle timer it either it goes to sleep, display turns off or stays on there no option to change it and when you have option to lock your desktop it end your skype call so you would have to go into settings for normal use, call use, and game use. lastly is your better off having your laptop go into sleep mode with locked instead of turning it off. when you shut it down the screen goes blank white then gets brighter and brighter then goes to black. it's just me being paranoid like it would be better if it just dims and turns off instead of going very bright then poof black not to mention if you usually play on medium to low brightness setting then having your screen go maximum brightness with no setting to change it get annoying not to mention when you open up your chromebook after shutting it off it adjusted your brightness setting as well as well a bright chrome logo before going into login. Mostly this is a nit pick since it bothersome when you are using it in middle of the night then when you turn it off it hit you with the brightest setting so i just end up closing it to sleep mode or shut off and look away. All in all it a pretty good chromebook i just wish it had more options in the settings as well have priority app settings in task manager"}, {"name": "Matthew", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2019", "title": "One year later......", "review_text": "I had to come on here and review this tablet because of how much I love them.

Pros: The battery can last a whole day of good usage, the screen quality is great, the keyboard feels nice, and my favorite thing: it's FAST! I was so sick of my slow as a** clunky hp laptop. It takes probably like 10 seconds to start up, and pages are quick to load. The laptop is a perfect size for sitting on your lap or putting in your bag, and it's really light to carry around. Not necessarily \"cons\", just stuff that takes a little to get used to: Like with any chromebook, most of the \"apps\" are just in another window of the browser. That being said, I managed to find a good add on to chrome for spotify and discord, but if you use other apps that you're used to on pc or mac, you might find that a problem. With microsoft apps, you could just use the online versions and they work fine for my student purposes. The touchpad feels a little inaccurate, but after some use, I got used to it. The two-finger scrolling and zooming feels nice, though. Also, the speakers are kinda washed out but again, I got used to it. Actual cons: It's crashed on me a handful of times already... normally, it's just a little annoying since it starts back up so quickly, but recently I had it crashed TWICE during an online midterm.

Fortunately, I was able to get this next-day Prime delivered to where I was staying in LA and began using it minutes after it arrived. To make this review easy, I'm breaking it down by main key features: display, keyboard, battery life, and build quality. Display: For the price, I don't think you're going to find one much nicer in terms of resolution and quality. Incredibly, you are getting a true IPS panel with nice viewing angles. I've found that the low res matte displays on other cheaper Chromebooks are incredibly difficult use and lead to eye strain. I'm a personal believer in purchasing as much screen real estate and pixel density as possible -- it really does make a huge difference. Another huge plus (and I'm not sure if this across the Chromebook line or specific to this one) is the night mode that cuts out blue light and boosts yellows -- this is another hugely important feature for me, personally. Touch screen functionality works fine. Display cons are that the bezels are massive and with it being super glossy, there can be lots of glare. Keyboard: Basically Lenovo has it figured out with keyboard layouts and feel. While it's nowhere near as nice as the Thinkpad keyboard, this one is laid out quite nicely and is easy to complete bigger writing assignments on. There's no backlight, which would be a huge plus, but for the price, it's difficult to find anything to complain about. The top row function keys will be familiar to those coming from the Mac ecosystem. Everything is very easy. The trackpad is also surprisingly nice for the price as well. Gestures work without issue. Battery life: This is where this computer truly shines. I purchased this while I was traveling during the winter and needed to it to complete weekly freelance assignments and had plenty of battery life while on the road. Even when being back home laying in bed watching Youtube or Netflix, the battery lasts all night, and then some. I basically never take the charger with me because I don't feel that it's necessary (unless it's already low on juice). In terms of just general surfing and Google doc stuff, you should be able to get a couple of days out of the battery. If you're watching videos and streaming, it's still a good full day's worth of battery life. Build quality: I've previously had an HP Chromebook and was not impressed by the build quality by any means. It felt cheap, almost like a toy. While this Lenovo Chromebook feels much more solid, I still wouldn't compare it to a Thinkpad or the higher end machines in Lenovo's lineup. Still, it feels quite durable and I've never worried about carrying it in a pack all day, or stacking books and other heavy items on top of it. The only thing that is kind of a bother is that the brilliant white finish does get smudges and dirty fingerprints on it. But that's more of a nuisance, not a flaw with the machine. For the price, you really can't do much better. So long as you have reasonable expectations for what you're getting and how much you're paying, you will be very pleased by this product."}, {"name": "James M Svec", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2019", "title": "Perfect Chromebook for anyone", "review_text": "The screen resolution and viewing angles are amazing on this device.

Lenovo, what the heck is going on with this charger?! Seriously - the charger for this Chromebook is HUGE, but that's not the problem with it - the problem is it doesn't work reliably!  I first noticed it a few months ago - the charger would mysteriously stop working for no apparent reason.  Because the display dims automatically when the charging cuts out, it became INCREDIBLY annoying if it was sitting on anything less than 100% stable because it would flicker backlight brightness, so I took to unplugging the USB-C cable when I'm going to be surfing for a little while.  Then, the charging became even LESS stable - it began requiring tweaking the cable slightly to get it to charge.  Now, it's getting to the point where I have to play the old coat-hanger-antenna trick with the charging cable to get it to charge - tilting and turning the cable and the laptop this way and that just to get it to charge.  And no - the problem ISN'T the charging port, as it has no problems with my roommate's USB-C charger, just the one from the box. For a modern laptop, instability in charging is inexcusable.  Hell, even with my first laptop 20 years ago this would be unthinkable.

I decided to get one because most of what I use a computer for doesn't require anything more heavy duty than what this has to offer. I'll still use my other computer should I require things like Photoshop or those heavier use programs, but since I got my Chromebook a week ago, I haven't even touched my other laptop. The Pros: Battery life - When it estimates that I have 12-13 hours of battery life, it means it. I can stream videos and multitask and it doesn't sacrifice that time. Time to charge is also impressively quick. Speed - I open the lid and it's on. It's that simple. No waiting for everything to load up. I had to do an update and it took maybe 10 seconds, including restart time. I know internet will vary depending on network, but I'm able to easily multitask and it's not dragging. I'm currently casting a video to my TV and have multiple tabs open on chrome, all with no lag to the video (which would often happen with my other laptop). Ease of use - If you're already a chrome/google user, switching over to a chromebook is a piece of cake. I didn't have to transfer anything, and I do have to eventually back a few more things up to my Drive, but again, that's easy. Getting used to more app-based programs than desktop ones is easy enough too.  Almost everything that would have required a windows download has an app version or a way to use it on a chromebook as well. Screen/Tablet mode - I haven't toyed too much with the touch screen, but it's a nice perk. I like being able to flip the screen around and turn it to the side and bam, it's a big tablet. So far I've only used it like this once to read some comics, but it was nice. Brightness is great too. I usually have it down halfway or less even. Size - I was worried about it being too small because my other laptop is somewhere between 13-14'' but it's a really great size. This thing is incredibly light too. Much lighter than I'd expected. Love it. The Cons, though extremely minor: Caps Lock - Mostly, it's a \"getting used to\" factor that I just haven't quite mastered yet. There's no caps lock key, and the search button that replaces it isn't terrible, but I think I'd have preferred to just have the caps key. (You can just press alt+search for caps lock easily enough though) Backlighting - my other computer had backlit keys. Totally an \"extra\" that's not necessary, but regardless. And that's it. If you're looking for something light and simple for everyday use, this is an incredible choice."}, {"name": "Mrs. T", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2020", "title": "Sorry I bought it", "review_text": "I heard alot about Chrombooks.

After a month of use I'd say it's one of my worst buys. Since this Chromebook has a ARM processor it doesn't have a Netflix app to download. Streaming Netflix via the browser is choppy ( buffers quite a bit ). Amazon Prime video app works great. Youtube also seems to buffer quite a bit. The screen doesn't auto-rotate when you go into tablet or tent mode. You have to manually enter a combination of keys to rotate the screen before you use those modes. In regards to using this Chromebook for Linux, it's a not great. You can't get the Microsoft provided Visual Studio Code since it's an ARM based machine; you can however get a ported version. You can't download and use Sublime Text, since they don't make a version for ARM processors.  You won't be able to install Linux over Chrome OS, since there aren't any ported flavors for the Lenovo Chromebook. Crouton behaves like a virtual machine with limited memory, so it Linux OS's on Crouton seem to freeze quite a bit. You will find lot's of articles about why other people won't use an ARM based Chromebooks for Linux anymore; in short too much configuration and not enough ported programs. It's still a great machine for light productivity, such as browsing the internet, drafting documents, etc. It's not Lenovo's fault; just try not to be an early adopter  of ARM based chips.

Younger people may not appreciate that as much as we do because our hearing & sight is not as good as it was many years ago,  Resolution could be better but for the most part is easy to see and hear. My wife has been using the C330 almost exclusively after we purchased it. There are several android apps that do not work well but the android apps she needs these days do work OK and that is all that is important for now. She did not like using the GMAIL app, so we turned on the linux option and installed the linux version Thunderbird mail .  Thunderbird mail  takes a little longer to start up than the other apps but seems to work very well. This is an ARM device so many of the applications that work on the Raspberry Pi etc will work on this device. Once installed the program icons can be placed on the shelf to be started as any other app.. There is/was a learning curve as the Chomebook does not have all the settings where  android devices normally keep the same settings. It appeared you must keep it in developer mode to run apps from unknown sources making it less desirable for us to access the Amazon App store. Switching to and from developer mode requires a complete reset, but as soon as you log in to Google your settings and apps are restored. It takes a few minutes, so it is not something you want to do often. In tent mode the Lenovo Chomebook is nicer than using the Samsung 8.1 tablet on a stand.  We used a wireless mouse at first but found it easier to just use the touch screen.  However the touch screen does not work as good as the regular android devices we  own.  We did play with the \"text\" mode where you write on the screen and it adds it to your document, fun but not for us. Overall, we are happy with the purchase, we did not want to spend a lot of money for a high priced quality Chromebook until we knew we would actually like using it.  As others have noted, this Chrome box is pretty nice, for the most part easy to use and probably more secure than most regular laptops.

Any of the negatives below relate to software - specifically MS office. Otherwise no complaints. 1. It requires some patience as you transition from MAC or Windows to the Chrome OS. Just take your time. I recommend not buying this as a gotta-have-today replacement. If your current PC is failing but still operating & you want to make the switch, do it before your PC fails. That way you can wade into your Chromebook. 2. Excellent value for the price. 3. The software is mostly free and available. My Chromebook email syncs my iCloud, Gmail, and Comcast accounts seamlessly.  Note: I do not have business accounts on this device. 4. Not to get geeky, but I did the research on processors. Their MediaTek MT8173C outperforms the other available processors in benchmark tests. 5. Get 64GB, not 32 or 16. Space fills up fast, especially if you aren't good deleting emails, etc. 6. Add a low-profile thumb drive. With another 64, 128, or even 256 GB, storing pix is a breeze. 7. 2:1 is nice, but I don't use it much. Nice to have feature for me. 8. The battery is great. With the multi-use type-C connector, it doubles as a port. Now, at 67%, I still have over 5 hours left. 9. Screen res is very good. Clearer than other laptops I've had. No complaints. 10. MS Office. I just don't like working on-line with Office. First, this is a small screen. Second, no matter the Internet connection, it is jerky - the cursor doesn't move smoothly. I wish I had an acceptable substitute - have tried others, but they are worse. 11. Mouse? No problem. 12. Plastic build some purists complain about? No problem, the fit and finish are excellent.

I originally was considering more expensive options, but I had tried his Chromebook for a couple hours (writing a paper using it) and I liked it too. I ordered a new one, and upon receiving it I plugged it into the charger for its first charge. The laptop seemed to work great in general when I started changing my settings and searching for websites.  However, the charger fit into the charging port very loosely, and when I moved the laptop on my lap it fell out easily. I figured I might have gotten a laptop with a faulty charging port and I returned it for a replacement. The second new Acer Chromebook R11 that Amazon sent me had a normal charging port. The charger fit well and did not fall out. But, the touchpad did not work. I tried to troubleshoot it and change touchpad settings, however every time I moved my fingers on the touch pad the cursor jumped around the screen.

The touch screen can also be used in laptop mode. It's all very responsive. The battery lasts ALL day! Depending on what you're doing with it and how you use it and for how long, you can make it last a few days before you have to recharge it. I usually am able to use it and charge it every third day or so. This is also able to load most all Google Play apps, just like your Android phone!

This only has 20GB memory. Not a problem for most, since they're meant to work from Google Drive or other cloud storage. But sensitive case files can't go on those, so I stuck a 512GB sd card in there.

This thing boots in under 2 seconds and I'm plugging away. 10 hour battery life means I charge it at night and that's it, unless I'm actually traveling and therefore using it all day (rather than my desktop or laptop). The only limitations are inherent to the android apps. Adobe doesn't support rendering documents text readable, and MS Word has fewer features as well. That's ok, those are mostly things I can do in the \"polishing\" phase from my office computer. This gets me to the 99% mark when I would otherwise be stuck.

This has to be the best \"bang for the buck\" machine that I have ever purchased.  The 10th gen 1035G1 i5 is obscenely fast when mixed with the 16gb ddr4 and the 1/2 TB NVMe sdd.  This is elegant as anything as well.  A beautiful chassis.  I was surprised by how light it is.  I guess that is to be expected since I think everything except for the cpu fan is solid state.  The onboard camera is very clear and a driver license text is legible for secure websites.  The CPU includes neural net instructions from the Xeon line for the first time for consumer in the 10th gen chips.  If you are doing data science with development suites like Anaconda using Jupyter notebooks or working with Netbeans or using a MySQL instance for learning this is blazing fast for a great price. In a nutshell, this offers Windows workstation performance with Chromebook simplicity/pricing. *update* Well I bought this on Dec 16th 19', so I figured an update was in order.  It is still running strong and I think that I have put it through its paces particularly on Steam gaming.  Some might say that the UHD G1 graphics are a bit \"light in the loafers\" I think that it is fine for the 1366x768p screen.  I got the latest \"Resident Evil\" demo to run albeit at mild settings but it still looked spectacular and acceptable frame rates. Some other newer titles like Destiny 2 will probably be a bit much rendered on the machine.  For older stuff like Portal2 you can run maxed out. The Intel 660p QLC drive is also really good i think for the price. Through installing and deleting I have about 2TB worth of mileage on the drive, still very fast, no wear according to S.M.A.R.T. I have not had any issues with the wi-fi on my unit.  I know it is not the fastest solution out there but on my Asus AC1300 router I get 325mbps from a different floor of the house the hypotenuse length being about 20-25 through a floor and a wall.  I can game on Google Stadia and download a series of torrents and keep my Comcast 100mbps service relatively transmitting a lot of data for hours with no drop-offs on the Wi-Fi.  Now granted I am stationary, I'm not jumping from tabletop to tabletop confusing the beam-forming of the router. So, it a solid performer that can handle some pretty heavy stuff thrown at it. *end of update*"}, {"name": "Danny Nguyen", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2020", "title": "2020 HP 15 15.6\" HD Touchscreen Premium Laptop", "review_text": "Key Points: - A cheap deal for a competitive performance laptop - Thin & Lightweight (Easy to carry) - Large storage space for basically any consumer need - Comes with HP Customer Service application on set-up (1-year warranty) Experience: If you're like me, you hate to buy something without the full confidence in the product first. Believe me, it's difficult sometimes to buy things online due to the limitation of only being able to rely on other customer's reviews before the product is purchased and arrives at your doorstep. However, I have a pretty positive outlook on this laptop for its price. I attached a few photos to showcase its exterior mechanisms, as well as showcase a general size of what laptop to expect in real-world size (as opposed to reading numbers and expecting to visualize that in your head). The laptop is about 23cm length by 35-36cm width with a thickness of 1.5 cm. The weight is as advertised, it's comfortable to carry around and will fit in thin spaces; it won't occupy too much room in a backpack or luggage. For its technical aspects, I used a free CPU test online called UserBenchmark to compare its performance to other users who also documented their computers/laptops. (This provides a bias as it only takes into account for users who test their computers on that specific software, but it's still a good comparison to get a general idea of the performance the laptop provides.) Attached also is the report containing simplified and relevant data to its specifications. Its computing power is where this computer shines the most, as it performs in the top 75%+ percentile, which is what most consumers will desire, as GPU is of less importance in that they don't intend to purchase a cheaper laptop with the intentions to play heavier & more demanding video games on it. I was actually pleasantly surprised to hear of a lower pricing laptop that came with 16GB of RAM, which is almost unheard of for this price range, and although I didn't document how much free space was available upon receiving and setting it up, there is still ~400+ GB available after transferring the bulk of my applications and user data from my old laptop. For the price it's set at, I personally think it's a great deal since its competitors will often price the same specifications for almost twice the price. As a side note, HP doesn't load the computer with so many useless applications as Lenovo does that the consumer will more than likely never use... (occupying memory). Overall, very happy & satisfied with my purchase, I would thoroughly recommend it, and I look forward to programming code with this laptop."}, {"name": "Josh", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2020", "title": "WiFi adapter will CONSTANTLY disconnect.

At this price, HP has to cut corners, and it's so painfully obvious they did. This laptop comes equipt with the Realtek RTL8821CE 802.11ac WiFi adapter. This piece of hardware is garbage. Don't take my word for it either, do some Google searches on it! Put in the part name + \"disconnect\" and issues come up in abundance. There are a multitude of threads on HPs own website, dating back from 2018 even, about how this WiFi adapter constantly disconnects or misbehave. The \"solutions\" that HP gives to to download a specific driver. Click the link and the file does not exist! And that's if you're able to get that far before the chip disconnects. The first 3 solutions I checked out did this, I'm not going to waste any more time with it right now. Summary: good specs, but the WiFi chip constantly disconnects, even requiring restart to fix it. Happens instantly after reboot sometimes. Stay away from this product until a fix for the WiFi chip is implemented. Planning on returning this headache of a computer unless I can find a fix.

MANUFACTURING - The laptop is made of plastic , quality is good but Could not compete metal body. Moreover , I love the design of screen , almost minimum bezel and it gives a premium look. Keyboard keys are smooth.I sometimes face a little issues with touchpad sometimes it stuck or hangs maybe i can call it less sensitive that isn't a big issue to worry also the touchscreen works really fine , no worries at all. There are no lights under keyboard pads,so it makes it difficult to type in dark. PERFORMANCE- This laptop starts pretty fast in almost under 20 secs, it will boot up and take you to desktop. I played Asphalt 9 on this laptop on the very first day and it played smoothly  , and you can play other games also but problem will be that it will be in low quality due to less resolution of screen otherwise processor has no problem in running games (for more information you can search for processor details on google according to your priorities).I would not recommend for gaming purposes. THINGS TO NOTE- Since this product is available from third party you won\u2019t be getting 12 months warranty cause they upgrade the laptop and then deliver further, in my case i got 9 months of warranty. Laptop is quite slim and gives a quite unique look. No problem with wifi and battery (4-5hrs on screen battery backup).

It starts almost immediately, in seconds.  It's not overloaded with useless apps, so not much to remove.  There is McAfee antivirus but it's not activated.  So in 1 month I'm not going to get annoying pop - ups asking me to pay for it. It's the first time I've had touch screen.  I didn't think I needed it, and probably wouldn't except that I am not teaching a graphic design class and the touch screen is very helpful.  Instead of using the mouse pad to draw I can use the screen, which is more accurate.  I wish the screen laid flat for tablet mode so that I could draw more easily.  but, hey, I didn't know I needed it and HP would most likely charge more for that. Only one complaint.  The construction wasn't well thought out.  The keyboard sits in a tray so there is a bezel around it.  It is constantly scratching at my wrists as I type.  Look carefully at the picture you can see that the silver underneath wraps up around the black keyboard UPDATE: 2 months into owning this computer and I'm still impressed by the speed.  Still hating the construction of the computer.  It's cheaply built but I'm ok with that because the inside is awesome.  I also found that the mic seems to be directional.  Doing a lot of virtual now and I find if I'm not directly in front of the computer, people say they can't hear me.  I think it needs an external mic.  The screen quality can be better.

Granted I just bought it a week ago so I might always come back and update this if disappointed- but so far so good. You are basically getting a mid level laptop with some premium features at a bargain bin price. Pros- Battery life is good to borderline impressive. For typical typing and internet surfing your getting a good 6+ hours. The touch screen is very good and excellent for scrolling documents or zooming pictures in an intuitive way. The processor / RAM / SSD combo make it very fast. The screen is bright and has a \"glassy\" feel to it. The keyboard is very \"clicky\" and comfortable. The laptop physically feels very \"solid\" and not cheap and plasticy. Cons- I will caveat the cons with theyre all to be expected based on the item description- and when you consider the price (I paid $525) its well within expectations. The resolution is not \"real\" HD- its 1366x768. The fan can be a bit loud at times, not obnoxious \"ten year old Pentium laptop\" old- but a bit louder than you'd expect for something this modern. The integrated graphics is pretty meh. I got a few older but still modern games like Fallout 4 and Deus Ex to play okay but this definitely isn't a gaming laptop. Bottom line is- if you are looking for something really good for school or business, and don't really play games- this is awesome. If you need something more- you're getting what you pay for- go get a more expensive laptop."}, {"name": "Reach_Medic", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2020", "title": "A solid budget PC", "review_text": "This is a solid budget PC.

When it came, I could not apply a screen protector whatsoever. Mainly because this unit already had a screen protector on it. 4 to be exact, so this tells me right away that this wasn\u2019t brand new. When I booted it right, right away had bubbles in the screen. So I had to remove the screen protectors to stop it from bubbling up. The performance of this laptop or chromebook is sluggish and slow. The set up was so simple that I didn\u2019t have to do anything really, just type my email in, and everything transferred over like that. When I typed on google docs, Netflix or a random app would start up mid session while typing, which was a hassle. You cannot whatsoever put mobile network on this and solely runs on WiFi. If you use mobile hotspot it isn\u2019t the most trust worthy as it constantly booted me off. When I tried Google Stadia on this, for the most part it ran well, but with mobile hotspot at McDonald\u2019s it stuttered a lot. And off of mobile hotspot, couldn\u2019t play whatsoever. If your planning on gaming on the go, with a mobile network, you will be sadly disappointed if wanting to take this on a dirt road away from WiFi. This is good for Someone who will stay at home or has a great WiFi connection constantly. You can download Netflix movies and watch them without internet, but the sound is awful, and the resolution isn\u2019t the greatest being sluggish and all. The overall feel of this laptop is there, but it doesn\u2019t allow certain things to work on it. This isn\u2019t windows remember, so your awesome headsets or gaming mouse, may not be compatible with this chromebook. Although it looks really cool, to use typing as a writer, I would not recommend it. Typing words sometimes pauses mid type, and doesn\u2019t respond causing the device to freeze then come back to life again. Not the best device out there for sure, and would recommend not picking it up, unless you are literally not going to take it anywhere but home."}, {"name": "NCWAkk!zkaks!sz xkkeod", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2020", "title": "Light and Sweet", "review_text": "So cute and it\u2019s PINK!!

I was looking for a laptop that I can use for work, travels easy, but can afford me some game time when I am on the road.  Budget wasn\u2019t really an issue, but I wanted to make sure I was getting the most value for what I spent.  I do not do intensive work applications on it just email, excel, general surfing etc.  I am not a competitive gamer, so getting that extra millisecond of response time was not a concern but I wanted something that could handle current games and most games that will come out over the next couple of years. What I considered / compared it too? GPU \u2013 GTX 1650 \u2013 this thing rocks, most comparisons were to the older (but still capable) 1050i and other variations.  I wanted the newest I could get for the cost.  So this was the bench mark of my search. Processor \u2013 9th gen i5 \u2013 I really wanted to get a 9th gen i7 but, most of the ones that had it only had the 1050 series of graphics card, and as I stated above that\u2019s what I really valued most. NOTE: Lenovo DOES make a version of this with a gen 9 i7, it is not available (at the time of writing this) on Amazon. It IS available on Lenovo\u2019s website for about $180 more than this unit (on sale for $270 off ATM), but it comes with a smaller SSD.  I know its easier to replace an SSD than a GPU (basically impossible on a laptop like this) but between the cost difference and not having to hassle with adding an SSD right when I received it, that\u2019s why I decided against that route. NOTE: the benchmark testing on a gen 9 i5 vs i7 were very close in most tests, while future proofing your purchase is a good idea, it didn\u2019t look like a big enough difference (4 cores 8 threads on the 5 vs 6 cores 12 threads on the 7) to move me to spend more. NOTE: This laptop model might be an Amazon exclusive because I could not locate it on the Lenovo web site. Monitor refresh \u2013 60Hz \u2013 this was a tough one for me, there are some laptops that have the 9th gen i7, 16gb ram and the 1650 graphics card with 144Hz monitor (and there is a difference, just watch some youtube videos on it) but that cost difference was about $450.  For the games I play (will get to that in a second), the look, and the weight of the product, I just couldn\u2019t pull the trigger on the extra costs. RAM \u2013 8GB \u2013 documents state that you can upgrade the single 8GB stick to 16GB. 16GB DDR4 is about 70 bucks, if I get into a game that is giving me performance issues, I am ok with that upgrade cost. NOTE: Lenovo says you should use an authorized tech to upgrade your RAM/SSD or you might void the warranty.  I am not sure of the legality of that due to the right to self-repair, but I have done enough that it doesn\u2019t concern me, your views/value my differ from mine in this respect. 512gig SSD \u2013 I definitely wanted an SSD, boot speeds etc are totally worth it. 512 means I can fit about 6+ of today\u2019s modern games on it comfortably.  I am ok with that for now.  It does have an extra 2.5\u201d bay for another SSD (I have a 1TB from my old laptop so if I get to the point where I need it, it won\u2019t cost me anything extra, obviously your experience will differ from mine in that additional cost).  The extra bay is nice because you do not have to reload the OS etc, you can add the drive and increase your storage easily.  The NOTE above on the RAM upgrade applies here too. The Look \u2013 As I mentioned I will be using this for work too, this is as discrete of a \u201cgaming\u201d laptop as I have seen.  I did not want flashy lights or gaming brand logos on the cover.  I have the power to game; I don\u2019t need or want to flaunt it in my day job interacting with customers. Keyboard backlight \u2013 has 3 settings, off, low, high.  I play in a pretty dark room and the low setting was perfect to let me see while not blinding my peripheral vision. Heat \u2013 this is not a loud laptop (fans); I have been gaming on laptops for 10 years an have had my fair share of jet engines.  This doesn\u2019t appear to be one of those.  It does get warm, but nothing of concern or that would burn to the touch. Battery life \u2013 I haven\u2019t tested it yet completely (will update when I do) but in \u201ceconomy\u201d mode (not using the 1650 graphics card) it looks to last 5+ hours, the description says 9 hours but I doubt that, still its more than enough for when I can\u2019t plug in.  Running with the 1650 turned on and gaming I would get around 2 hours. Bloat \u2013 amazingly it didn\u2019t come with much on it that I had to remove.  MacAfee and a Lenovo thing, that\u2019s about it. What games do I play on it? No Man\u2019s Sky Beyond \u2013 Played on high settings with no issues/lag/clipping at all WoW \u2013 Ultra settings with no issues (obviously its an older games graphics wise) Overwatch \u2013 Ultra Settings with no issues As I play and test more games ill update this\u2026.. 9/29/19 EDIT - Borderlands 3 - 30 FPS on Ultra, dialed back to medium and was more than great for my average gamer needs. 11/30/19 EDIT - Thrown a ton of games at this over the past few months.  Basically anything made before 2018 you can run at max with no issues.  Most newer games (2019 releases) will run just fine at med/high settings. What about the backlight/bleeding reports? Ill knock on wood, I have not seen bleeding on the edges for darker games, or I might just not be noticing it.  backlight/monitor darkness, again, I have not experienced this, and I hope I don\u2019t.

The i5-9300h will pretty much be able to do anything except for the heaviest tasks, while the GTX 1650 can handle a large variety of games, though the most graphics intense games will need medium to low settings. While there are only 8 GB of RAM, in my usage (internet browsing, college work, occasional gaming) that has never been a problem. Again, this isn't the absolute most powerful laptop, but it is probably far above average in performance. Battery life is surprisingly good for a gaming laptop, especially if you undervolt (which I did by -125 mV if you're interested), and it runs relatively cool as well, rarely going over 80 C. I personally really like the minimalist design, with blue accents instead of the \"gamer\" red, so this won't turn too many heads in a professional meeting. The screen bezels are relatively small too, and while apparently the color gamut is not the best, that either doesn't matter or isn't even apparent to me (in case you saw reviews criticizing this). Maybe if you're in graphic design, this might matter, though. The hinge is strong, and can bend all the way to 180 degrees. It's not a touchscreen laptop, but there are some uses, such as watching a video in bed or something. The system is also really slim for a gaming laptop, and easy to carry around, which is an excellent design choice. The build quality isn't the best, being mostly plastic, but it is still smooth to feel, so there is at least that. The keyboard isn't very clicky, and the travel distance is a little small. It takes a while to get used to, but eventually you may get used to it. The backlit keyboard is nice, though. The trackpad unfortunately uses garbage Synaptics drivers. I played around with the registry a bit to add a couple gestures, but coming from Windows Precision, the trackpad is definitely a massive downgrade from Precision for me. I tried installing Precision drivers, and they worked (excellently, I might add) temporarily, because I guess Windows update has something in place to really latch you on to Synaptics drivers. Although there are definitely some sacrifices made (including some that I haven't mentioned, such as needing to buy a separate cable if you want to add a hard drive or having only one slot for RAM), I think that on balance this laptop provides fantastic value for $680. In some areas you get what you pay for, but for $680 this laptop can do a lot more than others."}, {"name": "kiet vy", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2019", "title": "single channel ram slot", "review_text": "Overall decent laptop for the $700 range, you get what you paid for.

I didn't test it in much games, All I have tested is Total War Warhammer II and it has stable 50+ FPS on ultra settings. With these specs I think it is a good deal.

Upgradability: - Processor is soldered to system board. - There is only one slot for RAM. - There is no bracket and cable for additional hard drive and I couldn't find spare on Lenovo Parts Finder. My huge complaint is about Lenovo Representative who answers questions here on Amazon. Answering questions he said that there is extra slot for additional RAM stick. Here is the link to that answer: https://www.amazon.com/ask/questions/Tx1QTL71H6BKS5Z/ref=ask_dp_dpmw_al_hza. That is a lie. There is no additional slot for RAM on this board. There is only one slot with 8 Gb stick installed so if you want, like me, upgrade this Laptop to 16 Gb of RAM you need to buy 16Gb stick. I'm very disappointed by this because after I read Q&A section I ordered another 8Gb stick along and now I stuck with 2 extra 8Gb sticks after I upgrade laptops memory. Also, Lenovo Rep mentioned couple of times that laptop is not user serviceable. I don't know why did he said that. Bottom cover is held by 11 screws and comes off easily, after you slightly pry latches. (2 for each side spaced evenly) and there you have access to RAM, coolers (in case you need to clean them) and SSD. ( By the way there is short version installed, but it is possible to install long SSD stick, as it has screw mounts for different sizes). You can find service manual with diagrams on Lenovo site in support section. Finally I want to recommend to undervolt your CPU and GPU. BUT ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DOING.

Given the specs, the battery life is expectedly low - but honestly fairly decent for what you get. If you're not doing anything intensive it can easily last 3-4 hours. Linux compatibility is great as well - The hardware is all supported by current open source drivers as well - save for the dual head mode on the GPU, you will need to install the proprietary nvidia-driver-430 or newer if you'd like to use a secondary display along with the built in panel. My only major complaint is that the USB-C connection does NOT support HDMI over USB. It's only a Gen 1 USB 3.1 controller and outputs just 5Gbit/s - far short of what's needed to drive a monitor or two. The built-in HDMI connection works just fine, but I'd have preferred the ability to use an all-in-one dock so it's a bit disappointing for a newer generation laptop to have such an old USB controller.

It's a nice looking laptop. It's a modest looking laptop without much of an obnoxious \"gamer\" look to it. The build quality on it feels nice and the keyboard is good. It also comes with a little privacy shutter for the camera. The touchpad on it has some issues, which I'll get to later. I initially bought this laptop for its specs. The i5-9300H that it comes with does quite nicely with a lot of the stuff I work with, especially emulation. It also comes with a GTX 1650, which pairs well. Unfortunately, it only comes with 8GBs of RAM. It only has one RAM slot, which makes upgrade options limited and preventing dual channeling; I only know this from word of mouth, and I can't verify it myself as I don't want to void my warranty by opening my laptop. Now, onto some minor nitpicks. The screen is a bit dark, although it's not too much of an issue for me. The sound quality on the speakers are decent, but not that great. The battery life is also okay; it gets about five hours with casual usage, and a little under an hour with gaming. The performance on this laptop is also reduced when on battery, so you might as well keep it plugged in when gaming. The F1-F12 buttons have some functions assigned to them (adjusting volume, brightness, etc.), which get in the way sometimes. It's annoying when I try to press Alt-F4 to close a window only to have it mute the microphone instead. Luckily, this can adjusted in the BIOS so that you have to hold the FN button to use these functions (which should've been the default setting in the first place). Now, onto the biggest issue. The touchpad is absolutely horrible. It's hard to describe, but the momentum on it doesn't feel right. When I try to transition from moving slowly to quickly, the mouse doesn't follow my finger quite right; it's hard to move precisely because of this. I do have a USB mouse on hand, but I honestly prefer to use touchpads, which is why this is such a nuisance for me. It's not even a hardware issue either; it comes from the lack of implementation of Windows's precision touchpad drivers. Lenovo could've issued a simple software update to fix this, but they refuse to do so. If they do fix it, I'd be perfectly willing to up this to a four star review. Bottom line, get a USB mouse if you're going to buy this laptop. Now, while we're on the subject of purchasing, I believe the original price point for this laptop is somewhere among the lines of $800-900. The specs are great, but I can't recommend it at that price because the design cuts too many corners on a lot of the peripherals (especially the touchpad). It seems like Amazon is selling them for a little under $700, which I suppose is a much more reasonable price."}, {"name": "Steven", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2019", "title": "Works great!", "review_text": "A superb gaming laptop, but I actually bought it for engineering grad school.

The only reason I am giving this product a review that is good (I usually only review products if I have something bad to say) is that I feel it is misrepresented by the bad reviews. Only a small portion of the reviews for this computer are negative, and more people who have bad luck will leave reviews than those who have good luck. So consider that before you think that the 20% of reviews that account for this computer not having a 5 star overall score make up probably 5% or less of people who actually had issues with this computer after purchasing it. Ok, on to my review This computer is better than any other that I have used or owned before it. Thats not saying much because I got it as an upgrade  to a  10 year old macbook. However, some of the reviews complained about the screen not having good color, and I dont really think thats true. Also, there were complaints about the keyboard, which feels really good in my opinion, and about the flimsiness of the plastic that its made of. I understand that a computer with an aluminum shell would be better, but that is expensive and heavy, and the plastic that lenovo used doesn't seem flimsy. Cosmetically, I love the computer, and the screen seems very good quality. The main reason I wanted this computer was for editing with premeire pro, which I could not even use on my old computer. Premeire runs very well, and I have installed a few games on it as well which I feel might help some people make desicions about whether it is \"beefy\" enough for their gaming needs.  I have been running forza horizon 3 with max graphics settings, and the framerate average is around 50 to 60 frames per second, which is better than I expected for a $700 laptop. The other game I have been running, which some people might be less familiar with is the drone racing league simulator. This game, when on max graphics settings, has realistic lighting and amazing amounts of detail, and I have had no issues running it at 60 fps all the time with max graphics (the game is very fast paced so it has a framerate warning if you drop below 60). I can't give an accurate estimate as to battery life yet, because I've only had it for a few days and haven't tested the battery yet. I would guess that you could probably get 5-6 hours if you are web browsing, and 1-3 hours gaming, depending on how demanding the game is.

I eventually settled on this laptop and after 48 hours of use I am very satisfied with its performance. Granted I can speak for it's longevity just yet but below are my initial impressions after using it working from home and trying out some games. Pros: -It's fast. My previous laptop had maybe half the RAM and I really notice a significant performance boost compared to other laptops I've used. The startup time from powering on to actually being able to use is very quick (under 1 min). I've had several programs running at the same time with no noticeable lag. -Decent gaming laptop. I haven't run anything super intense on this machine as of yet but the few games I have played have performed very well. I was able to run Shadow of Mordor on high settings with no lag at all. When I bench tested the game it was consistently running around 80 fps. Also, It was also incredibly easy to plug in and play with an Xbox one control, no installing drivers or anything. -Very few \"freeware\" programs. This isn't something I normally think of until I start actually using a new laptop but most PCs are pre-loaded with a bunch of junk programs that slow it down and never get used. This came with barely anything pre-installed which saved me the headache of going through the program list and trying to figure out what isn't essential. Cons -Only 2 USB ports. Not a huge deal but if you use an external mouse with this laptop like I do it really only leaves you with 1 functional USB port. -Paying for a \"gaming\" laptop. This might sound like a weird complaint for what is advertised as a gaming laptop but essentially what you're paying for is the Nvidia Geforce GTX chip. I saw a number of other laptops with very similar specs that were $200 cheaper because it wasn't a \"gaming\" laptop. But still, if your main priority for getting this machine is for a low-end gaming rig it is still a good deal. Recommendation: If you are looking for a high-end gaming laptop that can play triple A titles at max specs you may want to get something with more RAM. However, if you are looking for a multi-purpose office PC that can also run games it is fantastic. Overall very satisfied with this purchase.

The battery life is miserable. I cannot expect a lot from a gaming laptop. The GTX1650 handle everything very well. Nvidia software let's you switch from Gaming drivers to Studio drivers at any time so you can use it for your Adobe suite and return back to your daily gaming activities lol. BE ADVISED: the video presentation of the product might make you believe that the lid's backside logo and the logo next to the keyboard are retroiluminated, but they are not. The keyboard is very soft. Nice to type. I enjoyed the mousepad. I saw complaints about it, but seriously?? Well, just get a mouse. I have mine also. The screen is big and bright. Everything is very clear. Windows flows nicely on this machine and I can't regret making this purchase as long as it lasts and I surely can't see this laptop failing. The only bad thing: McAfee.

Not bad overall. So why 3 stars? Something appears to be wrong with the WiFi adaptor. I purchased this laptop a few days before a competitive event with cash prizes, for the specific purpose of using it in said competition. This was when the WiFi issue became noticeable. At an unpredictable pattern the latency spikes, the game stops interacting with the host servers, and you can't do anything. The computer is not frozen, you can minimize and run other tasks just fine. The game itself is not frozen, other players are playing just fine on the same servers without issue. It seems to be the onboard WiFi adaptor itself. So I sent a support case to Amazon. They asked a few questions, concluded I had received a defective product, and gave me a shipping label to exchange it. (Downside: No laptop during competition) New laptop arrived a few days later and still has the same issue. This leads me to believe it's not a defective product, but more likely a low quality WiFi adaptor onboard causing the issue. I now use the laptop for less time sensitive tasking. I may end up buying a USB WiFi adaptor later and seeing if that results in better performance. The drawback there is that there are only 2 USB ports on the laptop. I usually use one for my mouse and one for my laptop cooling pad, so I'll have to figure something out there.

It's not been an issue with 15 years of multiple personal and work laptops of every brand. So to say I'm frustrated right now is an understatement. I *think* the solution is to uninstall the bad touchpad driver it came with and reinstall a new one, but not being a tech person I'm paying to bring it to someone who is so I don't break anything!

Still, this laptop is awesome!! Rating: 5 Stars (because 4.8 isn't an option and 4 is too few for this thing) Model: 12 GB RAM; Ryzen 5 3500U Pros: > That price! (Unmatched in performance in this price range!) > Ryzen 5 3500U performs better than the Intel Core i5-8250U. > Vega 8 graphics are fairly capable. > Backlit keyboard is nice and a pleasure to type on > Light and portable > Great port selection. > 12 GB of RAM is sufficient for most daily tasks. (Expandable to 20 GB if your the warranty voiding type) > Decent sound for its class > Comes with a pen that works very well with the software > Great touchscreen Cons: > Can't charge via USB-C (Lenovo! Please do this for the next model!!) > Screen brightness is sufficient, but not suitable for outdoor use. > Pen stores very awkwardly (Lenovo! You can really do better!) > McAfee preinstalled, and it resists being uninstalled. (You actually need to download their uninstaller to do it. IMHO its more of a virus than an antivirus.) > Battery life is definitely OK. Its not a super long lasting battery but I seem to get 5 hours out of it at a time (in balanced mode and dimming the brightness a bit - honestly, you get what you pay for. My take: I bought this laptop for graduate school. I wanted something I could use to take written notes as well as use to do all my assignments. It needed to be portable, fairly lightweight, all while not compromising on performance. This laptop fit my needs on paper. Now, after using it (practically daily) for a month, I can say its a pleasure to use. It boots up in seconds (like less than 20), and has a lightning fast fingerprint sensor. My other laptop is a Thinkpad X1 Extreme, which I intended to be a powerhouse (32 GB RAM, i7-8850H, 4K, GTX-1080Ti Max-Q). Honestly, this laptop puts my \"powerhouse\" to shame in many ways. The Flex 14 boots up QUICKER, has less graphical errors when switching between desktops, and has a brighter back-light on its keyboard. Of course the Flex 14 can't run a virtual lab environment comprising of 4 machines like my Thinkpad Extreme, but it sure can run 2 VMs simultaneously (at least on the 12 GB RAM config). This laptop is SO good for the price I'm honestly shocked that it is not listed in the best laptops of 2019 list on YouTube or Google - its really a great find. Thank you Amazon! TLDR: This laptop is amazing. If you're a student, someone who seeks a 2 in 1 experience, a person who doesn't want to pay $800+ for a laptop and needs something portable yet powerful enough to get actual work done, this is the laptop for you."}, {"name": "Atarkiss", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2019", "title": "Refurbished", "review_text": "I received this computer on Thursday, marked brand new. 20 minutes after setting up part of my screen glitched up and became pixelated.

The material is mostly plastic but I appreciate that for the reduced weight. This is my first Ryzen machine, and I am mainly using it to run a Citrix environment (cloud-based VM). Today will be the first full 8+-hour day using it. The power brick is not excessively huge. About the width and height of a standard post-it note, and 1\" thick. The cable is over 5' (my measuring tape only goes to 60\") closer to 6'. It has a barrel connector so unfortunately, it is not easily replaceable with a USB C cable (next model, pretty please?) The keyboard is backlit, which is nice for the darker surrounding often found in my home office. Typing is okay, but there is a noticeably shorter key travel than other laptops/Chromebooks I have used. I'm getting used to it, but like with any new keyboard, there will be a small learning curve. I keep missing the home row and using the Caps Lock as the A key for some reason. I'm using it on a small folding table at the moment so that could be the reason. The screen is nice, it is a 16:9 full HD screen, and for me, I prefer 16:9 to the new standard of 2:3 (more of a square). It is not bright though. Not at all. Even with the curtains open, there are times when I am still trying to get more brightness out of this display. It's not unusable, but forget trying to use it outdoors. Touch is fine and works. I did not buy this to use as a tablet though but Windows 10 has some processing going on in the background that makes it easy to hit small buttons in applications without being terribly accurate. The pen is interesting to me as it is roughly the size of a real pen [*cough* Samsung*cough*] which makes it easier to draw/write with without immediately cramping my hand. The Dolby Audio on the speakers leaves a lot to be desired. Some tweaking was needed to get the overblown sounds to subside. During the initial setup, it was hard to listen to. Turning Dolby Audio off though somehow reduces the speaker volume by 2/3... Not the actual volume percentage, but the actual sound. Dolby is using some sort of gain control so 20% volume sounds more like 40%. 4k video on YouTube looks great and only dropped 3 frames in a 2:44 video (Borderlands 3 FLAK FTW!) but that could have been from me trying to make it full-screen.  I have not tried any games yet, but I did install Diablo 3, and World of Warcraft Classic. If anyone is interested, I will update this when I try them. With the Vega graphics, there is an automatic 2GB reduction in RAM availability. Couple this with the 8GB model and you are left with 6GB to run Windows 10 and any applications. Budget for the 12 GB model unless you are A) skilled with laptop hardware, and B) don\u2019t care about the warranty. I\u2019ve seen the tear-downs, and there is an open RAM slot. I usually don\u2019t tear open electronics until a year after I own it (unless there is a reason to do so). The WiFi issue that is detailed on the 8GB model is non-existent for me. I feel like I may be more qualified to test that as Citrix requires a constant network connection and gives an immediate alert if connectivity drops for more than a couple seconds. No issues here, running the latest Windows updates. Overall I\u2019m happy with this laptop, It is much lighter than my 15\u201d Acer Predator and looks a lot more professional when traveling for work."}, {"name": "myReviews", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2019", "title": "Engineers should be ashamed of this device.

Pros: -Uses SSD, so it's fast. -Hinge is pretty sturdy after a few days. -Good keyboard layout. Cons: -WORST PEN AND PEN HOLDER IN HUMAN HISTORY. I can't get over how stupid this thing is. The holder is the worst: it takes away one of 2 full-sized USB ports itself, but if you want the pen to stay in the pen holder, you have to go horizontal which blocks both USB-A ports and the pathetic SD slot. Pen eats AAA batteries; why is it not rechargeable? It's supposed to be able to be stored vertically but the hole where the pen tip is supposed to rest and fit the pen tip in for stabilization is too far down and the pen just pops out. The pen is accurate but of the two buttons it has, only one seems to work (the right click). The other one seems to be there for decoration or confusing people. Absolute garbage. -SD card sticks so, so far out of the SD card slot: it's around 60-70% exposed. You will snap one of those eventually if you aren't super careful. I haven't, but I've only had it a few days. Why even have it if you can't even make sure the card isn't somewhat protected? -SSD is small. Only 256GB. -Various software issues including flickering and not being able to download apps, not being able to do side-by-side multitasking. -McAfee and Lenovo bloatware. Please **** yourselves for putting that in there. -Awful documentation. I had to go to the Device Manager to identify the NIC. Their own website doesn't even list it on the \"full\" spec sheet. -It didn't even run Netflix in Edge. It's a Windows machine that can't even do Netflix out-of-the-box. -I couldn't even install Linux Mint or Debian on it because it couldn't identify the Realtek NIC.

In truth it would have taken 1 month for anything to actually be fixed Did some research and found it faster and cheaper to buy a completely new wifi card (Intel 9260 no vpro), and installed it myself.

Nearly any laptop can do that, but this one does it quite well for the price. I was looking for a laptop similar to the Surface Pro, or Surface Go. With the necessary accessories (i.e. pen and keyboard) both Surface products cost well over the price tag of this laptop, and even come with lesser specs. This CPU (Ryzen 3500U) is incredible for what I need this laptop for. As an engineering student, I'm certain it could handle programs like MATLAB, SolidWorks, and AutoDesk products.  Vega 8 graphics are good for regular use, but I wouldn't use it for gaming as I wouldn't want to max the thermals out, but Minecraft and Rocket League would run on low-medium if you absolutely need to. The laptop comes with a pen and USB holder for the pen, and the pen works great. It allows me to use my laptop as my notebook for all classes. Maybe this laptop is for you, and maybe you need something more higher end. PROS: -Sharp 14\" 1080p screen with great colors and great pen accuracy -Battery life easily lasts me 7 hours of use and the charger is very portable. -Slim, light form factor -Very fast, but it is new so I would expect that since it has an SSD. CONS: -Get the higher RAM model, the embedded graphics uses 2 GB of whatever RAM you selected and 6 GB is not enough for school use, 10 GB is though. -Keyboard has a very short travel, takes a while to get used to -Touch pad is mediocre -Pen sometimes has issues with the barrel buttons, very minor gripe. -Build quality is okay at best. Lots of plastic, some flex on the chassis and keyboard, but again, it's relatively cheap. No idea about the longevity of this laptop, but I guess I'll find out in the future. Mine shipped with a year and a half warranty so that is nice.  All-in-all, if you're on a tight budget, this laptop (Ryzen 5 3500U and 12 GB ram) will work great for school.

Time of ownership is only 2 days, so I can't speak to long-term reliability. Build quality appears to be good. Performance: No complaints. Handles light multitasking without stuttering. Haven't performed any heavy productivity tasks, but I expect it would do well. Specs are as advertised. SSD is a TLC Western Digial PCIex4 NVMe M.2 drive with respectable performance (see pics with 3GB/1.6GB read/write speed). Everything appears to be new, as it had zero 'on' hours before I started using it. RAM is dual channel, even though it is an non power-of-two configuration. This helps with GPU performance. I played a demo for Forza Horizon 4 at lowish settings and fairly smooth gameplay (30 FPS). Screen: Touch screen works very well. I got a screen protector and applied it immediately, thinking that the screen would come dust-free from the factory. This was not the case - make sure you wipe down the screen, even if it is brand new! My son enjoys using the pen to doodle, and I anticipate using it for annotating documents used for teaching. Screen is bright enough for me. Battery: I suspect that some of the complaints about the battery may have been from users getting the Windows 'estimate' of battery length during periods of heavy processor usage in the first couple hours of Windows updates, etc. After all Windows updates and installations have completed, with normal web browsing and settings optimized for battery life, Windows is telling me I have roughly 14 hours (see attached pic). With battery settings at top performance and screen at full brightness, it is reduced drastically to ~5 hours, as expected. Sound: Sound quality is adequate. Not impressive, but it gets the job done. Misc. I noticed that my WiFi speed was capped at around 10Mbps, but only while I was on batter power. I changed a setting on the WiFi adapter power management (see attached pic), and the problem disappeared. I have had no problems with WiFi disconnects. Lenovo Vantage has a setting to limit battery charge level to ~60% in order to improve battery longevity - I like this! It is easy enough to disable if I am going on a road trip and need the full battery length. Keyboard is adequate. I enjoy the backlight and have no worries about it breaking, but it does feel a little cramped. Fingerprint reader works well. Camera image quality is sufficient for video chats.

Light photo retouching in Affinity handled with ease. Editing 1080 video files in Hitfilm, yeah it can handle that. Rendering them isn't the fastest out there, but it gets the job done without slogging the entire system down. And gaming, while it may not look the best in some titles, is surprisingly passable with the help of the Vega graphics. I was able to get a modestly sized city built in Cities: Skylines (a very CPU/RAM heavy game) and still able to run a few tasks in the background. If it can handle all this, your average user will be able to run this without issue. The screen is more than capable enough for some light work in photo editing, but since it doesn't have any claims on sRGB coverage you probably don't want to do any professional work on it. The touchpad, while being a bit on the small size, is usable and accurate. Keyboard is pretty good for a laptop. Body is solid, no flex when resting my wrists on it while typing. The fans stay quiet most of the time, and even when they do ramp up it's not the worst noise I've heard. Almost no wobble on the keycaps and the keys have a pretty satisfying feel when activated. The fingerprint reader with Windows Hello works flawlessy and quickly. And the pen and touchscreen are decent enough for me, but I'm no professional artist, I just like to doodle and play a game of Drawception every now and then. There are a few things that keep this from being 5 stars, though. The battery life is serviceable enough that I can occassionaly pull it out and work on something without fearing it dying, but in my use I'm pretty far from that claimed 'Up to 10 Hours'. Speakers, are not great. Turning off the Dolby 'enhancements' made it sound okay for the most part, but sound does get distorted at higher volumes. You'll be better off with external speakers or headphones. The pen holder, while I do appreciate Lenovo trying to include one, is laughable. With the pen inserted in it, all ports, as well as the power button, on the right side are blocked. And while the screen stays put while typing, it wobbles considerably when using the touchscreen or drawing with the pen- unless you use it in tent or tablet mode with the screen flat against the bottom of the laptop. The last minor gripe is storage space. 250GB isn't a lot. But since the m.2 SSD is pretty easily upgradeable, and there is a 3.1 USB-C jack that is just begging for an external SSD to be plugged into it, this isn't that big of an issue. But don't let that scare you away. Lenovo has pieced together a very compelling device here with many use cases, at a bargain price.

My main gripes are with the battery life.  maybe it's the way i use my computer (lot's of video, adequate screen brightness) and the [small] size of the battery cause i can't seem to be able to use this thing for more than 3.5 to 4 hours without needing to plug it in again. I'm more accustomed to this because I've been using laptops with crappy battery life for the past 10+ years but I was hoping for a noticeable improvement with this new machine. Also, the way the speakers are situated ( below the base of the machine and towards the back)  the sound can be muffled sounding when you're holding it in your lap.  When sitting on a desk, this isn't so much of a problem. In addition, because of the mostly plastic construction, the speakers rattle bit (more noticeable at higher volumes).  Otherwise the sound is pretty clear, in stereo, and nicely augmented with Dolby software. Other reviewers have has trouble with the wifi cutting out but I haven't had that issue.  Once you get your computer, be sure to update your windows software to the latest version, then use the levono vantage software to do a check on your machine to see what else you need to update (bios software, graphics card drivers, etc).  Hopefully you can avoid those wifi connection issues by first following those steps. I imagined this computer working like a super tablet and that it does this very very well.  it's really really zippy while using day to day programs (word processor, photoshop, web browsing) and regular windows 10 navigating.  Folding the machine to it's different configurations is a lot of fun and windows adjusts to the different interaction styles automatically. 256 GB of hard drive space is tiny by today's standards, there isn't an easy way to upgrade, and only one slot for a hard drive on the motherboard. tinkering with the insides voids the warranty and lenovo reps are quick to tell you that the machine can't be upgraded by the user.  there are two RAM slots and only one is upgradable  (one 4 GB ram card is soldered onto the motherboard.  all this being said the NVME SSD makes the machine as speedy as it can be.  my suggestion is to just keep the essentials on the laptop's hard drive and invest in some decent, high capacity file storage. My model came with the active pen and it seems to work as advertised.  Kinda annoying that's it's integration is a bit of an afterthought (the included pen holder that sticks into the USB slot gets in the way of all your useful ports and is just begging to be lost) but I'm happy they included it in the package. I haven't dared to test the graphics card on newly released games (which, i read, don't run too great) but i tried the 2016 release \"titanfall 2\" running on the source engine and it runs super smooth (720 p dynamic res, 60 + frames per second).  i believe the touchscreen display does only 60 hrz at 1080 p, but it can output (via HDMI) to another monitor at 4k and a higher frame rate.  keyboard is pretty responsive and the keys have a good feel to them.  arrow keys are kinda cramp and aren't well suited for gaming.  the keys light up on this model and only seem to have 2 brightness settings.  they are adequate and do the job well enough.  though, compared to a macbook pro keyboard, there seems to be a fair amount of light bleeding through the spaces of the keys.  it's a bit hard to see the keys because of this and takes some getting used to. all and all i'm pretty happy about my purchase so far (got it at the $430, black friday discount with $100 off for signing up for an amazon credit card) and it's still a great value at the $550 range. Cons - Wack battery life (4 hour tops for high media consumption computering) Speakers sound muffled when you hold the thing in your lap in laptop mode. Speakers have a plastic rattle that's noticeable at high volumes. 256 GB of storage space is so tiny :( Pros - Lots of bang for your buck.  Probably the highest specced 2 in 1 you can get for the price. Offering the active pen with this deal adds more value to the purchase. It's very compact and versatile. The Ryzen 5 3500u's  Vega 8 handles graphics much better than similar specced Intel builds with an integrated graphics solution. Additional Thoughts:  I spent some time debating whether to get the Ryzen 7, Vega 10 model that can be found on New Egg and Costco but still decided on this one for sheer value.  Available data on comparative PC bench marks (and in computer nerd forum discussions) mention that the Ryzen 7 doesn't preform too much better than the Ryzen 5.  Vega 10 gives a marginal improvement on frame rates for most games but if you purchased this machine for gaming.....then you must really love games from 4 years ago."}, {"name": "Mary GM", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2019", "title": "Awesome laptop!", "review_text": "EDIT: The lag in krita is a well known issue.

The good: The touchscreen is good, responsive, and I am enjoying the feel of the pen it came with. The form factor is elegant and enjoyable to handle, it has a good look and feel, from the keyboard to the mouse, and of course the pen. Its also not to heavy for how big it is and what it does. The bad: This is where things get really unfortunate. The screen is ok, I have seen complaints of brightness, its not the worst in the world, but the color accuracy and vibrancy is less than desirable. The battery life will run you 4 hours AT MOST. Do not believe the 8 hours they claim, you will never get that. The AWFUL: Finally, the thing that is making me regretting my purchase, this computer is not stable, my browser crashes often when streaming video, and most video streaming is choppy, and often times low quality. The wifi is also very spotty, having spotty connection while on discord, while i stand right next to the router im connected to. I updated everything, windows, lenovos software on their website, and even re-imaged the unit several times, including the default windows 10. very little seems to fix the choppiness of not only the videos, but the actual graphical computing of the computer, even scrolling threw a web page will stutter as i scroll.

There are only three problems with it so far - short battery life and not a perfect color gamut, also a slightly large bezel on the botom (common with many laptops though) But because I've tested dozens of laptops so far, including thinkpads, lg gram, dell inspiron and XPS and Asus zenbook, I was very pleasantly surprised with the overall price/performance/featues of this laptop so far. I'm a power user and use a lot of laptops generally, so considering this $500 products beats some of the premium ones, is actually exceptionally impressive. I run Fedora 31 on this, works out of the box (including the free pen that's included) and it's great to have both touchscreen and the pen work without any further installation. This was not so with some of the other brands including LG gram for example. The laptop gets about 5 hours of wifi browsing/music listening in the background before it needs to be recharged with almost full brightness (around 280nits), this is quite average for most modern light weight laptops, but is about 1/2 short of what I got on LG gram or about 2/3 of Dell XPS or surface laptop. If battery life is important, I would suggest against buying this. Some major PROS: -good touch screen -great keyboard -upgradeable RAM and SSD, only 1 slot is soldered -good performance, equivalent to i5-8265u -better game performance than most intel cpus -excellent Linux performance Some CONS: -battery on the short end -hard to store the pen -large bottom bezel and overall bezel is kind of thick -not as light as some other laptops (but barely noticeable) Overall, this is a highly recommended laptop for anyone that needs to have a solid working machine and doesn't want to spend too much on something higher end.

I'm a graphic designer/web developer and use power-consuming software such as--basically anything Adobe. the battery life is great thus far. I worked on the laptop on battery for about four hours today and it was at about 30% when I plugged it back in. I was doing a photo edit in Photoshop, had about 10 Chrome tabs open, Excel, OneNote, Trello Desktop, and Outlook open. My biggest complaint is SSD size. 256GB isn't a lot when about 50 is used by Windows and you never actually get the exact amount of space it's rated at, which I knew that before I bought. My primary machine is my desktop, so I'm primarily going to keep the SSD clean and work off OneDrive--only syncing what I'm working on. I haven't learned the pen yet, but it works okay. I'd like more features/functions. Touch is built in Adobe Illustrator, so it's decent there. In Photoshop, however, it was a little counter-productive to try to use in tablet mode. I had to flip it back to laptop mode to clone stamp (for non-photoshoppers, you need to alt+click to select a target source). I tried to set up the pen to the alt key, but it wasn't working...perhaps I just don't know how to use it yet but that's my experience with it thus far.

Pros: - Touchscreen + Pen both work properly, although for a web browser like Firefox a couple of settings have to be adjusted for the application to support touch screen. - The keyboard is decent, not on par with Dell Latitudes or Lenovo Thinkpad keyboards but not too far from it and better than what most 2-in-1 convertible laptops offer in terms of build quality. No numpad though. - Battery life is decent as well considering this houses a low 45Wh battery. Likely due to power management working properly with the CPU since the HP Envy x360 15z (2017) with the R5 2500U had poor battery life in comparison. - The BIOS on the laptop has quite a few options such as disabling PSP (a feature I have no plans on using although I can't confirm if it actually does what it's suppose to). Most of the options I set to default although I set the laptop to performance mode when I plan on playing games. Cons: - When the Computer suspends from the battery life being very low (5%) and you resume, the touchscreen and mouse stops working until the system reboots, which is a bit of an inconvenience really, so I would keep the device above that low of a capacity if possible."}, {"name": "W. wren", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2020", "title": "Two in a row unusable....stay away", "review_text": "Hey, I researched the heck out of this and I'm a semi-geek.

They kind of play hand in hand too, since if you try to get the most out of the screen then it'll eat into the battery faster. But if you can bring a charger for when it runs out of juice, it makes up for those deficiencies pretty well. The keyboard and track pad are pretty standard for a laptop. I have no complaints. The screen can be a bit wobbly as far as build quality, and the actual base for the laptop does flex pretty hard if you put a lot of force on it. The cooling fan for when the laptop kicks it into gear can get a little loud if it's being worked hard, but it doesn't really bother me that much. It helps that the speakers are pretty fantastic in my experience and will easily drown out the fan if you crank it up. The pen that comes included works fine, but the holder is pretty stupid, honestly. It fits into one of the regular USB 3.0 ports, and it ends up blocking all of your ports and buttons on the right side of the laptop. It doesn't really affect me, but it's worth noting. The tablet mode and drawing works seamlessly for me. I'll probably be using it to take some notes, and it if ends up being annoying I'll come back and update this part. All that being said, it works really well for a general use case. The Ryzen chip does eat up 2 gigs of the RAM out of the 12 that are included, but the performance is great as a result. I think most people can get by on 10 gigs of RAM, easily. I haven't tried much outside web browsing and streaming, but some light gaming can be done with the specs here. It won't play anything modern and demanding, but there is some wiggle room for older titles or for less-demanding ones. I'd categorize this laptop as not extremely good at any one thing, but good enough in a lot of areas. And that is a great value for someone who needs a daily driver that can handle a lot of smaller things rather than someone who wants it for specific purposes (gaming, intense editing, etc).

Its fast, light, cheap, runs basic software easily; all you want in a laptop. There's, however, one tiny little problem... IT COMES WITH A FAULTY WIFI DRIVER. So here I was, thinking to myself: well no problem! If theres any wifi problems with it when it arrives I can always fix it myself. The thing is, you cant. No matter how many drivers you install, how many options you tweek and change you still CANT fix it unless you physically unscrew the laptop lead and replace the damned Realtek driver card yourself. HOW CAN YOU KEEP SELLING A BROKEN LAPTOP??? Anyhow here's the instruction on how to fix it (took me a long personal time to realize): 1. If you just bought it, you might want to return it before fixing and just buying a new laptop because the new card will cost you around 25$. 2. Purchase the new wifi network card right now!!! (since it will take time until it arrives). I purchased an Intel(R) Wireless-AC 9260 160MHz and it works great. Make sure you buy a proper intel card or else even if you replace the card the wifi will still keep dropping! (trust me I already tried it) 3. Forget about fixing the problem without replacing the card.(like installing different drivers or something like that). It wont help you, trust me I tried. 4. When the card arrives youll have to unscrew the lead. After that, use a guitar pick or something to remove the lead itself. If you dont know how to do it, go look it up on Youtube. There are black and white wires, remove them gently(dont worry about the order that they are connected, it doesnt matter). Remove the screw that holds the card and replace it with the new one. Connect the two wires( you might want to glue a sticker or something that will hold them in place because they come off very easily). Before closing the lead again, turn on the laptop. 5. Now, connect to your wifi network. Click right mouse button on the Start button > Device Manager > Theres an Unknown Device notification there > right click on it and update it(if you wont do this your laptop will randomly turn off because it thinks that theres an unknown device on your pc). After that youre done. Connect the lead back again and the screws. I hope it fixed everything for you. 6. *SMALL TIP FOR YOU GUYS*  ---- if your laptop keeps getting high cpu all the time for no reason it might be because of the Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation program. Open Task Manager and end this task( dont worry it wont do anything bad for your pc). Now your Cpu should be normal. Check the cpu from time to time to see if Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation isnt working cause sometimes it does.

I normally would just overlook an issue like this in this price range, but a friend of mine just purchased the same model and it is very quiet. So, I pursued a repair/warranty claim with Lenovo. I sent it in with very specific details regarding my concern, following their return procedures precisely. I also followed up with them to find out when it was going to be completed and reiterated the concern at that time. I was very specific with my explanation. When I received the laptop back, the keyboard still buzzed, there was a screw on the bottom that was not completely screwed in, and (the major new concern) a large scratch on the top cover of the laptop. I don't normally write reviews, but I found this significant to note. I contacted Lenovo support regarding these issues and they requested that I send before and after pictures (luckily I had taken thorough pictures before sending it in) of the scratch and the screw loose. This was sent to a separate email address that I was directed to send to over the Lenovo support phone line. I sent all of that, along with a reiteration of the original concern, which was noted as \"Overheating\" and the remedy was noted as \"Component Replaced.\" (Concern had nothing to do with overheating and what random component was replaced?). I also uploaded a video to youtube of the keyboard buzzing and the corresponding frequencies (with a link to that video in that email). I sent this email on Jan 28 and followed up on Jan 30 with no response. It is Feb 4 and I'm disappointed. I purchased a screwdriver kit to tighten the screw myself and then removed and replaced the key that was buzzing and it's better now (not completely quiet, but good enough. I think the key wasn't properly in place causing the metal connectors to buzz/vibrate).

Don't even think about using Gaming Ram with XMP profiles. Unless the base clock is 2666Mhz and not 2400Mhz. I would also suggest you upgrade to a 1 or 2TB SSD.

I really love the Ryzen 5 processor-- the specs were impressive given the price and provides plenty of power for any normal tasks. I have a gaming PC so I haven't tried any games on this... but of course its not going to keep up with a dedicated gaming laptop, but should be able to handle casual games or even 3D titles with the graphics set to lower levels. Its rather thick and bulky, but it doesn't look bad and being all plastic isn't too heavy. I don't really use the folding function, its too bulky to use as a tablet, but it might be nice for drawing with the included stylus. The touchscreen is bright and responsive and the keyboard feels natural. And the battery seems to perform decently. Its not the longest lasting but I only need to charge it every other day.  If you're not looking to jump up to the next price level for premium hardware and style, this is a great choice for the price.

I was fortunate enough to find this laptop with a nice 5 month payment arrangement. Timing couldn't have been better so I am grateful for that. I have been using my laptop for about 3 weeks now and I must say it is very snappy and rather fast for its price point. I am not a gamer so for what I do with is more leisure and minor work detail, this system is a perfect fit. I love the finger print access and the convertible aspect of turning into a tablet. Cosmetically, this laptop has a very clean and simple appeal to it. I am a minimalist so I don't need designs or bells and whistles in order to achieve what a laptop should do for me. This one is just fine. I also find the light up keyboard to be perfect feature for night time access. Overall, this is a perfect laptop for me. The only disappointment would be the claim that this is a 14\" display. It is true but at the same time not true and it is really unfortunate. While the display is 14', the actual display real estate is 13\" because there is an inch of the screen that is black and really doesn't serve a purpose other than it just being like a border. It really doesn't make sense to me why Lenovo has designed their screen this way. It is rather deceiving to say the least. For this reason, this is why I gave it four starts. I am able to get past the design flaw and I am hoping that I can get years of use out of it like my Macbook. If not, it's ok I suppose. The price point didn't break the bank at least.

Since I write a lot, this issue with the keyboard has been very annoying. The battery life is horrible, and I've never gotten near the 10-hour mark even when I do basic web browsing stuff with no other programs or apps open. Also, the battery doesn't charge up to 100% and the computer shuts down when the meter says there's still 5 or 6% left. I've experienced WiFi connection issues, but those appear to have been resolved (at least for now). I expected more in the audio department; the sound easily gets crackly, unfortunately. More of a minor issue--there's no convenient place to store the pen, which looks like it is more of an afterthought in the design process. I like Lenovo brand, but it looks like there were a lot of shortcuts taken with this model. I almost returned it within the 30 mark, but I was just too busy to take care of it. I'll have to deal with it for at least 1 year because of my budget, and I wish that I would have spent another $100-200 to get more quality. ~~BY THE WAY, Lenovo would not let me post a review because the timeframe they set has passed.

I actually recommended this laptop to my sister, and seeing how well it functioned got me to buy one. The combination of processor, build quality, and features make this laptop an incredible value. The Flex 14 does have some downsides, like the ips screen which has an okay contrast ratio and poor color saturation. But that's really it. The keyboard is very comfortable, the trackpad feels quite nice, the pen works incredibly well, the folding feature is intuitive and works well, the battery has okay longevity, and more importantly, charges very quickly with the compact included charger. This new laptop and its charger combined weigh a pound less than my last laptop. For performance, at stock settings, the ryzen 5 3500u is relatively unimpressive. It's moderately slower than the Intel cpu, and a bit more power efficient. However, in use, I noticed that the fans stay incredibly quiet, and that the chip itself never goes above 65\u00b0 in synthetic load. So, by tweaking the power limits up a bit, I was able to increase the fan speed, get core temps up to 75\u00b0, and boost multicore CPU performance by 40%. This also improved gpu performance by 15%. With this tweak, the Flex 14 is unbeatable. This laptop easily performs well into the $1000 price range, and I recommend it to any college student.

I have a Macbook that I use for work, but I have always preferred a PC.

I did some shopping around (online, but from different stores - Best Buy, HP, etc), I looked at tech websites that review laptops. I thought about getting a Surface, but I wanted more storage space. I kept coming back to this one. At first I was going to spend about $850, but then I decided that I don't need to spend that much for my needs (Office suite and browsing on the internet). I also was dead set on getting a laptop/tablet combo. This Lenovo is PERFECT. I am so happy with my purchase.

I was amazed how well it streams my Xbox games. Games like RDR2, ACO, and The Witcher 3 play great and look good. Maybe not as good as my 65 inch Samsung QLED but very good.

Very upset with this product now. The basics all work fine, but there seems to be a well-established issue with the AudioSmart feature that comes with this device which conflicts with audio controls in Zoom calls. It turns off your microphone on EVERY Zoom call in the first minute or so. You can manually turn it back on, but it is a PAIN IN THE ASS to do every single time, and there is no fix forth coming.

If you want to buy problems with no help, go ahead an get yourself one of these! Here's some original feedback I gave: \"I did not expect that I would want to use a touchscreen and I wasn't even sure I needed the 360 degree swivel, but I figured I should keep up with tech. Turns out I use both regularly and really like having these features! My biggest complaint is the screen glare [this has now shifted to the above, and screen glare is the second biggest complaint]. It can get pretty bad depending on where you sit. This is amplified by the ample fingerprints all over the screen when the glare is higher. I have been happy with the screen size I chose (14\"). It feels plenty big enough for me (for a laptop anyway). The camera resolution is pretty poor. If I need to video conference with anyone in a professional context I would be concerned about presenting in such poor resolution, especially for a job interview. However, for my current use, it's not something I worry about too much. Also, when I'm video conferencing, the audio disconnects at the start of the conference every time. I have to mute and unmute the speaker or mic every time at least once. It's quirky and could be some kind of driver conflict. Annoying, but works fine after I do that once [clearly I was not bothered by this after just one month...but this is a major flaw in my opinion now]. The laptop does come with some \"extra\" software (bloat) that I wish it hadn't and popups reminding you to do all these things you don't want to do. Hate that.

I narrowed it down between this laptop and a similar one on the Lenovo website and ultimately ended up purchasing this one as it had similar features but was significantly less expensive. Sadly, what I saved in cash I gave up in reliability. I will say that the smaller size makes the laptop easy to carry around, however it is extremely heavy (heaver than my old 17 in Dell). The keyboard keys are easy to use, I don't feel like I have to beat my keyboard to make an impression. I like the 2-in-1 feature as well--the screen is relatively easy to write on. One major issue that I have with the screen writing feature is that when I set my whole hand on the screen to write (as one does when they write) the screen will often jump to a completely different area or open a dialogue box. My biggest mark against this laptop is the subpar battery life--I'm averaging about 2 hours total before I need to plug the laptop in. I typically only have a document and a few browser windows open. I've had to resort to carrying the cord around for times I need to plug the laptop in as well as an extension cord because the charging cord itself is extremely short. I have mixed feelings about the pen that came with the laptop, I find it to be sensitive to write with. However, the way its designed does not lend itself to long term use which is a pretty big mark against it in my eyes as one of the main reasons I purchased this specific laptop was so that I could hand write notes on it. Lastly, the screen has started randomly going black and there is almost no way to turn it back on unless I plug in or unplug that charging cable. Overall, I'm pretty disappointing that I spent ~$600 on a laptop and the features that I bought it for are subpar.

But the laptop hardly detected my network because the signal was so weak. I thought that's odd!!! So I moved to my desk where my router was and connected to it. Then I tried to do video chat with someone using Google Duo but they said they could never see me bc my video was frozen or blank...but I was able to see myself with no issues so I knew the camera worked fine. Come to find out, the NIC card was the problem...i did the internet speed test and the upload/download speeds were the worst! Worse than my phone, my Fire TV stick, my tablet and basically any device in the house that connects to my wifi. Also when I moved more than 20ft away from my router, it loses wifi signal. I had to buy a USB-to-ethernet adapter to connect directly to my router to get good internet speed. I'm pretty tech savvy and tried to troubleshoot the NIC card issue by updating the driver, playing with different settings and even spoke to someone from Lenovo support to troubleshoot! Nothing worked and the Lenovo rep told me to return it and get another one. I was sooo disappointed! BTW, there is another tech savvy person on here that gave this laptop a low star review bc he was experiencing the same thing with the NIC and gave tips to simply replacing the NIC...his review was very helpful but I still decided to return this device bc I can't have something that important be faulty right out of box!

I immediately downloaded Chrome as it's my preference for internet browsers, and I had an issue where it was constantly freezing the laptop. Thankfully, it stopped after a day. Powering on is smooth thanks to the SSD, and graphics are great. Everything runs smoothly, at least after I got rid of McAfee. I absolutely love the pen an touchscreen, and I've honestly hated every other touchscreen/pen/2 in 1 combo I tested out in the adventure I embarked on while searching for a new device. If you're an artist looking to use this on the go or for basic work, this is also great. It doesn't replace a higher end drawing tablet, but if you install Krita it's a very good device to use. Pros: -lightweight -tablet mode, pen, and available -general hardware: SSD, vega 8 integrated graphics, processing abilities -sleek design -fantastic sound quality for price Cons: -keyboard feels cheap and flimsy -battery life isn't as advertised, the best i've gotten so far is 5.5 hours, not 6. The norm is about 5 hours with OneNote in use for notes in class, 3 hours running games like The Sims 4. I will be attaching photos later on. TL;DR: Amazing features for price point.

Now if you plan on using this to store pictures, videos and other files, for awhile, then you will run out of space (with the laptop alone). But with a mini SD card or a flash drives to store your files, you'll be fine. If you are a heavy computer user and need it for heavy video editing, photoshop or a heavy gamer, then obviously this won't work for you. I use windows movie maker. It works just fine. This can play light games or games that have been released from the early 2000's (if you play on Steam).. Newer games that need Gforce and what not.. Obviously not. This laptop is for the casual user, but can hold its grounds when using other programs. I have used adobe elements for video editing..

If your expectations are reasonable (i.e. don't expect to find a large screen, don't expect to run intense programs or games) then I think you will be happy with this. The notebook comes with Windows 10S (not windows 10) which can be upgraded free and easily.  If the upgrade is not made, then you are limited to the programs/apps in windows' store which is not very comprehensive.  The only issue here is that the Windows 10 version the upgrade goes to is 64 bit (not 32) which has compatibility issues with some older programs. I found the eMMC disk drive to be fast, the computer boots in a few seconds.  There is a Micro SD slot.  256GB micro sd card is only around $25 and is immensely helpful in increasing available storage (buy a name brand only; i.e. microcenter, sandisk, pny, crucial, kingston, etc etc).  The internal eMMC drive or the RAM can not be upgraded. WiFi is strong, the screen is only 11.5\" but is very bright and has very good resolution and color.  The USB ports are V 3.x.  The keyboard does not feel cramped or compromised in any way despite the small size of the notebook.  Too bad it does not have a trackpoint which would be very helpful in navigating more precisely on the small screen. I have only had this so far for a week so I can not comment on durability.  The card slot seems a bit flimsy. I have been unable to get anything near the \"whole day\" claim on a battery charge.  6 hours is about it but obviously that is still very good. Overall I believe this is a very good choice especially for this price range; this laptop is not much heavier than a tablet but is much more useful.  Also, Windows 10 is far more versatile than the Chrome OS, in my opinion anyway."}, {"name": "Shannon A", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2019", "title": "Linux mighty mouse at a great price!", "review_text": "I bought this on Prime day to replace an android tablet.

Looks good, feels as solid as one can expect, nice response feel on the keys, crisp display and bright, and lightning fast... for a reason. First things first, I ripped Windows out of this mini laptop shortly after powering it up. Why? Windows is a memory and resource hog. Secondly, the amount of information they want just to run the laptop outside Windows S mode is ridiculous. Hence, Windows had to go, so it I took it out. In place of Windows I installed Manjaro Linux, based off the Arch Linux distro, using the Xcfe interface system. Both are considered light weight and just seemed perfect for this mini laptop. The OS slid right in without a single problem, it picked up all the hardware on boot-up, and the response times proved better than I hoped. As a test of the battery, I loaded up Youtube with 15 hours of videos and let it run. After nearly exhausting the 15 hours of videos, the laptop battery finally gave up. It impressed me since it played for 14 hours and 27 minutes non-stop. Moreover, the speakers sounded much better than I thought they would. A little tinny, but what could anyone really expect? The laptop never got too warm, either, considering it is a fanless system. It just powered through without a hiccup. After ten days of regular use it seems rock solid. The shakedown period ran without a hitch. The distro comes with automatic updates, so the OS is kept fresh and update. The WiFi range is quite good. I remained connected to my WiFi for just about fifty feet, and the signal needed to pass through walls. The camera is okay, but to be honest I do not use it much if at all. I simply tested it. At just over two pounds, it travels well in my backpack and I use it during my commutes to and from the office. LibreOffice runs like a champ. GIMP runs like a champ. Audicty runs like a champ. KPatience is quick and fun. Firefox with extensions is incredibly fast... faster than on my main desktop. This is a great little mini laptop and, with the Manjaro OS changes, is worth more than purchase price. I highly recommend it since it proved so amenable to modification. I would definitely buy again. 6 Months Later... I still love this mini-laptop. I use it almost every day. Mostly I use it for writing, streaming music to a Bluetooth speaker, and a little web surfing, and I could not be happier with this machine. I made the right choice of swapping out the OS. I have recommended it to others, and I know of at least 3 other people who purchased one.

I can't find enough good things to say about this portable powerhouse. I'm a pretty hardcore gamer who also uses a lot of graphics intensive programs like Photoshop and Unreal 4. This laptop... is not for that. It's for those times away from your high-end programs, where you need 10 chrome tabs open in a coffee shop while you're experimenting with Microsoft Word layouts. It's for when you're out in the woods and want to sort and organize the photos on your camera's SD right then and there. It's for trips where you want to travel light, but still want the world at your finger tips. OK, OK, enough flowery language. Let's get to the pros / cons: Pros: -The keyboard feels great, with a nice balance of being chunky and \"clicky\" while still being compact. Once you get used to its size, it's pretty easy to get close to your fastest typing speeds with minimal errors. -This thing is really light. Maybe I'm too sued to heavier laptops, but seriously, this thing is effortless to bring around. Throw it in a backpack, tuck it under your shoulder, do whatever. This thing is pretty durable from what I can tell, so all that lightness doesn't come at the cost of having to gingerly secure it in a special compartment. Any ol' laptop bag / pocket will do! -The battery life is great! Maybe I'm too used to being tethered to outlets by more power-hungry machines, but I was able to get hours of typing and Chromeing out of this thing. The key I've found (as with most machines) is to keep the brightness a bit low when you're not plugged it, it can make a big difference. -ASUS has always made my favorite laptops and this one is no exception. If you're a fan of ASUS' work, you'll find everything you know and love about and ASUS packed into a tiny package. -The ports, lordy, the ports! So many ports in such a tiny machine. -The screen is far brighter and more colorful than I was expecting. My other laptop is a \"state-of-the-art\" ROG Strix II, with a high color accuracy, high refresh-rate display... the issue is they never calibrate said displays and they always end up coming out sickly yellow, requiring hours of manual adjusting. Not this little fighter though! Bright and beautiful right out of the box! Color pureists will notice things can get a bit washed out, but it's certainly preferable to the yellow tint of other machines. -The price is the best I've seen for the quality of machine you're getting. This thing is durable, sturdy and built for a few specific things it excels at. It's definitely given my productivity a boost and is well worth the investment. -There was pretty minimal bloatware on the machine, which was great. -Office 360 for a year is a HUGE plus. Also be sure to upgrade the machine to full Windows 10 (from S), the process is free, fast and jarringly painless. Cons: -Even 64 GBs is not a a huge amount of space. This is definitely more of a document and cloud oriented device. If you're hoping to put your entire music library on this thing you're going to need to expand the storage. If storage isn't an issue, than this is probably the book for you! -Similarly the 4 GBs of RAM can make this little engine chug sometimes. Don't expect it to be happy with running 20 chrome tabs at once,n or for it to instantly load pages the moment you click them. It's certainly fast enough, but as someone who's coming from a 16 GB machine the little differences can be noticeable. -The touch pad is ... OK. It's not terrible, but (much like all touch pads these days) it loses tracking now and then and lacks any real buttons for the left and right. I never much enjoyed touch pads to begin with so maybe I'm biased. Closing thoughts: If you like what you've read, read more reviews and honestly take the dive. If you're looking for a durable portable typer, that can do a little bit of everything this is your machine! More closing thoughts: A story for you, about ASUS laptops... In winter I got an ROG Strix II, a very powerful and very pricey machine. It was maddening getting the thing to work properly. Getting photoshop to play nice with the dual graphics. Getting the screen to not look yellow. Getting the damn speakers to not crank the bass. Many of these issues are still unresolved and frankly though I love the hardware I'm more than likely going to have to start from square one with that thing. I was all emotionally prepared to go through the same process with this little trail-blazer. I was ready to troubleshoot and troubleshoot and finally get something that mostly did what I needed. To my absolute delight, this machine seems to be the last bastion of PCs that do everything right, everything the way they're supposed to, right out of the box. I haven't had to troubleshoot a single thing about this beautiful laptop and honestly couldn't be happier. If you're looking for something portable, something durable, something to up your productivity and most of all something easy to work with, this is the laptop for you."}, {"name": "Grayhawk51", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2019", "title": "One litle Power House !", "review_text": "Ok, so you're tired of carrying around the 100 plus pound laptop when you go on vacation or need to make a presentation.

So far I'm very happy with it - actually much much happier than I thought I would be, as I've found it not to be much of a compromise in having the smaller screen. First off, it is light, though not too small in size. The display, in my opinion, is excellent; and I'm also very happy with the size and feel of the keyboard. The mouse pad is not perfect (an occasional stutter in following my finger movement) but works fine 99% of the time). I immediately added a 256mb mini-SD card so it now has plenty of storage and I also did the upgrade to Win 10 Home (Pro was not an option, but also not required for my use). It was very easy to setup so most new apps download and run from the added SD (now drive D) storage, so after downloading my main program requirements, including the Fire Fox browser and Thunderbird mail client, and several others, I still have nearly 38GB of the 64GB internal memory remaining. It is now an exact mini-version of my larger laptop as to the Win 10 Home OS look and operation and my program requirements, in all aspects, even down to my custom desktop image which was automatically transferred to this computer doing setup.

And love my 17in Omen as I do, I'm damned if that thing is going to travel with me anywhere I need to get some kind of work done when on vacation. Most of my work is cloud based, so I don't need a whole mess of hardware to run what I do. I like Chromebooks, but I did miss the Microsoft ecosystem when I used them, I found. This little thing looks to be just the niche I needed. It's dead small; I carry it around with my iPad Pro for editing photos and videos, and together they almost vanish in a bag. The battery life is pretty spectacular for the work I do on the regular. I did try, just for fun, putting some Photoshop and Lightroom projects on it, just to see how it handled them; eh - better than I thought, but definitely wouldn't recommend. Maybe in a pinch, but I wouldn't lean too heavily on it. The track pad is nothing special. I did eventually concede and buy a wireless mouse to use with it whilst on vacation, but that's probably down to my impatience on certain things. It was definitely better than some trackpads I've used, but nothing like my old Lenovo...(moment of silence for Thinky) All in all, though, I would recommend this to anyone for whom a Chromebook is a viable solution, but doesn't always go where constant connectivity is possible, so local word processing is a must. BTW, I can't really speak to how the Vivobook runs and works in S mode, like it comes out of the gate. I needed some applications that the store doesn't supply, so I switched out of it almost immediately. But I don't doubt it would work just fine, if not even faster. But I never grew fond of Internet Explorer, or the newer browser, so S mode had to go. Even so, 5/5, would highly recommend - just know what you need it for, and if it can meet those requirements.

The screen is just \"ok.\"  It doesn't seem to have great contrast even when adjusted using the Intel Graphics app for this hardware.  The display is also just not quite as crisp as other laptops I've used. By far the biggest negative is the touchpad.  It seems to randomly stop tracking when you move the mouse around the screen or try to scroll using two fingers.  Sometimes it works fine, but intermittently (enough to be annoying at every usage), it stops responding, then starts up again a second later.  I've read many discussion boards and it seems this is a known issue with ASUS touchpads.  All Windows updates are being automatically installed and it says it's up to date.  I tried uninstalling/reinstalling drivers (including the ASUS Smart Gestures app),  changing the Windows settings for the touchpad by setting it to maximum sensitivity but the problem persists.  It's not quite bad enough to suffer the restocking fee and return it, but it really does need to be corrected by ASUS.  I have no idea if it's a hardware or software issue.

The Zen will be used as my work computer in my home office. I haven't started to work from home yet so I can't comment on how it handles work tasks.  So far it has been a great little laptop while doing typical web browsing, word processing. I installed bluestacks to see if it could handle some light gaming of my favorite cell phone games and it did well. However battery life is seriously compromised when doing so and it heat up quickly, the fans stayed on. In Zens defense, this is not a gaming laptop, and I am by no means a gamer. I just wanted to see if it was capable. I'm seeing 7-10 hours of battery life on average. Nothing close to the 14hrs that are advertised. The trackpad is slick and responsive. Way more to than the Vivo. The one thing I don't like is the right side shift key is super small. I end up hiting the enter key by accident. It's not a huge deal breaker to tick off a star, but annoying. Will update once the Zen gets some work hours under its belt. For now I am happy with this Prime Day purchase. Update 8/17/2019 A couple or weeks of work under it's belt and the Zen performs well. Unfortunately, the small shift key and overall squished feeling keyboard led me to return it. I was constantly hitting the enter key in error and the arrow keys lost all functionality for me being crammed where they were. I went though two Zenbook 14\". The first was purchased through a 3rd party and was obviously an open box or refurb, despite not making that clear in their ad. Fingerprints all over the top of the case and it was missing the Ethernet adapter. I got the black screen of death while trying to update windows 10. I had it less than 8 hours and back into the box it went and returned. Pictures I added to this review are of the returned 14\" side by side with the 13\". I then purchased the Zen 14\" with screenpad and better graphics card....typing on it now...made sure not to purchase from 3rd party.  Third time is a charm ! It came brand new, no fingerprints with all accessories. It may only be nominally bigger but it's a world of difference to me. Difference in cost was $322.06. May not be worth it to some but it was to me. I am completely happy with my Zen 14. Don't think I'll really use the screenpad function but it looks cool. You won't be disappointed in the performance of the Zenbooks. I'm keeping my review at five stars as the laptop performed as it is supposed to.

It's cool that a num pad is built into the track pad, but even just the few seconds to turn on the num pad is enough for you to ignore it to just reach for the number keys instead. Also the track pad is too smooth imo, resulting in sliding across further than intended. The screen/resolution looked just a little odd to me. The screen would sometimes flicker in a way that was concerning, I was thinking something was wrong with it. Mine came with a very bad trackpad (the button part of it)--every 1/8 presses on the right button (representing a right click) would be registered as a left click or not at all!

For some strange reason, they put an NVIDIA sticker on the laptop even though it uses Intels integrated GPU, so don't let that fool you. I spent around 2 months looking for the best laptop for me and eventually purchased this one. I am pretty knowledgeable about computers and can safely say that this is an excellent laptop for the price. They keyboard is excellent and is easy to type on, with decent key travel and requires enough force where it is a pleasurable typing experience. I purchased this laptop expecting the numpad to be a gimmick, but to my suprise it works very well. Asus must have corrected the issue where the numpad was slow which caused most people to avoid using it all together. Also, to the reviews that claim the trackpad is glitchy and unpredictable, they are wrong or have an old touchpad driver installed. Overall, the touchpad/numpad are both very good and I have no complaints. The display is beautiful and the thin bezels make it an excellent viewing experience. Sharp image with good colors for a 1080p display, but nothing crazy. Speakers  are decent but you cant expect phenomenal speakers on a 13inch ultrabook. The build quality is excellent and feels very sturdy even though it weights 2.6 lbs. I have not tested the battery life but what I see online is 5-7 hours of use. The Bad: I have noticed from my brief time using it that it does get relatively warm quickly and the fan is not super quiet. Mine has a very slight coil whine but nothing too extreme. This is really the only \"complaint\" that I have this far and it really doesn't bother me too much. Overall, this laptop is an excellent choice and may be the best deal for the money. It is not perfect, but for the price, I seriously do not think you can find something better. I will update if I notice anything else. UPDATE: After using this computer for some time, I have very few bad things to say. My previous post stating that my laptop ran hot and had some coil whine is not the case, and only happened when I was setting up the computer. Since then, I have only heard the fan turn on a handful of times. The trackpad is quite small and sometimes locks up, but I also haven't updated the driver in a while so that may be my fault.

It's snappy, quick, and gets the job done in a slim formfactor with a beautiful small-bexel screen. Unfortunately, the screen is why I am RMAing my device (issue popped after Amazon 30-day return policy) and am giving this review two stars. On the minor side, there is an inconsistent screen backlight bleeding that especially visible when the display is a black color. This isn't super visible when the display is on normally, but it's definitely unusual for a screen, which screams \"cheaply manufactured panel.\" The major problem I have with the screen is that after one month of consistent use, there is a visible 1cm^2 yellow blotch on the bottom right side of my screen. This discolorzation is VERY visible and inidcates that the red and blue pixels (or magenta and cyan w/e) aren't working properly in that area. This is completely unacceptable for any screen panel. There are some good things that I do like out of the defects I mentioned. The laptop is fast and the NVMe drive it has really gives it a nice feel to it. The IR face scanner is well concealed in the slim top bezel and works quickly as expected. Battery life has been consistently decent with about 8-9 hours with moderate use. I don't do any photoediting (not my work) or gaming (it's a laptop), but performance has been acceptable overall. I'm currently in the process of geting this device fixed through ASUS' warranty service. I will update my review once the repairs to my device are complete. UPDATE: So, the entire RMA process, from shipment to and from their repair center, took about two and a half weeks. My screen panel was replaced and the new panel does not have any of the defects I saw in the first one. Overall, I'd rate the process as a solid \"okay\" for me since it was repaired somewhat quickly and effectively. Obviously, it would be optimal to not have to go through this process in the first place, but it seems like my unit was an outlier.

Nice laptop! My previous laptop was doing the slow-down, flickering screen dance to its death, so I needed to get something set up before that computer died. I use a computer for non-professional graphics and photography, bookkeeping for our family business, genealogy, all that good stuff. My last computer was pretty zippy until it wasn't. At four years old, it stopped being zippy fairly quickly and recently settled into a crawl. The Asus is REALLY zippy, and I don't mean comparatively to what I did use. I mean it's lightening. Photoshop, Premiere Pro open really fast. Paired with a portable SSD drive, thousands of photos and videos moved from one place to another with no lag. I just love that. It's a lovely looking piece. It's quiet because it's an SSD drive instead of a hard drive. (You'll want to have your files in the cloud and/or on a portable drive, is my recommendation, because there probably won't be room for your files and software.) The sound is very good (it is a laptop, so don't expect big room surround sound). The screen is clear and crisp with great color. The size and weight are perfect for my use, which is traveling a couple of times a year, otherwise using it around the house. The charging cable does have a brick, but it's a very small brick.

So, I received earlier today and I've literally had it for less than 8 hrs.  Have tried charging it and turning on.  Well, the thing never turned on.

Never seen this problem in my life with a brand new item like this, I've had tons of laptops and working in IT for over 20 years.

Overall, this is a very good computer. I was pretty surprised when I opened the box at how small it is. Yes, I should have studied the specs instead of assume it would be the same as the last one! No worry though, I like the small size and the screen size is same as before just all the way to the edges. The Good: Screen is sharp, colors are good, very happy with display quality Build is solid- seems better than my last which suffered a broken off screen at the hinge (twice!) Video playback is great at high resolutions- no stutter Sound quality was surprisingly nice improvement over my previous model- very full sound. The facial ID to log in is truly a nice feature! Thought it would be gimmicky but works very well and saves me typing in a password each time I open my computer. Ports are just right- all the things that I need and in the right places Powersupply is quite a bit smaller than my previous- that is great! I put my computer in my bag everyday and travel with it often so that is helpful. Quite- nice! Fan stays well behaved unless working on something really intense. Not much sound working in a quite living room in the evening. The bad (or at least not so good!) Touchpad- not as sensitive as my previous ASUS and with all the fiddling around with settings in the world I am not thrilled with it. It often doesn't pick up my finger movement, sometimes misreads finger movement and opens things I didn't intend- or zooms when I didn't want to. Selecting things can be hit or miss. It is still usable, but I now appreciate just how good my last one was! NumberPad- well, I guess if you are an accountant you will appreciate this feature but I am not. This makes it more of an annoyance because it will come on accidentally quite often when using the trackpad and then takes a couple seconds of attention to turn back off. When on it starts inadvertently inserting numbers into my documents so has to be disabled each time. Talked to support and they said \"they are working on a shutoff but not possible now\" Finish- It looks beautiful, but whatever the treatment on the body is it tends to really pick up finger print oils and always looks pretty messy. Have to always give it a wipe before opening in front of clients. didn't have to do this with previous Asus Overall, I would recommend this computer, just beware of a couple of the limitations going in. I am a pretty heavy user of this thing as it doubles as my work and personal computer at home so it travels a lot, gets opened and closed a lot, and is running a good 12 hours a day both plugged in and on battery. Seems like it is going to fill my needs well.

Thanks to a solid-state drive this computer boots up very quickly, opens applications very swiftly, and can handle mulpile applicatoins at once.  I have not pushed this to my usual chrome behavior (having 20+ tabs at once) but if I review this product again then I'll include that in the review. The facial recognition software is really good too and a nice feature to have on this laptop. I don't know why for this product review it asked me about touch screen. This product has no touch screen or finger printer scanner ability. The camera on this product is a potato so if you want high resolution video for recording then it's best to buy another device (webcam, use your phone etc). Doesn't have USB-C charging which is disappointing for a product in 2019. The mouse pad is a little finicky at times so be aware of that. The number pad is a gimmick and not really something you will seriously use. This computer has some ability for light gaming but honestly I would not buy it for gaming. Also, don't work on this computer while it's charging. That will help with increasing the longevity of your device and prevent fan noise which I know bothers some people. Comparing this to the 14 or 15 inch I think this is an easy purchase for those looking for a light laptop to work anywhere and not take up that much space. I have a 17-inch laptop (one I am using for review) and going to a 13 inch is so nice. Speaking of size I will warn you that some webpages (very very few) will have a hard time with adapting to the screen size and some things will look oddly cutt off.

I had it for about 2 years and the only issue I had out of it was some strange fan noise occasionally. I liked the innovative use of the trackpad as a secondary screen, the dedicated MX250 graphics, as well as a 10th gen i7 CPU. So I decided to pull the trigger on a brand that has worked well for me in the past. *The Good* The computer itself is built very well. Zero screen flex, nice rigid keyboard deck, silky smooth trackpad, and the keyboard itself has a great feel to it. The screen pad is neat, but kind of a novelty mostly. Overall performance is snappy, and light gaming can be done without it breaking a sweat. The small form factor and solid build quality make it easy to want to take it along wherever you're going. *The Bad* After two weeks of ownership, however, I have decided to return this computer for screen related issues. Within a few days of having it, I began to notice faint lines in the screen that were lighter than the rest of it. This was most apparent when displaying a solid color on a large portion of the screen. These lines would come and go, and weren't super obvious unless a solid color was displayed. I also noticed some flickering at times as well. Then, while watching Netflix the other day, the entire screen suddenly became washed out and flickery. Two restarts and a full factory reset have confirmed that it's a hardware fault and not a driver or software issue. I had high hopes for this computer, and I'm sure this is an isolated flaw in my particular unit, but a major hardware failure two weeks into ownership has me wanting to go with something else instead."}, {"name": "Sergio", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2019", "title": "DO NOT BUY, TOUCHPAD DEFECT", "review_text": "I bought this laptop because of the great reviews in multiple webpages, YouTube testers, tech reviews etc. The laptop is very good in terms of size and power.

The normal touchpad function goes back and forth between being unresponsive to selecting things I didn't intend to select.  I use it about an hour each day, max, and click on at least 5 unintended links per day, sometimes multiple in a row.  There is no touch screen to back up the terrible touch pad. My 2nd issue is that the screen dimmer doesn't dim enough.  I use my computer a lot at night when I don't need a bright screen.  Even when the screen is as dim as possible with blue shade filter on, my eyes hurt afterward.  It is just too bright for working in low light or darkness.

It's got great build quality and almost no flex at all, the thin bezels add to the look of the laptop and is a really nice touch, and the keyboard is real nice to type on. I like the rose-gold / gold above the keyboard as it adds a nice touch to the overall aesthetics, but it should've been a speaker grill instead of just an aesthetic feature. The trackpad number pad is a nice feature and I actually ended up using it more than I expected as it's right under my fingers and works great for entering in some quick numbers, whether it's for calculator, or an excel document. Windows hello facial recognition makes it much easier to sign in as it takes less than a second from opening the laptop lid, and so far I've had no issues with it. The laptop also came with a sleeve to carry it around in, which was surprising because it doesn't say it anywhere, but I'm not complaining. I love the small form factor of the laptop, because it seems like a 11-12 inch laptop at first glance but the screen is still 13 inches due to the thin bezels. Now, this laptop does come with a few cons. -The screen flickers every 10-15 minutes but is rarely noticeable, and the flickering rate isn't as high as what it was 2 weeks ago when I first got the laptop. Overall pretty easy to get used to, and I can live with it. -The trackpad sometimes jumps around or just stops working every now and then, but only lasts about a second or two. I normally use a mouse so this is no big deal for me, but it might be for some people. -The laptop chassis came warped, what I mean by this is you can clearly see a slight bend inwards towards the left of the keyboard. I didn't notice this until 2 days of having it and it was quite noticeable at first, but then I either got used to it or it fixed itself. I was pissed at first about this issue but then I came to realization that it really doesn't affect any typing. I haven't seen a lot of reviews that mention a warped chassis so I think it's a rare case. -The laptop has a USB type C port, but you can't charge through it and have to use the barrel type charger. This does affect me as I have type C on all of my devices and would've liked to have the convenience of carrying one cable for everything, but it really isn't that big of a deal. -Note that if you buy this from a country outside of the US, the charger plug is the US type and I had to buy a converter for mine. (not that big of a deal, thought I'd point it out) -Another thing worth noting about the charger, is that it isn't completely silent and there is some buzzing but you can barely hear it unless you put the power brick against your ear. I was considering buying an apple macbook charger as they make silent chargers but again, charging isn't possible through USB type C. -No thunderbolt 3: I'm not a person who takes advantage of thunderbolt 3 as I normally don't connect the laptop to high resolution/framerate displays or an external GPU, but it's worth noting if you take advantage of thunderbolt 3 -Backlight bleeding: This laptop has major backlight bleeding in black screens mostly, but is barely noticable otherwise. I don't mind it and I usually use it at half brightness anyways (it's most visible in full brightness). Now, these defects did bother me at first as I'm paying 1000 dollars for this and it comes with small issues that do get annoying when they add up, but these are compromises I can deal with as returning it really isn't an option for me at the moment as I need it for school and sold my old laptop.

When it comes to form factor and hardware configuration, I think ASUS Zenbooks provides the best value for money hands down. That said, this model is ALMOST great, but falls slightly short. These are the reasons why: 1. Trackpad does not work smoothly and freezes from time to time. Not enough to affect usage, but enough to be somewhat annoying. 2 and 3 finger gestures also not as reliable (works 85% of the time) as previous models I have owned. I use a BT mouse so it does not affect me as much personally, but still... 2. Battery life is not as good as advertised. I would say around 6-8 hours of non-heavy use (browser, MS Office plus 1-2 more programs running at the same time). 3. Fan seems to keep spinning on and off for no apparent reason, without changing/opening additional programs. Not audible during the day but at night when I am working on the bed, this can be quite annoying. 4. In previous models, the LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN keys double as HOME/END/PG UP/PG DOWN keys with the FN key. These worked great when using keystrokes for browsing/navigation (like moving between tabs, going to top of the page) and when using Office products (like moving between Excel tabs, or going to the end of sentences/paragraphs in Word etc.). In this model, the same HOME/END/PG UP/PG DOWN keys are now moved to F9-F12. This makes no sense. I now have to move my fingers all the way to the top of the keyboard to reach them, which slows me down and defeats the purpose of using keystrokes to increase productivity. As a heavy user of spreadsheets and text editors, this really irked me. ASUS - WHY  CHANGE A GOOD THING??? Especially when the LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN keys ares not paired with any additional useful functions??? This is beyond stupid! I believe most of the issues I mentioned can be fixed with a BIOS update. So ASUS, if you are reading this, PLEASE PUBLISH AN UPDATED BIOS AND FIX THESE PROBLEMS!!! And if the BIOS update can bring the FN+ HOME/END/PG UP/PG DOWN back down to where they used to be (LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN ), that would be much appreciated."}, {"name": "Boris", "rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2020", "title": "An Asus laptop with top specs that leaves much to be desired, especially if keyboard is important", "review_text": "I have owned many Asus laptops, I like the brand overall.

Although it had flashy new technological features like the touchpad which doubles as a screen, I wanted a touch-screen much mroe than a touch-screen laptop which really isn't very functional. The specs are amazing, but why doesn't the display go brigher in terms of overall nits of brightness? It also isn't a touch-screen, which almost should be mandatory for a laptop in late 2019. The specs are something to write home about, but the battery life is average, and I was having to reach for the charger more times than I liked. Another problem with this laptop was the speakers. My phone is louder than this laptop. I couldn't believe how quiet it actually was. Why build a laptop and include speakers that are not going to function well at all? I could hardly hear anything, and I was left reaching for headphones every time just to hear videos. Come on Asus, you're better than this@ But the worst feature of this laptop had to be the keyboard. Why build a quality laptop with such a tiny keyboard, with keys spaced so close together, and overall use of the keyboard was almost impossible for typing of long documents since my fingers had to be cramped so close together, making effective document editing and typing such a chore that after several months I had to return it. I now bought the HP Spectre 360, a laptop which extends a keyboard accross the entire bottom half of the laptop, includes a touchscreen which flips 360, a battery which doubles what the Asus does, specs on par to compete with this Asus laptop, and a price below that of this asus computer. It's everything I've wanted this Asus laptop to be, and everything it should have been, only much better. Loud speakers, touch screen, bright display, comfortable keyboard, lower starting price, and impressive memory features such as Intel Optane. I got lucky buying it on Cyber Monday, because now it is more than this laptop, but still worth it. They have the same footprint too. Sorry Asus, but you need to step your game up if you want to compete nowadays when other companies are producing machines leagues above your capabilities for prices under yours. Laptops nowadays deserve to have keyboards that work, speakers that are louder than phones, and screens that impress, especially with specs like the ones you include on your laptop.

To the problems: The shift key being short  is an issue and requires me to be mindful in using the right shift but that's the price you pay for incentive in compacting a laptop. Not all companies will get it right. Freezes very, very occasionally (Asus issue) so if you're using this laptop for anything mission critical I would not get this for 100% consistency. Seems to happen on heavy load.  This is, after all, a computer, and these glitches happen (but a common Asus gremlin 4 sure). Webcam sucks, don't expect anything. These issues stick out to me overall in the problems that hold this laptop back, but everything else is very good, high quality experiences. Even that IR face recognition (not as good as iPhone though). Very small form factor!

Another fix was \"go into BIOS and change XYZ\" which again, you cannot do when you have no display.  Spent HOURS on hold with ASUS, never talked to a human.

The Screenpad is an innovative design combining the best parts of a touch-pad, a macro-key add-on, and a small second screen. My only issue here is that, because you have to switch between these functions, it causes pauses in work-flow as you switch between them. This is particularly true when switching on the track-pad function to move around the screen and then back to whatever other function you were using on the Screenpad. However, the software design for these functions is excellent. There's even a quick, temporary switch to make it easier. It's only the fact that it needs doing at all that slows things down. Once you learn the ways to move things between screen and pad, it's very easy to do. I actually wish there were more Screenpad apps. (There are just a few.) But the ones there are work quickly and well. The main screen is bright and readable and the extremely small bezel makes it look even nicer. It's only 1920x1080 but for a 13-inch laptop, that's not bad. It isn't a touch screen. I caught myself reaching up to the screen to touch it a few times. Having a touch screen might have solved the issue I had with switching functions on the Screenpad. The combination of a powerful processor, a decent graphics card, and a solid-state storage drive makes this device agile and responsive. The graphics card has only 2GB RAM, which isn't enough to support use in Premier Pro or After Effects GPU-based rendering without a trick but it's enough to handle most every other task. The 16GB internal memory was great for all kinds of tasks. The port allotment for the device is excellent. 1 USB-c 3.1 v2 port, 1 USB-a 3.1 v2 port, and 1 USB-a 3.1 v1 port make it possible to connect all kinds of add-ons without a separate hub. The built-in HDMI port is very nice to have too. Finally, a full stereo out and microphone in audio jack is great to have. It also supports WiFi (though not version 6) and BlueTooth for non-wired connection. I do wish that it had a USB-c power connection since all of my existing power bricks are that type. The former standard barrel power connector is OK, but the power brick is of a substantial size. It would be nice to replace it with one of the newer, smaller GAn models. All-in-all its a great device even given the caveats above. I notice that it has a sibling model where the Screenpad is located above the keyboard and the touchpad is a separate device. I like that design better even with the $400 difference in price. Consider whether you intend to use it with a mouse all the time or whether you'd find switching between trackpad and other functions a bottle-neck. If that's not a problem, this is a good, workable device."}, {"name": "julian", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2019", "title": "Lots of wrongs with this laptop", "review_text": "I was expecting a good laptop, given that I've used Asus laptops before.

The screenpad has a bit of a learning curve to it and needs to be updated, and the settings have to be adjusted for it to work properly.  I have the 10th gen i7 13 inch ux334f with nvidia graphics 16 gig ram and 500 gigs SSD which is perfect mix for modern tasks.

Hughes", "rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2017", "title": "Solid Chromebook, but far from \"Premium\"", "review_text": "I have to start off by saying that I'm a Chromebook fan. I've tested several and owned a few. There are still apps (when I was growing up, we called them \"programs\" and \"software\") that will only run on a PC, but I try when possible to take a Chromebook with me wherever I go because they are just so damn handy. Why is this important? Because this review is not here to hate on Chromebooks. They are great little machines. Many reviews hate the OS, and don't focus on the hardware when writing their reviews. Unfortunately, this 2017 Acer Flagship CB3-532 15.6\" HD \"Premium Chromebook\" is not really \"premium.\" For two Benjamins, it's still a better computer than NASA had for all the Apollo missions-- in the space crafts and on the ground combined. But I was expecting more. I have a 2015 Asus 10\" Chromebook which outperforms this 2017 15\" Chromebook, and they were both the same price. I was hoping to \"trade-up\" but it looks like I'll keep the mini Chromebook and just use this 15\" Chromebook as a spare at the office. My Chromebook arrived refurbished, and I knew that going in when I purchased it. But sadly, mine arrived with schmutz all over the case (mainly on the bottom, and along the sides). The screen and keyboard were (thankfully) clean. But the rest of the case was honestly gross. We're talking about dirt, skin oils, and maybe food stains. I don't know what. Someone should have wiped this down with a rag before shipping it. It was absolutely disgusting to receive it with visible stains and foreign material on it. The screen quality is decent-enough. Technically, it may be \"HD,\" but it doesn't pop with color and brightness like many other HD screens. Reading emails, the text is kind of soft and fuzzy compared to my Asus PC latpop screen and Asus 10\" Chromebook. I'd give the Acer 15\" screen a 7/10 in the visual department. Again, not bad for the price, but certainly not up-to-par with other laptop screens we're now seeing. The speakers are awesome. Not only are they of good quality, but they face up! Frankly, it should be international law that all laptops have upward facing speakers so that we can actually hear them. The keyboard is excellent. Feels pro-quality, and it's not too loud (some cheap laptops have a clickity-clack problem). Could use this on a plane in first class and not disturb the blue-blood next to you with his poodle and monocle. Where this Chromebook really fails is in power. Now, I'm not expecting Cray Supercomputer here (have I dated myself yet?), but I was disappointed when I tried to run 4k video from YouTube. It was a complete no-go. Not entirely unexpected, but I was hoping a \"premium\" Chromebook could handle it. What's more disappointing is that it hiccuped a bit even on 1080 HD video from YouTube. That's no bueno. I tried watching a couple videos on this Chromebook and compared it to my PC, and the Chromebook just didn't have the mojo or gusto or eye of the tiger. In summary, this Chromebook is a good value overall, but it's far from premium. For the price, it's a worthy contended, But if you like to watch HD Netflix or other streaming film, I think I'd look for another laptop of Chromebook with better video capabilities. UPDATE: The day this refurbished model was delivered, I noticed that Walmart had brand new ones for less money. I'll be returning this used model."}, {"name": "Craig", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2017", "title": "Great Chromebook.

That means it is a laptop running Google\u2019s Chrome OS. The operating system is fast and very user friendly. One thing that people will complain about is the amount of space that the laptop comes with. It\u2019s about 15gb. Before you freak out about that, let me explain WHY the storage is so small. Chromebooks use what are called web apps. That means you don\u2019t need to (or more accurately, can\u2019t) download programs. That being said, don\u2019t expect to be downloading games and movies. The battery life is about 12 hours (unless you use the computer the way I do. I\u2019ll explain later) The camera looks good, albeit slightly grainy. Well, when it\u2019s not skipping frames. With the main focus being on web apps, that would mean that you have to be online constantly to make the most use of the laptop. There are of course, a few offline comparable apps that you can find in the Chrome Web Store if you ever find yourself without connection. If you want to unlock the full potential (and very quickly run up your memory) you can take advantage of the fact that ChromeOS is Linux based and install Ubuntu.

I don't mean that in a bad way; that's just what the product is.  I wanted something for lite to medium duty, basic everyday online activity and my work as an online tutor.  I write a lot, so a lot of online research, and watch a lot of videos I've downloaded else where.  I figured this would be good for all that, and I think I was right.  You basically have functionality like a tablet:  Everything is done by, on or through the web, including storage.  You can't install programs, this thing has no hard drive.  You CAN download apps from the Google Play Store, and you will find most of what you want for free.  I was worried that I wouldn't be able to watch videos that I downloaded elsewhere on a USB drive, but it works fine.  Haven't tried music like that yet, or ebooks....the latter of which I doubt if there is any way to open unless they were purchased on this machine. This Chromebook is light, but I wouldn't say it feels durable; I wouldn't recommend you give it the slam test to see how it holds up.  Doesn't seem fragile...but it's plasticy, and that's to be expected. The one thing I DON'T like about it is the power adapter plug.  As we all know, this is the most blatant, in-your-face, ongoing scam on laptop users and has been since the beginning:  The whole machine depends on an unsupported, usually not well insulated, it's gonna break from stress not how but when plug in the side of the computer.  The plug always sticks out just BEGGING to take a hit from something, or be the point of impact in a drop.  Just plugging this one in feels like an act of senseless optimism; it is seriously a dainty little mini-plug in a plastic housed plug in the traditional back left side of the machine.  Sooner or later, the ground will come loose inside, and that's that.  It is total BS the manufacturers don't design this better.  But, that's what they want:  When it fails, and it will, the consumer gets the blame for it, and then you gotta buy a new machine.  Can they do better?  Ever see a Mac?  The magnetic connector they use solves all those problems; anything pulls on it, it just magnetically disconnects.  Anything pulls on one of these, and you suck up your seat pants until you see if the plug or the connection has been ruined.  It's just a matter of time before I'm propping the plug up with something to make it work, then one day....bzzt.  Gotta get a new machine because replacing the charger input port is more time and trouble and money than it's worth. But, that said, virtually all laptops have that issue.  The manufacturers see it as a built in way to keep selling new machines, and the consumer can't do anything about it.  So is it fair to criticize this machine for a systemic flaw in ALL laptops (except Macs)?  Eh, you decide. Overall, I'm perfectly happy with this thing.  I did some research and knew exactly what I was getting, and it's what I expected.  So I'm perfectly down with that.  But if you're expecting the full functionality of a full laptop computer (which most people waste 90 percent of the potential of, anyway), you may be frustrated or underwhelmed.  If you're expecting a cheap, functioning Chromebook with no obvious design flaws or inherent shortcomings, you'll probably be like me:  I'm not thrilled to the point of squealing and clapping my hands like a six year old girl that just got a newest Barbie for Christmas, but I didn't expect I would be.  This thing is cheap, a good value, gets exactly the job done that I bought it for, and should last long enough to be a solid value.  Nothing magical here, just a good value, if tablet functionality with a focus on online features if what you need. Except that GD power plug.  But we're all stuck in that slowly sinking ship.

I like my apps better, but apps don't work on this thing, despite what the OS description said.  If you want to access an app or service, its done through your Chrome browser, not the androidapp. 3)  My biggest complaint about this computer is the keyboard.  The genius who designed the keyboard put the SEARCH button directly to the left of the A key.  Since there is no number pad, any experienced typer will have to reorient their typing stance from a center-left position to a dead-center position.  Its extremely cumbersome using the keyboard despite its full size.  Additionally putting the search button directly to the left of the A key is so annoying I'm actually considering prying the key off so I stop accidentally pressing it.  If that search button wasnt in such a stupidly designed location, this would be a 3 star review.

This laptop was refurbished, so I tried to save$$$. I did not see the need to add a two year 31$ extended warrenty, as this item was recently 'serviced'. It arrived quickly and in great shape, for being used. It worked just cherry from 5/15/2019 until 11/22/2019,,,,exactly 6 mo. The 30 day and 90 day return times have expired and I'm screwed. Seller and Amazon were prompt and polite with my inquiry to return this for service or attempt a refund anyway.  My issue is plain and simple,.... I find no reason why a 6 mo. old, newly serviced laptop only lasted 6 mo!!!! All I did was surf the web for information and to shop on Amazon. Never dropped it. Never spilled anything on it. Never slammed it shut. Always kept a good charge on it. One evening I was gathering thanksgiving recipes, shut it down for only about a half hour, went to finish my recipe searches and BAM the sob is DEAD. I used my reliable kindle fire 5 to find possible troubleshooting steps to follow. Yes sir,,,I screwed myself by not buying the extended warranty, but 30/90 day return warranties are geared for this situation. To force another purchase!!!!!! I will not purchase or recommend an acer product nor use Amazon for the future replacement of this laptop.

First, these are used and refurb.  With that in mind, I could not tell by scratches, dings or outward signs that this was used.  Its almost flawless.  The packaging is generic and YES it does come with a power supply, look through your box.  In about 2 hours it was fully charged and had a few updates to get.  As is with all chromebooks, the updates were fast.  Much faster than PC.  The item was about half the weight of my Windows laptop PC and this thing stays nice and cool.  I like the controls of the Chromebook, the keys are fair and the pad works very well.  Upward speakers are very nice and sound better than my PC. As I read in other reviews, this IS a chromebook and not designed for multiple open screens running multiple things.  If you keep that in mind, you will probably never have any noticed slow downs.  I started running FB, Instagram and Youtube at the same time, and it got a bit skippy.  But one or two screens without any special high demand items running and this is a fine.  The screen is awesome.  Clear, clean, HD etc etc.  The external memory add on is different from another different model I have had.  You cannot easily add to memory, though you can plug and play a memory stick or card that will protrude from the right side.  If you have high memory items to save, do it to a stick, the cloud or something else.  And, as usual, it picked up my Chrome stuff via Google supremely fast and complete.  So website history, favorites etc were all just there.  Printing set up was 2 seconds! POSITIVES: Clean sharp BIG screen Easy and fast set up Sensitive pad Like new condition great sound incredible price Battery life is very impressive (3 hours down to 73%) Fast charging Wifi super fast and easy to set up. The value cannot be understated CONS: Not great at multi tasking/heavy memory usage items.  Sure, write, presentation and regular apps.  Multimedia eats memory fast. Mostly just on line (all Chromebooks) No easy memory upgrades (unless you can open her up, but I didnt try)"}, {"name": "Mz.

I purchased a new version (not refurbished) of the computer for $159.99. I have only had this computer for about 6 months and I have had continuous problems since I bought it. Most recently, I have noticed a high pitched buzzing noise coming from the computer that I cannot figure out how to get rid of. It is extremely irritating when I am trying to work - I work from home in a quiet environment so it is easy to hear. The only thing that helps drown it out is by playing music. However! The computer is set up to have \"apps\". I downloaded the Spotify app thinking that would work but it always freezes, lags, and then shuts down. So instead I have to play from my browser using the webplayer. I have excellent internet that works quickly with all of my other devices but my internet always seems to lag on my computer. I rarely use any of my devices at the same time other than using my phone while watching streaming services. I bought this computer to use for my business, however, it has proven to not be what I need. The computer in general is slow, lags a ton, and randomly shuts off at times. I was excited about having a computer that was google chrome enabled, but that perk usually is more annoying than it is helpful. I cannot tell you how often I accidentally hit the search button on the keyboard and then it takes me out of the window that I am using. I do not have a ton of items stored on my computer - I primarily use Google Drive. So the fact that my computer is so slow despite having little storage usage is somewhat annoying. A couple of things that I can say good about this computer: 1. The size is good 2. Sound quality is overall pretty good 3. Battery life is surprisingly good 4. The computer is in general light!

This review is based on my impressions after a couple of days with the unit - I may update it later if anything relevant occurs long-term. Testing Methodology: I don't have a lot of sophistocated instruments for measuring the actual brightness, color gamut etc...  In general I stuck to sofware based tests and my somewhat subjective eyeballs. Construction: The top (back of the screen) is metal, as is keyboard and palm-rest area, the screen bezel and bottom are plastic.  This was a pretty good design decision as it keeps the bottom from turning into a hotplate in your lap.  The hinge feels solid and moves very smoothly. Screen: The screen is rated about 300 nits.  Just based on comparisions with others with similar ratings this screen seems like it might actually be a little brighter than it's rated.  It's perfectly visible outside in daylight as long as there isn't direct sunlight on the screen.  The 144hz refresh rate is a really nice feature and allows for some rock-solid motion.  The contrast and color gamut are very effective and pleasing to the eye.  I don't have a tool for measuring the colors so this could just be clever engineering, but nothing here feels like a compromise.  The screen does suffer from uneven backlight blooming so on a completely dark image, there are bright splotches around the margin, but this is pretty typical for an IPS LCD. GPU: The GPU seems to be able to take just about everything I've thrown at it on the most insane settings and I haven't noticed any performance problems.  The Witcher 3 and Darksiders Warmastered Edition look amazing in motion, with the latter running at a V-sync'd 144hz with no problems at all. It pulled a very respectable score of 14,000+ on the Final Fantasy XIV Stormbringer Benchmark with everything turned up to maximum and every optimization turned off. The laptop comes pre-configured with an overclock setting called \"Turbo\" mode which is activated by a button to the upper-left of the keyboard.  You can, of course, create your own overclocking profiles. In order to more efficiently use power, conserve battery, and cut down on fan noise, as with most contemporary gaming laptops, the Predator Helios 300 uses Intel Optimus.  In a nutshell, Intel Optimus switches dynammically between the considerably less powerful and less power-hungry integrated Intel GPU and the GTX-1660ti.  The system will attempt to guess which GPU should be used for a given process, but you can deliberately control this in a couple of different ways.  From the Nvidia Control Panel, you can set the GPU to use for a given application so that whenever that program (i.e. your games) are launched it automatically does so under the Nvidia card.  Alternatively you can tell the system to favor the Nvidia card for everything (not a great idea unless you want to listen to the fan all the time and watch your battery level drop before your  eyes).  And Lastly, there's a context menu item called \"run with graphics processor\" that lets you select which to use by right-clicking on an application before you launch it.  So Optimus is pretty useful for balancing performance, but it somes with a couple of unfortunate tradeoffs.  There is no \"Display\" option in the Nvidia control panel because Optimus dynamically manages those settings, and G-Sync and Fast Sync options are not possible though technically the GPU is capable of using them. Keyboard: The keyboard is, for the most part, great.  The keys are spaced reasonably, slightly convex, quiet and just have a nice feel.  I'm used to pressing harder so my fingers have a tendency to bounce and I wind up typing double letters occasionally, but it's nothing I can't adjust to. (I tried using the Windows \"Filter Keys\" setting to help with this but it's more of an accessiblity option and is too restrictive)  The width of the keyboard allows for the incorporation of a 10-key keypad on the right, however the keys are much narrower than the rest of the keyboard, and the 0 key has been shifted to the center column to accomodate the arrow keys, so it's a bit of compromise.  It's only really annoying when trying to type in a large string of numbers such as when entering a license key. Trackpad: The trackpad is generously large and very sensitive.  There are no mouse buttons, but the bottom of the pad is clickable with the right and left corners representing the right and left mouse buttons. Sound: The laptop comes with a pair of down-firing stereo speakers that are okay for what they are.  They're tinny and can't really get loud enough to overpower the fan noise when playing games.  Noise cancelling or noise isolating headphones are pretty much mandatory for gaming or anything that drives the GPU.  That said, the virtual surround effect is surprisingly convincing. Backlighting: They changed last-year's red backlight to blue, which I think is somewhat more pleasing to the eye, but it's kind of a deal breaker in the use-it-in-bed scenario because the blue light spectrum interferes with your ability to achieve REM sleep.  It's a thing, look it up. Battery: It runs on a 3720mAh battery which is about 25% more capacity than last year's model.  Trying to give a \"it lasts this many hours\" number is kind of pointless in my opinion because it's affected by background processes, screen brightness, what you're doing with it, the age of the battery, etc. Let's be honest though, no one is buying this laptop for its battery life.  Nvidia has several settings which seek to improve battery life while gaming, but they all involve framerate throttling.  If you want to game while not connected to mains power, then you're probably playing games that would work just fine on a laptop with a fraction of the power of this thing. Webcam/Mic The webcam maxes out at 720p30.  That resolution also holds for still images so it seems like that's the geometry of the sensor itself.  It works okay in relatively low light - with the brightness gain cranked all the way up, the glow of the screen is enough to allow it to capture a usable amount of detail in a dark room.  In a normally lit room the image is a bit darker than what you would see with your eyes, and as with most webcams, colors are little washed out.  And like most pinhole cameras, the brighter the lighting the clearer the picture and the more faithful the colors.  This would be perfectly serviceable in a well-lit office, or outdoors.  The stereo microphone picks up voices clean and clear. Network: The \"Killer\" WiFi chip in this machine is amazingly fast.  My Internet service tops off at around 25MB/s, and this Wi-Fi card easily hit 23MB/s (that's bytes, not bits) when downloading games from GOG Galaxy.  I was pleased to see that the laptop also maintains an RJ-45 for wired ethernet connnectivity - it uses a clever hinged port to maximize space while there's nothing plugged in. Hardware Accessibility/Upgrade difficulty: Unlike last year's model, there are no quick access ports - if you want to get at the Wi-Fi, M.2, Memory or SSD area, you have to remove the entire bottom of the shell.  Fortunately everything important is within reach after you take out the 10 philips screws and pull the bottom cover off. Cooling: This is by far the best vented laptop I've ever seen.  The heatsink fins and fans are clearly visible through the myriad slits on the bottom, sides and back.  The fans are as noisy as any laptop I've ever used, but not worse, though when you hit that Turbo button to kick in the overclocking profile and those fans crank up, it sounds like a jet preparing to take off, so if you're doing any moderate to heavy gaming, noise isolating or noise cancelling headphones are not optional. Storage: A 256GB PCIe M.2 drive is installed.  It tops off around 1.5Gbps which is a pretty respectable speed and pretty performmant.  It's not a lot of space though so it's fortunate that there's another M.2 slot to install another card later on.  There's also a bay for a 2.5\" drive, but the bracket and SATA connector kit comes with a warning that Acer no longer considers this a user serviceable operation and implies that your warranty may be voided by attempting to install it yourself. Instructions/Documentation: The documentation for the hardware was honestly a little disappointing.  It gives you a tour of the ports and the keyboard, but doesn't include anything about how to install M.2 devices, upgrade memory or install a 2.5\" drive - these aren't exactly rocket surgery, but it still feels like an oversite that Acer doesn't want to show you what goes where.  The SATA adapter for the 2.5\" drive requires connnection to a proprietary ribbon socket which they altogether fail to tell you how to locate on the motherboard. Other Stuff: I had to chuckle when I saw the \"Turbo\" button.  I'm old enough to remember when that was a thing on the Intel 386 CPUs, and unironically it does pretty much the same sort of thing here. The BIOS is about the most bare-bones affair I've seen recently, with no options for controlling and/or disabling the integrated GPU. The system came with Norton Ultimate installed.  Thankfully that's about the only piece of garbageware installed by Acer.  Microsoft's default \"Windows Defender\" is far superior to Norton and unlike Norton it won't waste a ton of CPU cycles for no good reason.  Windows Defender is already part of Windows 10 - just uninstall Norton and reboot to activate it.  It's better protection and doesn't expire and beg for more money in a year. I've attached an image of the installed applications to this review so you can see what it comes with. Summary: Pros: - Looks and feels sleek and solid - That 144hz screen is fantastic - 300 nits is not MacBook bright, but it's usable in daylight - Comes with fast PCIe M.2 Storage - Wi-Fi is incredibly fast - Powerful GPU - Very effective cooling - I never saw it break 46C Cons: - Blue backlighting is bad for bedtime use - Fans get loud when the system is under a load - No option to disable Optimus and enable GSync (so no GSync) - Norton Ultimate - seriously? Updates: (As I encounter new things that I think are relevant, I'll update the review here) - The USB-C socket is not wired to the video card so it's not possible to output video.  The laptop provides HDMI and a mini-DPort so it's not lacking in output options, but still."}, {"name": "tb", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2019", "title": "Can't beat the price to performance yet.", "review_text": "Laptop performs great.

Fan is loud but not piercing under load. Keyboard is soft but deliberate, great for typing. Very intrusive junkware had to be removed so notifications weren't popping up every 20 minutes, annoying but typical. Laptop is thinner then the more expensive ASUS & MSI competition. The half metal case is confidence inspiring. The bottom is very easy to remove with a few screws and gives you quick access to all replaceable parts  Normally I would not buy an Acer but their Predator line shows quality they have not shown in the past. I'm disappointed it's not RGB like it was advertised on Acers website (cross-referenced specific model #) but for the performance it's not too upsetting. Would recommend as long as the quality lasts as long as it looks good. Edit Make sure your dedicated GPU is enabled and set as default. Optimus is frustrating. But that is Nvidia and Intel's fault. Not Acer's Battery life comments. If you were expecting good battery life out of a laptop you should not be looking at Gaming laptops. There is alot of powerful hardware in this laptop and it gives up battery life for portability. Although I would have given up the 2.5 bay for a bigger battery. Give and take. If you think it's overheating while gaming the components will run fairly hot by default. Even up to 97c . You should really set a fan profile before assuming it's overheating. If it's really was overheating it would shut off automatically. Otherwise it idles at about ,45-55c in a 22c (72f) room. Also set your per game profile. It should not throttle under 80c +- you don't need to use turbo mode. The fan at 40-75 percent works fine in most cases. And is not too loud under 4400 rpm If you think the storage is too small. They placed this laptop in probably the biggest part of the market. You are getting a Hex core processor and a mid-high range GPU and a 144hrz pannel. Until recently you could not get a laptop with this type of hardware for under ,15-1600$. It has 2 m.2 slots and a 2.5 inch bay with provided install hardware.  They saved you money so you can get a plethora of storage options on your own. This is by far one of the simplest laptops to upgrade with 1 pannel. They also sell upgraded ones so you can skip the upgrade If you find that your unit is hitting 90c and above during game sessions and you feel comfortable using throttle stop. most of the temperature is because it turbos to 3.9ghz roughly. dropping the offset for each core will significantly drop your temps. You may lose 1 - 2 frames if you get too aggressive but you can dial it in to your liking. I can game a 70c with turbo at 3.1ghz There will be a small percentage of you with faulty units. Maybe consider an RMA before you trash talk the machine."}, {"name": "Troybuilt", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2019", "title": "This is a nice laptop, and gamer, (1 week review)", "review_text": "I almost cancelled my ordered when realizing the only reviews were all from Vine reviewers! I am glad I didn't. I have only owned 1 other laptop which lasted almost a decade. That and my PC's is what I have to compare it too. When I buy computer stuff I try to get the best for the money that will not be out of date for many years. In my mind I try to buy things that will be good for 8-10 years.   After looking at many laptops from top brands, and reading reviews and articles from the PC world, I realized I wanted a monitor at or above 120HZ. This one is 144HZ amazing! My old laptop became no fun when the cpu was way passed it's prime, so I wanted no less than a I7 8th gen, this one is the 9th gen! When it came to the video I wanted a 1060 or faster. This has the 1660ti, yesterdays beast card. The last on my concerns were heating up while under load. I am still concerned with heating up under load, but at this point it seems to handle everything I have put at it so far. The Predator Key pulls up the CPU, GPU,and Laptop temps, which has not gone much higher than mid 70's. The 2 games my kids and I have played on it might not be the most demanding either at this point.   I like the way the key board feels also, and I use a wireless mouse. I can not say enough about the monitor, it is just great! I have only had the laptop for a week at this point and will update my review if something great or terrible comes to light. Best of Luck! Troy *6 week update* I am very happy with this laptop. It is a daily used PC, and it is fantastic. I'm unable to find any negatives at this time, unless your looking at the 2060+ video cards that have come out this year. so far the 1660ti has been great. I will update again with anything new. At this time this was a great and enjoyable purchase."}, {"name": "Chris M.", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2019", "title": "CAUTION: Do Your Homework BEFORE Buying, especially \"high value\" items!", "review_text": "UPDATE: July 16, 2019.

So, next time, I'll purchase my \"high value items\" at a brick and mortar store where I know I can get an exchange if needed. On specs, this is an amazing laptop. Had it for 3 days, and it performed very well. However, and this is a BIG however, turns out that the Acer predator helios 300 series has a history of BSOD/black screens. Sure enough, the laptop froze up and despite spending nearly 2 hours with Acer tech support, there was nothing they could do. Oddly enough, after removing 1 RAM module, the laptop fired back up. But, I didn't buy a laptop with only half the RAM. Clearly, Acer needs to address this issue, as if you do your homework (I wish I had), you'll see lots of issues with black screens/unresponsive computers. Would I buy this again? No way. By comparison, I have an Asus that I've had ZERO issues with. In the future, I'm buying Asus, HP, Dell or anyone else but Acer."}, {"name": "daxsgarage", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2019", "title": "Best \"gaming laptop\" at this price point, full stop.", "review_text": "This is hands down the best laptop, or even desktop, I have ever owned. That's coming from long time AMD guy. It  pains me to say this, but AMD just doesn't exist in the mobile market at  this time. If you need real power in a laptop, Intel and Nvidia are the  only game in town now. I've started traveling more lately so I  needed a laptop that could essentially replace my desktop(s) and this Acer  has far surpassed my expectations in that regard. See attached image.  The construction is solid, and it looks great, in my opinion...sleek  enough to pass as professional with just a hint of \"gaming laptop\" appeal.  The fans can get loud when you're hammering on it, that's true. There is no  free lunch, a laptop must have compromises when they are stuffed with  this kind of hardware. That said, unless you run it in Turbo (read  overclocked) mode all the time I find the fan noise more than reasonable. I  have not found a game, or CPU workload, that required me to use Turbo in  order to have a good experience. It's just stupid fast. In my opinion, you  can't find a better laptop for the money, period.  As you can tell, I love it. Now, I'll answer some of the questions I had  before buying it since there seems to be some confusion. The following  information is from my own experience, if Acer changes things up in the future I can't help you. The is no RGB on this (the 1660ti) version. The keyboard is blue backlit only. For me, this is a pro as I\u2019m tired of red, and I think RGB is a silly overplayed gimmick. If you go to Acer directly, there are different versions with different features. The RAM (16gb total) is 2x8gb sticks of Kingston 2666mhz...it is in dual channel. It scores well in the benchmarks that I have ran and from my own experience 16gb is more than enough for 95% of people out there. It's enough for 100% of the gamers. The included 256gb M.2 style SSD is also from Kingston and seems to perform quite well. There is an additional empty M.2 slot in there. I didn't use it, so I have no idea what will or won\u2019t work in that slot. I decided to use the open 2.5 inch HDD/SSD space for my storage needs. (Please, for all that is sacred, don't you dare put a regular 2.5 HDD in there and hamstring this fine machine). I opted to stay with the Kingston memory theme and stuck a 1tb Kingston 2.5 SSD in there. So, as of this writing I have 186gb free on my C: Drive (it's got all the normal stuff loaded up), and I'm loading my giant Steam library and other big programs onto the 1tb D: Drive. This, in my opinion, is the way to go. The CPU is an Intel last gen refresh (you know 14+++++ lol). That said, it's a good one. 6 cores, 12 threads at 45 watts it tough to beat...actually, I don't think anyone is beating it right now. AMDs mobile Ryzens are topping out at 4 core, 8 threads as of the time of this writing.  I'm sure higher core count CPUs make their way into the laptop market in  the next few years, but for now...this is the best game in town. Also, it's  2019, you don't want a quad core, no matter who makes it. Trust me. The 1660ti is a beastly little thing. Nvidia's naming scheme is clearly insane, but this guy is sweet. It's based on the new Turing architecture and performs quite well. It will smoke a GTX1060 and spit at the heels of a decent desktop Vega 56...and all the while using way less power. For desktops it's a hard card to love, but in a laptop it's brilliant.  The battery is fine for what it is. People wanting 10-hour battery life  and 144 frames per second in their games, pull yourself together people.  Sacrifices must be made for mobility. When on battery the laptop  automatically switches over to the Intel IGP and doing regular (non-taxing)  stuff will get you 4-5 hours. You can force the 1660ti to play ball  while running on the battery through the Nvidia control panel...but I hope  you don't plan on a long gaming session...maybe 1.5 hours. Pro tip: You  want to game? Find a wall outlet.  The \"Killer\" WIFI and internet stuff...actually works. I was getting  stupid fast wireless downloads at distances away from my router that  shocked me. I'm not even going to run an ethernet cable unless I'm playing  a FPS. Blazing fast connection and rock solid so far.  Sadly, you will have to remove Norton (duh) and Windows 10 comes with the  usual fluff that nobody wants...it is what it is. Took me about 30  minutes to remove all the silly stuff and download all the stuff I actually  needed. Keep the Predator App, I think they will be  useful (Update: It is, see below update). When I was setting up this machine, I did log it into my Microsoft  account, and it appears I have Office installed. Not sure if that's because  I have Office on another machine registered to my account...or if this  comes with Office. Your mileage may vary.  The \"Turbo\" button...here's the deal. It only works when plugged in and  above 40% battery. It basically raises the voltage limits of the machine,  while turning on the fans full blast. This results in the CPU auto boosting  on more cores and higher than usual. Oh, and it also overclocks the 1660ti!  Yes, yes you read that right...basically it's an \"overclock button\".  Normally I would laugh at such silliness, but I have to say...it works. It  sounds like a small jet, but it goes like one too. I use it for  benchmarking and playing around...but you could game with it in Turbo,  provided you have headphones. All that said, I'm getting like 62 fps in  AC Odysseus on Very High WITHOUT \"Turbo\". If you're familiar  with this painfully un-optimized AAA title you will understand how  impressive that is, lol. Love that game though...don't judge me.  Hope this helps someone make a big decision. Edit: Update 7/18/19 I read a review where someone was having issues with an echo on the audio. I didn't have this problem as I have an external sound processor that I use. At any rate, I plugged in my headphones directly (1/8th jack) and sure enough...there was an echo. After a bit of investigation, it's from the \"Waves MaxxAudio\" App. This app can be tuned/disabled through the Predator App under the App center portion. Turn that guy off, and your echo goes away. That particular App might be useful in a gaming situation, but if your just watching videos or listening to music it falls a little short. I never thought I would say this, but let Windows control your sound and you will be fine, lol. Edit 9-25-19. Man I love this thing. I travel (airplanes) with it weekly and thus far it has been flawless. Every evening when I get done with work I'm reminded how nice the keyboard on this thing is compared to my company issue Lenovo work laptop. No regrets, I'd still buy it at the current price...very few laptops can compete at this price range. Edit 11-26-19. Still the best at this price point. 1660ti is just the best for laptops balancing performance and battery."}, {"name": "NJBoden", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2019", "title": "An improvement over the last Helios 300 in every way.", "review_text": "After owning the last Helios 300 (GTX 1060) and selling it last year I was ready to be done with the Predator laptops.  The old red laptop was just too big and bulky, and between the thermal issues and instability with the OS I was just done with it altogether.  Then they released this Helios and I'm truly blown away. LOOKS- For starters it is a thinner, sleeker, lighter, and much more visually appealing laptop compared to the big red \"gamer\" aesthetic they were going for with the old model.  While performance matters more than looks to me and while it was a tremendous value for the price, it certainly drew a lot of attention for all the wrong reasons.  This one is a thinner, more modern looking computer with cleaner lines and a smaller profile while still keeping the same screen size.  The blue theme to this is more appealing VS the red and I use it for gaming as well as at work.  My colleagues presume it is a professional laptop but little do they know it is also a gaming powerhouse. PERFORMANCE- The 1660ti is only 7% weaker than my GTX 1070 that is in my PC tower.  It will play pretty much anything at 1080p ultra settings with fantastic frame rates.  Combined with the 144hz screen it is only trumped by my 4K monitor on my actual battlestation at home.  You can look up benchmarks if you're interested, but bottom line here is you'll have no problem with 1080p gaming.  If you want to do 4k you can output to an external monitor.  But that isn't the point of using a laptop. KEYBOARD- It's also an improvement over the previous Helios 300.  It's no mechanical keyboard but it is definitely responsive and comfortable to type on.  The inclusion of a numpad is also a plus SCREEN- Crystal clear with a high refresh rate.  By far the best I've seen on any laptop.  Mine didn't have any screen bleed but I can't speak for everyone.  Good size and the colors are nice and clear. BATTERY- It's simply OK.  You're gonna have better GPU performance with this plugged in but I can see general tasks being done on this for maybe a few hours before it needs to be plugged in. STORAGE- The 256GB drive is an M.2 drive and is crazy fast, but it doesn't hold a lot.  You can add another M.2 drive and there is a bay to add another Hard drive or SSD.  You'll have to actually wire the drive into your motherboard (the old Helios had the port pre-installed) and this is a service that could actually void your warranty.  It isn't the hardest thing to do, but I would definitely recommend taking it to an Acer care center if you can't figure it out. FINAL THOUGHTS- The new Predator Helios 300 is worth every penny.  With improved stability, thermals, looks and performance it is a no brainer.  This thing is gonna be the replacement for my PC tower if and or when it finally kicks the bucket.  If you held off on buying the last Predator due to all the issues you heard about I would say you made the right call.  This is the solution to those problems you were waiting for and then some.   If you're on the fence I can wholeheartedly say (with my name on the line) that this laptop is absolutely worth it.  Yeah it's expensive and I wasn't too thrilled about shelling out for another Predator after all the problems with the first one, but I am glad I got this and I know you'll be too."}, {"name": "Abysal", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2019", "title": "Great gaming laptop, excellent value for the money!", "review_text": "The Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52 laptop with the Intel i7-9750h & nVidia 1660 Ti is a great performer. I've been using it as my daily work laptop with some occasional gaming for about a month. It replaced my Dell e6430. - It runs the latest games at above 60 fps with settings on high (generally speaking), usually much higher. PUBG runs at 95 - 105fps (non turbo), to 110 - 125fps (turbo) - 1080p, high settings. - The screen is excellent, 144hz IPS, and also works really well for Lightroom photo work. There is slight flex on open and close, I wish it was more ridged. It uses a metal lid and features the predator logo that is lit light blue at all times and cannot be turned off. - The keyboard feels decent for a chiclet keyboard, the keys have a positive activation feeling, are quiet, but feel slightly soft on bottom out. The back light can be turned off, but the 30 sec auto off setting cannot be adjusted. This version does not have and RGB back lighting, it's a light blue back light only. The keyboard deck, palm rest, and sides of the laptop are all one metal piece, there is no flex on the keyboard, which is excellent. - The touch pad feels really smooth, but the right/left click button areas require more pressure to activate. - Wireless card is a Killer Wireless 802.11ac i1550 (Intel 9560NGW) - Links at 866Mbps - I've not had any drop-outs or disconnects. Mainly used with Cisco APs and Asus RT3200-AC at home. - Ethernet jack is very difficult to disengage the CAT5 cable from, it seems to snag on the RJ45 connector. Luckily I don't need to use wired ethernet too often. - The web cam and mic combo are pretty standard and of average picture and sound quality. They work fine for the occasional Skype call. - The the model I got came with a 256GB M.2. 2880 SATA SSD B+M key (Kingston RBUSNS8154P3256GJ1) - Also came with 16GB RAM - 2 x 8GB Kingston ACR26D4S9S8ME-8 PC-21300 DDR4 / DDR4-2666 (1333Mhz) - 19-19-19-43 timings. - It's very easy to remove the bottom panel to gain access to an additional M.2 slot and SATA 2.5\" storage bay, both RAM slots, and WiFi mini PCIe card. - The built in speakers produce pretty nice sound, they don't get as loud as I'd like them to be, but are perfectly adequate. - The fans are generally quite, when the system is used for web or light work, the CPU fan is slightly audible. During gaming they ramp up and get louder, and with turbo enabled, they get really loud, like a mini jet, and would be a definite annoyance for those around you. Head phones are recommend. I use turbo mode in PUBG, and it boosts frames anywhere from 10 to 15 extra fps. - The WASD area and palm rest don't get hot during gaming, just a little warm. The area above the keyboard and the num pad areas are where it gets hot. - On battery, I run the laptop in battery saver mode, and get about 4 hours, that's enough for a movie during a flight or several meetings of note taking / email / web. - While gaming I've noticed the battery will tick down while still on AC. I don't know yet if this is an issue. Searching around the web I've found reports that MSI and ASUS laptops do this too and it is by design; supposedly. During the course of a 3 hour gaming session in PUBG and turbo on, my battery drained to 75%. The drain is slower without turbo. I assume after the battery gets low enough, the CPU and GPU will throttle. I plan to reach out to ACER support for the official explanation. - I've picked up a spare AC adapter - included in photo, search Amazon for: 19.5V 9.23A AC Adapter Charger Power Supply for Acer Predator Helios 300 G3-571-77QK, G3-571 G3-572 PH317-51, Acer Aspire V17 Nitro VN7-793G, V15 Nitro VN7-593G Tip 5.5mm, Not Big Tip 7.4mm with Pin - It also fits nicely into Swiss Backpack - J14B-1H-A - 18.5 *12.5*7 (inches) So far I'm very happy with the laptop, it has excellent performance, very nice expandability, is comfortable to use and looks really good."}, {"name": "Evaldas", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2019", "title": "Better then expected", "review_text": "So I'll start with the fact that this laptop came with undervolted cpu which I found kinda strange.

Then if you dare even think about hitting the turbo button the fans go right to 100% and if you don't have noise canceling headphones/headset then you find yourself not being able to hear the game unless you turn it up high enough to drown out the fans. Terrible thermal design as it gives up surface area and has to compensate with stupidly loud fans, it really should be a 17 inch with another heat pipe for both the cpu and gpu or at the very least more dense (or just larger) heat sinks. I've found the keyboard will double some letters, I don't know if that is a fault of the switches they use or what but It never happened on my old Asus rog laptop so that adds a bit to the lack of thought that went into this laptoop.

The right side has a USB Type-C port, a USB port that allows power-off charging, an external display port and a HDMI port. Speakers are angled to the rear on either side of the laptop base for stereo sound, which is crisp and clear. Both left and right sides as well as the back edge have multiple ventilation vents for the cooling fan. The underside also has an expansive ventilation area. The fan, though not loud, appears to be powerful as I did not experience any notable heating of the laptop components. The keyboard is brightly backlit with a bluish white light. At the top on the left side is the Turbo button, which allows you to switch the overclocking and fan level. There is also a \u201cPredatorSense\u201d key which launches the PredatorSense software by which you can monitor and change those settings as well as customizing your gaming profile. The camera window above the screen has a reasonably clear picture, and there are two internal stereo microphones on either side.

Acer has really delivered with this laptop for 2019. Just a quick story, I\u2019m upgrading from a 17\u2019 2014 Asus G751JT that has a GTX970m 3GB, Intel i7 4c/8t 4710hq 2.5ghz/3.5ghz boost, 60hz IPS screen that was $1500 and is 8.6lbs. As a college student, my tolerance for lugging that thing has been getting lower over the years. Also had some infamous battery problems that were annoying. I needed a good overall laptop to fulfill my gaming and study needs as I commute an hour to my university and stay there most of the day.  It\u2019s amazing on how far gaming laptops have gone within the last 5 years. Luckily, I was able to buy this laptop on prime day for $1000 which sold out hours after it got discounted. That speaks volume of how fantastic this laptop is. This won\u2019t be a full-fledged nitty gritty review, so I\u2019ll just stick to my opinions and findings on the product. The laptop feels premium. I\u2019m amazed with the build quality at this price point along with the weight. It\u2019s an eye catcher as I enjoyed looking at this laptop when I first unboxed it. The keyboard is pretty solid as it didn\u2019t take long for me to get used to typing it. To be fair, I have smaller than average hands so your mileage will vary on this. It\u2019s comfortable to type on for me, and I enjoy the sky-blue backlight as I\u2019ve been stuck on red for 5 years. No complaints on the trackpad. It\u2019s a little rough, I wish there were actual physical buttons for right and left click but I mostly stick to my USB mouse. The screen is 144hz and it is BRIGHT. The colors look great and the buttery smooth screen is just an awesome upgrade for me. There is some backlight bleed, but I only notice it on startup and loading screens. I do not notice it during gameplay unless you are playing a game with dark settings. The screen is so good for the price that I am willing to forgive some minor backlight bleed. If this was a $1600+ laptop, then I\u2019d have a serious problem with it. Internet speed is good, no complaints. This laptop comes standard with 2x8gb of ram. Although I might upgrade to 2x16gb of ram down the road if I need to for my Information Technology classes. One thing to note is you definitely need to upgrade the storage in the laptop. You have space for a 2.5 drive and another NVMe ssd.  I\u2019m definitely going to get a 2tb sshd when I have the spare funds; which thankfully Acer provided a kit for a 2.5 drive for your convenience. A 1tb WD Blue is a good m.2 drive to get for storage if you need some fast speeds for any applications that benefit from it like Photoshop or VMware. Now for gaming, I\u2019ll throw in a couple games. The Witcher 3 runs between 70-80fps on ultra-settings. Deus Ex: Mankind Divided was anywhere between 55-70fps on ultra. And for fun, I threw in Rocket League and it maxed out with spare performance to boot. Threw in a heavily modded Fallout New Vegas with 30+ mods and it ran beautifully. Battlefield 4 was a pretty awesome experience too.  Overall, this laptop will handle most, if not, all your gaming needs. What\u2019s great is that I never reached above 75c on the GPU and 80c on the cpu without touching anything on the laptop (Auto fans, no overclocking). The fans are somewhat audible; they never got as loud as turning on the turbo button which is just overkill imo. I usually keep fan speeds at around 85%. Keep in mind, my room temperature was 76F. I definitely don\u2019t recommend any heavy gaming in a quiet place like the library, but if you are then you\u2019re not doing your studying like you should be. Look up a YouTuber named OwnOrDisown. He reviewed the laptop and configured the laptop settings to get a nice middle ground for extra performance. Battery life is anywhere from 3.5 \u2013 5 hours depending on your usage. This is with 20% brightness, max keyboard backlight brightness, and some YouTube in the background while typing up this review on Microsoft word. It\u2019s not a long battery life like some ultra-books, but the battery is enough for me to get through some classes before I have to charge which is fine. I don\u2019t recommend gaming on battery unless it\u2019s a low intensity game like Rimworld, Stardew Valley, or AoEII. Seriously, don\u2019t expect any gaming laptop to run AAA titles at max settings and max performance on battery. It\u2019s unreasonable. One minor annoyance I had was the sound. Apparently, the laptop comes with Acer TrueHarmony that modifies sound by default. If you are hearing an echo-like sound as I was, then I\u2019ll save you the 30 minutes. Open the PredatorSense interface and click on the App Center tab. Open Waves MaxxAudio. Click on the Waves Nx tab and disable the feature. Viola, the echo is gone. You can go back to the MaxxAudio tab and configure the sound properly to your liking. Closing Thoughts: This laptop is a breath of fresh air for me. I was extremely lucky on getting it for $1000. It does so many things right that I\u2019d say it\u2019d warrant the full price (Which is currently $1200 as of the time of writing..or typing? Whatever.) and I\u2019d be ok with it. If you\u2019re considering on getting a laptop, this is one of the few I\u2019d heavily recommend because of the price point.

The bad. - Fans are really loud. When I say loud, I mean Airplane loud. When you hit \"turbo mode,\" get ready for lift-off. - Keyboard layout is not very good. Look it up and judge it for yourself.

The UGLY. -  The IPS panel on this machine (which is known for having backlight bleed, or simply put, light spots around the corners) is very fragile. After looking it up, it seems like many many people complain about this problem. To make matters worse, the laptop lid is BENDY, which causes the display to perform even worse. It is made of plastic that feels very cheap. In contrast, the frame around the keyboard is metallic and solid. So, whenever you are watching a movie taking place in a dark setting or nighttime you CAN'T  AVOID seeing white areas. Very annoying. If this is important to you, don't buy it.

One thing I did have to do was to go into the nvidia control panel to set the Global Settings to use the nvidia 1660 graphics card. It defaults to the integrated graphics which is not as good as the nvidia card and why you are getting this laptop. I can only compare it to my only other Windows desktop which has the GTX1060 3G card from last year and this laptop is so much faster it is unreal. In one of my games I was getting over 100 FPS during FPP gameplay. Even over WiFi the laptop is responsive. The built in trackpad is okay.  You'll definitely want an external mouse. The included software like Predator Sense is particularly interesting as it provides the ability to overclock the GPU and easily. So far I haven't needed to but as far as having the software already preloaded is neat. Fan noise even without overclocking is noticeable but expected considering how much work this laptop is doing during game play. Audio through my bluetooth headset is really good. The Waves NX technology with my old bluetooth headset does make gameplay a lot better making it easier to hear which direction opponents are coming from. I'm seriously considering getting a NX enable headset to see how much better it could be. WiFi is solid and I'm connected to 5G for gameplay. I've also ordered a PCIe NVMe M.2 module to expand the drive space. The stock NVMe had about 190G available on it so still plenty of space but it is nice being able to expand with the extra empty M.2 slot."}, {"name": "Sam Goodman", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2019", "title": "Amazing value on all fronts", "review_text": "Simply put, this thing is great especially at the $928 black Friday 2019 price I paid. Good mix of portability, versatility, gaming, without going too far in either direction (being so thin and light that it can't game, being so powerful that it can't be portable). This is a great middle ground, and an amazing price. I'll now break my review down into different sections. Screen: 144Hz is becoming the norm for gaming laptops, including budget ones. For me, the response time is what makes this screen feel great. The 3ms response time is published prominently on the listing because most gaming laptops have response times at least twice that, and I can tell the difference going from my 144hz 9ms 17\" laptop I previously used. Same refresh rate, different response \"feel\". It's noticeable faster on the Helios. It isn't color-calibrated or anything, and according to experts the colors are just mediocre. To my simple gamer eyes, colors pop and games look great. So it does what it needs to! Gaming: The i7-9750H is the standard for this generation of gaming laptops, and it's just a refresh of the 8750H. 100Mhz faster, it's basically the same. Not too much to discuss about it other than the thermals which I'll discuss more later. The GPU is the new GTX 1660TI. This is why the Helios is relatively \"cheap\" compared to some laptops touting an RTX 2080. Honestly, I've used very powerful gaming laptops, and they do not feel faster. Unless you're going home and hooking the laptop up to a 4k monitor, which you should have a powerful gaming desktop for anyway, you don't need more performance than this. Even with a RTX 2060, the GPU doesn't reach full utilization because the mobile version of Intel's CPUs cannot keep up with the GPU performance. With a 1660ti, you get high settings in games, with over 70-80fps (AAA games), and it's being fully used, so you know that your investment is being put to good use. Keyboard: Acer did an amazing job of mixing a great feel for both typing and gaming. I have not owned the machine for long, but have reached my full typing speed very quickly. Just mushy enough to be comfortable in gaming, but tactile enough for typing to be a breeze and enjoyable. Mousepad: Great for a gaming laptop. The use of Microsoft precision drivers makes it very accurate, and I have been happy with the feel. Click-and-drag functions are easy to do, not something I can say for all laptops. Aesthetics and build quality: The aesthetic is now a blue, not the familiar red that the Helios line has used before. Some non-Amazon models have RGB keyboards, this one does not. I personally don't care, but it's there. In a way I do wish the logo on the back was smaller or less angular, but having my peers know that it's a gaming laptop doesn't really make a difference for me as a student. The build quality is great, and it feels like a quality machine. Yes, the bottom is plastic, but that's true for laptops costing over $2,000 as well. The parts that you touch such as the lid, and keyboard deck are metal, and have no flex in them. It feels like a machine costing hundreds more, evidenced by the fact that Acer uses the same chassis/frame for models costing closer to $2,000. That speaks for itself. Portability: The laptop is relatively thin without compromising on the cooling performance. It is 5 lbs, and this again is good enough without giving up potential performance. The fact that it's 15\" and not 17\" also adds to the portability, if you're thinking about a 17\" and have to move your laptop often, don't do it. The power supply \"brick\" in the cord is also relatively small for the performance you're bringing around. I can carry the laptop with one hand easily, and in a backpack it feels like it isn't there. Battery life is shorter than an ultrabook, sure, but that's what you should expect. 3-4 hours is enough if you're a student in my opinion, and I rarely need to use my laptop when I'm not near a power plug. Thermals/noise: Acer has done some serious engineering here. I have used ASUS, MSI, and even custom-made liquid metal applied laptops. I know what I'm talking about here. Any ASUS I've tried hits 95+ celsius on the CPU right away even in normal gaming, even with the fans all the way up. Seriously, they're horrible. MSI's that I have experience with are actually quite good at cooling, but they were also thicker than this machine. I most recently used a custom-made Eluktronics laptop with optional liquid metal applied for cooling (goes between the CPU and heatsink for maximum heat transfer). This laptop is actually most comparable to that one, and even is slightly better in some ways. Acer has seriously taken into account the thermal paste they use, the construction of the fanblades, and the necessary fan speeds, PLUS, the machine is undervolted from the factory. From stock settings, the CPU stays in the 80s, usually below 85. Given how Intel has not been able to get past their 14nm process, this is sadly a great result. If you use predator sense software and change the GPU overclock to fast or extreme, you get more performance, and louder fans, resulting in slightly lower temps, plus better framerates, going from 70-76 in my borderlands 3 benchmarking. I personally am a tinkerer, and enjoy messing with settings. I used throttlestop and undervolted the CPU more to -.150V, plus adding 15W to the chip's turbo boost power consumption, changing it from 45W to 60W, and changing the turbo boost time window from  28 seconds up to 40. Even with adding a lot of power to the chip, my CPU stays 77-80 now, with a maximum of 81 in games. This is even with the Acer software set to extreme overclocking, and with the fans in their stock overclocked setting. All summed up, as someone who knows a lot about laptops, desktops, and their cooling issues, this is hands-down an amazing feat. Acer is the only manufacturer in the game right now that cares at all about thermals it appears. The changes they've done with the thermal paste, fanblade design, and undervolting is a GREAT innovation. Altogether, this is an amazing laptop. I'd recommend it to anyone looking in the price range, and even those looking closer to the $2,000 price mark, as the 1660ti GPU is really all you need for a gaming laptop, they almost always have 1080p screens anyway. I'm happy I got it on black friday, but it's well worth the $1200 regular price as well. A last note is storage. The laptop only ccomes with 256gb SSD storage. The included SSD is actually NVMe, and extremely fast. Just plan on getting an additional 1tb slower ssd, or even a hdd if you're desperate. Acer has two extra mounting options included, with hardware provided. You can add a 2280 M.2 SSD, or a 2.5\" SSD. You can total have 3 drives in the machine, and that's amazing for a 15\" option. Upgrading is very simple, just need a philips screwdriver, and there's many videos online of how to open this laptop."}, {"name": "Nathan", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2019", "title": "Brand new computer would not turn on", "review_text": "Product did not work out of the box.

The keyboard is very sturdy and backlit, it has three levels of brightness and has no flex at all, it feels nice and has a good travel.

The Decepticon logo and PREDATOR logo across the back aren't exactly appealing. The rest of the laptop is a nice understated black, however, which I appreciate. Keyboard/Touchpad: Nothing special here. The keyboard is serviceable, but not spectacular, the touchpad is a touchpad. Nothing fancy. Performance: Here's where we get to the good stuff. Any other laptop with these same specs is either more expensive, or throttles because it can't cool adequately. The Helios 300, however, has a newly redesigned cooling system that handles gaming without overheating or throttling (tested on Aida64 and Heaven benchmarks). You also get a Full HD 144hz screen. No GSync, but you can't have everything, I suppose. Overall, the price to performance ratio on this laptop is pretty much unbeatable.  Anything else with the same specs either overheats and throttles (Dell, HP, Asus) or is more expensive (Razer, MSI, Lenovo). Acer manages to hit that perfect sweet spot.

So I got this laptop on the gamer's day deal for 1000$ and that is a great value for me since I was looking for this laptop since 2018, my previous laptop was MSI GL62M, and I sell it when I got my new Acer Predator Helios 300, it have more RAM, stronger CPU, GPU and much powerful gaming screen with 144Hz. I have few notes over all my use in the last 3 weeks since I got it, the laptop makes an echo when I take the charger out while I wear my headphones and that's a little bit annoying and when you pull the charger out it makes a sound and I don't like it as well, the screen is perfect, but before I purchase this laptop people kept saying that there is a screen bleed on the top of the screen, and that is not a screen bleed at all, it from the manufacturer, since it is pressing so hard on the top side of the screen and that what make the white color showing, but in my case this not annoying at all, and I don't notice it at all and I am really happy with it. another thing that the charger place is different than any other laptop I use in my life which is on the middle left side of the laptop and that's a kinda annoying me as well, also one time I was playing games and the predator sense was working on background and I wanted to use the max fans speed ( which are really loud when they are on ) it didn't work and I had to close it and launch it again and it worked. Turbo button works well and the installation of the HDD was very easy and works perfect ( I bought a Seagate firecuda 2TB from amazon on a deal for 65$ only and this SSHD works really well - also I install it with Justech screwdriver which is also from amazon ). I recommend who buy this laptop to get a cooling pad with it because it get really hot when playing high FPS games like PUBG, Fortnite, overwatch and other games, because it will help lowing down the temperature so much. Final review: The material that used to build this laptop is really good, blue color that added to this years model is just insane and beautiful, you can open the laptop with one finger easily, but what annoys me that fingerprints are staying and you have to clean them daily if you want to keep you laptop clean. Screen is good for me even with the white pressure on the middle top screen on and sometimes I don't even notice it. GPU and CPU are just amazing for this price point and they work perfectly with no problems at all, just watch out for the temperature. keyboard is well built and I have no problems typing on it and im writing this review while using the laptop keyboard, also the blue back-lit looks amazing at night when the lights around you are off, I really like it. track-pad is really annoying as well, you feel like your fingers are sticking when ever you move around, I recommend every one to get a mouse to avoid using it, this the most part that I didn't like about this laptop. sound feels amazing on this laptop, and I can hear my favorite music on it and listen to video's without any problem at all, It feels nice to listen to favorite stuff on this laptop Audio with this phenomenal quality. Battery gives me around 4 hours while I don't play, just watching movies and browsing and it last for long time, but when I am playing games it gives me around 1:00 to 1:30 hours at max while gaming. webcam is coming at 720p30 which is not that much and If you a kind of person that use laptop for streaming and video calling and you want who watch you in a better picture you may want to get a better external webcam. The advertising of this laptop for the Killer Doubleshot Pro Wi-Fi card is not for nothing I really feel it is download stuff more faster than my previous laptop and I really like it. well done Acer. Storage comes with a kingstone 256GB PCIe M.2 drive is installed, It works perfectly and fast on day to day tasks and I really appreciate Acer for this SSD that they installed.

I love how compact it is because it makes it easy to take to class with me for notes during lectures. However, this laptop has been an absolute nightmare. I bought this mostly because I needed a laptop for college, and the fact that it was a \"gaming\" laptop is just a plus because hey, who doesn't want that? Being busy with college, I have not used it to game. I played Minecraft and Stardew Valley on it for only a few hours and THAT'S IT since I bought it. For whatever reason, this laptop has been crashing and giving me the blue screen of death constantly, and it has erased hours and hours of work I put in on my assignments, and it has kicked me out of online tests!!!! This laptop was supposed to help with school, not destroy my grades!!!! The battery life was awful until I jumped on their website to wait 2 hours for a solution of updating my driver from their customer support rep. It lasted maybe 2 hours max? It will also randomly start buzzing loudly as if I am running an intensive game, but all I am doing is using the Edge internet browser and Microsoft words, two apps that are meant to be used with Windows! I spent weeks with this issue and time after time, their customer support has disappointed me with solutions that do not fix the problem. They say they are sorry for the inconvenience but that's a load of s***. It's past my return window now because I have been stuck in a cycle of trying to reach them, waiting for them to reply, then getting email messages days later, all on top of trying to stay on top of school work. They won't give me my money back so that I can buy an actual reliable laptop that runs normally without promising to be a better performancing \"gaming laptop,\" and instead keep trying to get me to return it to be repaired! That'd be an option if they had told me sooner, but I definitely don't trust them to do it in a timely matter now. I have wasted far too much time and effort and sacrificed MY GRADES to deal with this. In a nutshell, this laptop is unreliable and will crash on you for just using Microsoft Edge (internet) and Microsoft Word. This is without using it for its intended purpose: GAMING. Their customer support stinks and will drag out the issue for weeks, no matter how many times you express your frustration on how it is impeding your progress in school!"}, {"name": "Jmon", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2019", "title": "Bad temperatures, back light bleeding, high CPU usage while idle", "review_text": "My expectations were completely wrong.

I will certainly return this laptop and hopefully exchange it for another one to determine if the one I have received is a bad lemon. Other than that, I do not recommend this laptop. UPDATE 12/05/19 I found out the reason why the UserBenchMarks were off. The GPU needed to be switched to global in the Nvidia control panel. Good marks so far for now. My CPU temps are better now that I've updated the BIOS as well as optimize my undervoltage by going down further. Now I get the expected average idle temperatures of 50-55 Celsius.

Comparable to 1300-1700 gaming laptops. And after opening it up and playing games like RDR2, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Rainbow Six Siege, And even Apex Legends (all on high/ultra settings) - it\u2019s a beautiful and Smooth experience. Very happy. But there\u2019s one downside Of which I make A recommendation to adjust: the 256gb (Hard drive ) storage) just is to small. That\u2019s the big downside with this laptop, that\u2019s not enough room for much games (EX: RDR2 took up >140gb space  alone). Thus what I did immediately after buying was purchase a 1TB SSD 2.5 (Samsung Evo - roughly $150 I paid), And installed it (pretty easy after watching instructions on YouTube for this helio 300 model - but DO NOT attempt to do so unless you\u2019re prepared to void warranty - i.e. unscrewing the laptop bottom I believe voids warranty, that\u2019s What I  read, but not fully sure, so beware). Adding the 1TB SSD gives me significant storage space for my games + much faster Laptop performance (faster bootup, faster game load times, etc). Thus in my opinion, the 2019 Helios 300 + adding 1TB SSD is an amazing purchase and I\u2019m very much enjoying it. Will update of anything changes."}, {"name": "mew380", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2019", "title": "Great gaming laptop overall for the money", "review_text": "I have had this laptop for almost 3 weeks and have been putting it through its paces with general use, games, watching streaming videos, etc. before writing this review. ======= Pros: ======= * Cooling is MUCH improved over the 2018 PH315-51 model and comes factory under-volt by -0.125v which certainly helps. * The screen bezel is a lot thinner than the older models. The screen just feels bigger now even though logically, on paper, a 15.6\" screen is a 15.6\" screen. * Has a DisplayPort * All USB ports are USB 3.0 (Instead of 2x 2.0 and 1x 3.0 as on the older model) * Gaming performance is great * Overall performance is great * Boot time is insanely fast on the NVME drive. Around 10 seconds or so, if that. * Screen is beautiful, colors are vibrant, the view angle is fantastic, and the 144 HZ refresh rate is great; although please see my gripe about discoloration of the top of the screen in the Cons section. * The touch pad is nice and spacious * It is pretty light as far as gaming laptops go. I've seen some people complain that this laptop is heavy; but coming from an older gaming laptop that weighed almost 15 pounds... The weight of this laptop is a major relief! * The keys are back-lit which is great for low-light/night time computing/gaming * The chassis is nice. The top (back of the screen) and the keyboard area is metal, while the bottom and the bezel surrounding the screen is durable plastic. I absolutely love how nice and cool the metal is against my wrists when I'm typing. ======= Cons: ======= * My biggest gripe about this laptop is that there is visible light/color distortion at the top of the screen that is very noticeable against dark backgrounds. This is very distracting if you're watching a movie and there's dark scenes, or if you like to play horror games where typically the environment is dark. I've noticed a lot of people calling this light bleed and I've seen multiple screenshots of the effect; but this isn't light bleed (Well, it might be in the technical sense of the word). You know how if you press your finger lightly against an LCD screen (I'm NOT recommending that you do this by the way), it discolors slightly around the area where you touched? That is what's happening here. Apparently the bezel at the top of the screen is pressing WAY too freaking tight against the top of the screen (From factory!) and causing the discoloration at the top of the screen. I can't imagine that this is good for the health of the screen. This NEEDS to be fixed. * NVME drive is small at 256 GB. There is 237 GB usable, but realistically, there is less than that due to operating system install, so there is more around 130 - 150 GB of free space for applications, games, etc. You can load a handful of modest sized games or one huge game (Doom 2016 is around 80 - 100 gigs after patches and Final Fantasy XV is around 90 gigs after patches. Sheesh, game sizes are getting absolutely ridiculous!). That little drive will be hurting for free space in no time at all after a few games are installed. You will definitely want to add a spare drive to put games on. Acer claims that the laptop is expandable with a second NVME drive and a 2.5 inch bay (Which does include the connector you need for it in the package), but the entire back has to come off if you want to put a drive in internally, and you might void the warranty in the process if you do it yourself; so it's not a false claim, but it's a 'gotcha' claim. An external USB drive is the way to go if you want to remain on the safe side and don't want to pay a tech to put a drive in for you. * Battery life is OK; not great, but not bad either. When not gaming it can get about 3 - 4 hours of light use. It is absolutely horrendous when gaming at approximately 50 minutes, give or take a few depending on the game. Although I will say that this is to be expected from a gaming laptop. It's a lot of power packed into a tiny device. You will definitely want to be plugged in if you want to game on it for any extended length of time. * The webcam is horrible. It is -technically- HD in resolution, but only in resolution. The picture quality resembles early 2000s webcams. The video quality is something between a VHS recording and low quality grainy DVD. You'll either want to get an external webcam or pass this laptop up for a different one because this webcam sorely disappoints. It will work in a pinch though. I will note that it helps a bit to have a very well lit room if you want to use the webcam; even so, it's still pretty bad in my opinion. In the end it doesn't matter to me personally since I don't use webcam that often anyway. * The sound quality of the microphone is not fantastic. It sounds like someone is talking through a tin can. Like the webcam though, It will work in a pinch. I don't use microphones that much anyway, so it isn't a big deal for me. * The speakers sound piercing and tinny. No bass whatsoever. This is to be expected though, most laptops don't have the greatest speakers anyway. Use headphones or an external speaker system whether wired or blue tooth. * Acer seems bent on making installing your own OS on this laptop as hard as possible; even if you want to install a different edition of Windows 10 (For example: It comes with Windows 10 Home but you want to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro). It is doable but be prepared to do a little digging and research to figure out how to do it. I would expect this kind of crap on a low end cheap laptop, but NOT on an expensive gaming laptop! * UEFI/BIOS settings are bare minimal. You can tweak a few boot settings and that is about it. It is definitely NOT a power user's utility. Again, I expect this on a low end laptop, not a gaming laptop. ============================================= Mixed Feelings that are neither Pro nor Con for me: ============================================= * Although cooling is much improved over last year's model, for some games, you will want to turn the fan to max. Keep an eye on PredatorSense temps. I personally prefer to max the fans if I notice the temps getting higher than about 75, but that's just me. * There is a very limited amount of USB ports if you're not counting the USB-C connector, there are 3x USB 3.0 ports. Invest in a powered USB hub if you need to plug in more than just a keyboard and mouse (Because who wants to game on a laptop keyboard and touch pad unless they had no choice?) * USB-C connector is data only; does not output video * There is no optical disc drive. Not a big deal since USB drives are cheap nowadays, but it would have been nice to have. * The touch pad doesn't seem to have the capability to scroll window contents like a lot of laptops have on the side of the touch pad that I can tell. You will be making good friends with the Up, Down, Page Up, and Page Down keys if you don't want to use the scroll bars in your window(s) and don't have an external mouse hooked up. * You have to be slightly heavy handed on the touch pad but this may come down to user preference. Personally I'm fine with it and I'll be hooking an external mouse to it whenever possible anyway. * Keyboard back lights are not RGB. They are solid blue/light blue in color, you can toggle them on or off, and set a few different levels of brightness on them. Not a big deal for me though; I'm just happy being able to see the keyboard in the dark. * There is pretty minimal bloatware pre-installed, but it is no where near as bad as other computer brands. I would consider it a reasonable amount to be honest. * The dual GPU set up can be confusing at first. A tip for anyone first time to dual GPU: If you're having trouble figuring out why some applications are performing badly and they don't seem to be using the nVidia GPU; close the program, then right click it, and chose Run application with GPU > High performance nVidia. You can also set up an application profile in the nVidia control panel for your program to use which ever GPU you want if you want the program to always run with that. Despite some faults with this laptop, overall, I like this laptop a lot."}, {"name": "GPTM1", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2019", "title": "Had to return due to \u201cAir raid siren\u201d", "review_text": "Looking for a laptop that can handle my Rift S games. and for causal screen tasks (gaming, video editing, browsing the web) Laptop is very nice, got it on sale too.

If I plug in more than one USB device (USB-C + Type A or two Type A), then my externally attached USB mouse stops working and the second device may or may not work depending on the type of device plugged in.  It does not matter if I am using a high end Logitech mouse or a cheap wired MS USB mouse, the USB port is just functionally not working.  Yes, this could be driver issues but, Intel and NVIDIA drivers are up to date and say they are functioning.  So, this leads me to believe it is a BIOS issue. By the way, the BIOS is useless because it has practically no options loaded into it.  I don't know how a company in the year 2019 gets away with creating a BIOS that has literally no options available for edit like this but, Acer has pulled this off.  This also leads to my suspicions about my USB problem being a BIOS issue.  If I could mess around or even determine the method the USB is configured by the BIOS, I may be able to resolve my own problem! Also, be advised the USB-C port may be a USB v3.1 Gen 2 port but, it is NOT a Thunderbolt 3 port so do not expect TB3 devices to work with this laptop.  I can't confirm it is an actual Gen 2 port because, like I said above, I cannot connect two USB devices to this laptop....I don't know why it has 4 USB ports because they can't be used.

Pros: - It is SUCH A GOOD BARGAIN. - The graphics card is a 1660 Ti instead of the cheaper and worse 1650 card, it\u2019s very powerful and can easily handle anything you throw at it. - It ships with an M.2 SSD for the Operating system and storage that is incredibly fast. - It includes a extra open M.2 slot so you can install your own M.2 for more and super fast storage. - It includes an open hard drive bay for larger additional storage, and ships with the hard drive harness and connecting cable so you don\u2019t have to buy anything except the hard drive and it\u2019s a super easy installation. - The screen is 144hz, I\u2019ve never seen a laptop for anywhere near this price that has a 144hz panel, that\u2019s amazing! Once you\u2019ve seen this, you won\u2019t be able to go back to 60hz. - The processor is great, ram is great, storage is great and super fast - The track pad and keyboard are both phenomenal, way better than I thought they would be for a laptop of this price. Cons: - The laptop can get really hot sometimes unless you kick it into the overdrive fan mode. - The overdrive fan mode is extremely loud and is really only usable if you\u2019re wearing a headset, otherwise you literally can\u2019t even hear the game audio over the fans. - The power cord is in a weird place on the left side of the case, it either runs towards you and sits on top of your wires (the usb plugs) or it goes away from you and sits right next to the heat vents on the left side. - The power brick gets INCREDIBLY hot when the laptop is used for more than an hour under heavy load, you could literally burn your hand on the power brick if you touched it for too long. - The laptop ships with a lot of bloatware installed like Norton and other things, it\u2019s not great uninstalling those, but I got most of it uninstalled and then it was fine."}, {"name": "Bernardo Zorrilla ", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2019", "title": "Best bang for your buck in gaming laptops!", "review_text": "Absolutely love my Acer Predator Helios 300.

I opted to go ahead and buy a 1TB ssd and it was extremely easy to install. Battery life isnt anything special, but I expected that and no high expectations for a 59w. So far looks like during gaming or heavy usage in video editing, 3 hours at best. Basic internet and office work, 5-6.

Everything feels so buttery smooth. 4. The 1660 Ti is the real deal. It is not the MAX-Q version. One heck of a GPU. One weird thing to note: 1. There is a software bug that if you connect an external monitor and in display settings you decide to display to the external monitor and the external monitor alone, and you use an external controller like I do (USB controller), any click of the buttons or movement of the joysticks destroys the FPS of the game you're playing and make it literally unplayable. The workaround is to choose \"Extend desktop\" and just run the game on your external monitor and leave the laptop screen as just the desktop. Note: This bug was not present on a dell gaming laptop. Because of the extend desktop, this workaround works and there's no real issue here, just something to note.

The new version of Windows 10 has a lot of issues that still need to be worked out, but this laptop benchmarks way above anything else at this price point. They keyboard feels nice, the backlighting is great, solid 100+FPS on all games Ultra settings so far. The one-button Overclock (Turbo) is nice as well but put headphones on because as others have said, the fans get pretty noisy. So far so good, I will update if anything comes up but definitely worth the buy. I purchased a Samsung Odyssey+ to go with it and the VR capabilities of this laptop are pretty insane. The Windows Mixed Reality Portal has a lot of issues that need to be worked out, and Windows crashes quite a bit when dealing with VR, i.e. make sure you plug the USB cable in BEFORE the HDMI cable or else your system will hang...what the heck? No one told us that, I had to dig it up on a forum post, let's just hope they patch out some of the bugginess of WMR soon. The audio isn't too bad, if you're just chilling watching a movie, it's fine. I use a pair of Bluetooth Noise Cancelling headphones so even with the fans on MAX setting, I can't hear anything except what I'm watching/playing.

It\u2019s all plastic but their is very little flex in the keyboard, the frame is solid and there is almost no flex in the screen. Reviews have stated the keyboard deck and cover are aluminum. This one definitely isnt - its a very hard plastic. There is significant light bleed around the bezel edges when the screen is dark. It almost appears as if the bezels are too tightly attached to the display. I don\u2019t see the bleed much when the screen is displaying graphics/programs/colors. It\u2019s extremely quiet, but that\u2019s probably because I\u2019m just sitting setting it up and don\u2019t have any programs running. Turning on the turbo fan switch makes the thing suuuuuuuper loud. So far, I really like it and can\u2019t wait to see it running some games. I want to compare it to the Lenovo Y740 I picked up the other day too (that is when that one finally ships in late August...) I\u2019ll give some more updates as we screw around with it. It\u2019s fairly heavy and bulky. It\u2019s definitely not a slim design but overall not too bad. Its a very good size display. I had purchased a 17 inch Lenovo Y740 as a second laptop but cancelled it for a 15 inch Y740. Im very happy I did this because I feel the 15 inch displays are perfect sizes for a laptop after using the Acer 300. The keyboard travel time isn\u2019t bad. I love this keyboard because it has the keypad included. The keyboard doesnt feel cramped with the added keypad even though this is a 15 inch machine. Keystrokes feel slightly mushy when pressing. The keys are illuminated in light blue which can be made darker or lighter with two of the F keys. The blue light isnt annoyingly bright or obnoxious like some laptops I have seen. There are a few bloatware programs added by Acer onto this laptop. I would suggest a clean install of Win10 and then heading to Acer to download their Predator Sense program. This is one Acer program you definitely want to keep and use. If not a clean install, do your research and find what programs to remove. IMO, immediately Nortons should come off.

Almost 90 degrees celsius hot. The fan at full blast can lower it to at least 75 degrees but this full blast is loud. Like there is a jet plane 30 miles outside your room but right in front of you and not as loud. And here is the USB and other connection problem, still. The others made the same complaints before by the looks of it. If more than 3 powerful devices are connected (USB or blue tooth and etc.) The whole thing disconnects and tries to reconnect. I have to disconnect the thing I don't use at the moment and reconnect if I need it again. For a powerful laptop, it is disappointing. My main concern is the heat and the USB connection.

Spent over an hour with Predator support. I was very excited for this product and will update my review if I ever get my exchange. ***Updating After Receiving Replacement*** This laptop is a beast. It can handle any game you throw at it. Features: Turbo button. If you're anything like me the idea of tinkering and micro managing settings seems tedious. \"Say no more!\" says Acer and they provide a turbo button. With 1 press you automatically overclock your gpu and cpu and boost your fans to get the most out of your latpop! Predator button: Another wonderful addition. With a press of a button you can bring up a management screen to adjust everything. You can set bandwidth priority you can set fan speed. If you like to tinker, this is wonderful. Hardware: This laptop is an amazing piece of equipment for the price. Especially if you catch it on sale like I did for prime day ($999 are you kidding me?!). You would be hard-pressed to build a desktop with this much power for the same price, including a 144hz monitor. Speaking of 144 hz: As someone who has never played at anything over 60hz this is amazing. Its so smooth! The 1660ti makes gaming at 1080/ultra a breeze for most games. The not so good: While the monitor is literally amazing, there are some spots along the edges during black screens. I assume this is just something we have to live with as most reviews mention it. The hard drive expansion, while not difficult warrants some research. Instead of simply having a plug and play SATA cable for a second hard drive acer sends you a cable and a rubber case of sorts. It is  not particularly difficult to install but you can damage your laptop if you don't know what you're doing. At the very least watch a YouTube video. Overall: This laptop is amazing for the price. This is THE BEST budget gaming option of the year.

AND build a new PC to replace it.  Don't think I'll be spending a grand plus on a laptop again, at least not from here. ORIGINAL REVIEW FOR REFERENCE: Picked this up as a potential desktop replacement (was running an i5 8600K, GeForce 1070Ti with 16GB RAM) and so far, it's looking like this is gonna do the trick nicely.  I'll be sure to update this as time goes on, as I get a better feel for how it behaves, but here's a quick run-down of what I've found: Pros -Bright, smooth display.  Best I've had on a laptop yet, but isn't quite as vibrant as a Surface tablet -High refresh rate means you see more frames per second than you normally would! -Graphics card is DECEPTIVELY BEEFY.  Was playing Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order at 70-120fps! -Good CPU ensures regular functional use remains snappy and responsive. -Mini Display Port output means you can plug this into a bigger, high-refresh monitor for even bigger, sharper picture Cons -Battery life goes kaput rapidly off the charger; if that's fine, no problem (it's fine for me) -Fans get pretty loud when things kick up to keep the system cool. -Not sure why, but HDMI out performance was extremely poor on my 4K display (even running 1080p resolution) -Honestly, CPU gets a tad toastier than I'd like it to during extended gameplay (WoW Classic was fine, The Old Republic wasn't really) Long term, it'd be nice to have a computer that can handle the games I primarily play, which admittedly isn't very graphically intensive, but I wanted enough beef to play demanding titles when the occasion arises, and this knocks my expectations out of the ballpark for this price range.  Typically I'm just playing Hearthstone, Hades, Slay the Spire and WoW Classic on the weekends, but if I wanna pick up a AAA banger here and there, having that option is great, and this laptop brings it hard.  Considering this all runs off a 180-watt power supply, I'm pretty stunned at the efficiency of this thing.  Maybe I'm good to hang up the desktop for good now!  We'll have to wait and see. It's nuts to think you can get a gaming experience this robust in a 16-inch package to go.  What a time to be alive.  Generally I'd advise to never \"cheap out\" when deciding what you'd like to get; this is a bit pricier than some other laptops, but it's got a few baseline features that you should be looking out for if you don't want to be bottlenecked unexpectedly: -GTX 1660Ti/graphics in general:  1050Ti is good for casual use and I generally try to stay away from mobile AMD offerings, but this has enough power to be relevant right now and not be lagging behind, unlike the 1050Ti.  I'm afraid even the 1650 is already behind the curve, so dipping that low to save a few bucks could really cost you in the long run.  If you're concerned about performance, I can not only recommend 1660Ti laptops, but advise you to steer clear of anything below that, and beware anything more powerful due to the price premium (questionable gains at exponentially higher cost).  If you're just playing old games and deck builders, 1660Ti is a bit too much hog; go for 1650 or 1050. -DUAL-CHANNEL RAM.  Two RAM sticks means dual-channel; beware laptops with a single RAM slot!  Even if you get 16GB RAM in one stick, your performance is going to suffer substantially if you're stuck in one-stick, single-channel RAM operation.  PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH!  Single-channel negatively effects both games and normal laptop operation! -144hz display!  These should be standard now; it's a waste to have a decent video card in a laptop if you can't even see the frames (60hz still seems to be standard in laptops, sadly, meaning any FPS over 60 just goes into a black hole).  You'd be surprised even with card games how much a high refresh rate monitor can improve the overall feel of gameplay."}, {"name": "William Bolton", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2019", "title": "Best Value in a Gaming Computer", "review_text": "Granted I've only had this laptop in my possession for a couple of days, but so far I like it a lot. Gaming on a 15.6\" screen will take some getting used to. (My previous gaming laptops were ASUS ROG models with 17 inch screens, and my desktop has a 27\" monitor.) but the picture quality is the best I've seen. The Predator has some great components with the 9th gen i7 processor, the Nvidia 1660 Ti GPU, 16 GB of RAM and an NVMe SSD. The SSD is 256 GB so I added a Seagate Firecuda 2TB hybrid drive for an additional expense of $80. In addition, the Killer networking hardware/software seems to work very well. That's the good. The bad is that it comes with Windows 10 (but what's a practical alternative?), and Microsoft is very aggressive in pushing its services. It can be difficult if not impossible to remove them. I make my own choices for browser, search engine, email clients, etc, but when I removed Edge I got notifications every time I started up on my startup screen pushing Edge and not once but twice. ( I think and hope I finally removed it. I'm not a fan of advertising, and I don't trust Microsoft.) And I'm not willing to trust \"the cloud\", so Dropbox and cloud storage were refused. I've downloaded several games onto the hybrid drive but only played Destiny 2 for about an hour and a half and a little of Age of Wonders III. As I said the graphical quality is the best I've seen, but Destiny 2 did freeze after I'd been playing for an hour or so which I assume was due to the GPU overheating (and I do use a notebook cooler), but I'm also assuming there are things I can do to prevent this in the future. For one thing, the game was optimized by the Nvidia GeForce Experience software and I'll have to look at their selections. I should also adjust the fan speeds, but I haven't looked into this yet either. So, if I should have to amend this review (and recommendation) in the future I will do so, but so far I'm very impressed with what Acer has provided and at what cost. I gave battery life and camera quality three stars because the laptop will always be plugged in, and I'll rarely if ever use the camera (though from what I've seen in YouTube reviews the image quality is certainly IMO acceptable for ordinary uses). Update: On the day after I wrote this review, I played some Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Dragon Age: Inquisition, WOW, Alpha Centauri and more Destiny 2. GeForce Experience optimized the games at ultra quality. I tinkered with the fan settings setting them slightly higher than standard (about 4000-4200 rpms and will fine adjust this more). The games looked great and played well without any problem. The fans did make some noise, but it's a whoosh and not a whine, and for me not terribly intrusive. As I said, I'll adjust the fan speed some more and may be able to reduce it even further. The speakers by the way are great with excellent sound quality and volume for a laptop. The fan noise never interfered with the sound at my settings. Again, well done, Acer. Two months later, and I'm still very impressed with this computer. I installed the new Crytek Neon Noir Ray Tracing Benchmark for ray-tracing effects without an RTX gpu, ran it fullscreen at 1920x1080 and ultra and got a score of 5529 with very fluid playback and frame rates that varied from about 45 to the upper 70s. The benchmark would seem to be quite the workout for a system and the Acer got a commendable result IMO."}, {"name": "D.

The first was by another large brand and was a total bust,  returned within the 30 day amazon window due to serious hardware issues right out of the box. This one had restored my faith in buying gaming laptops online without being able to \"test\" them out. If you understand what you're getting with this machine and have a very clear picture what it is you want out of it, then this is a fantastic machine. The graphics card is powerful enough to run most modern games at mid to high settings with zero issues. The powerful CPU and mid tier specs set you up at a good starting point to boot up and game, literally right out of the box, with little need to really add anything other than a good gaming mouse. The screen is one of the better ones and usually can be found on more expensive laptops. I have very minimal light bleed on mine and it's not noticeable at all during normal use. The keyboard is comfortable to work on although the letters are a bit squished together so it did take me a little bit to get used to. Upgrading is super simple. I had a second SSD hard drive installed within 5 minutes of popping the bottom off the laptop and there is still space to add yet another drive. At this time, I've got a second 500 gig drive to complement the main 250g drive and I also have a portable 250g Samsung rugged ssd drive that uses the 3.1 USB C port should I need even more space. This laptop, for me, is not a replacement for my desktop. It's just a really nice partner to it for those days I want to snoodle up on the couch and game with my dog on my lap. It runs warmer than some other laptops but this is normal. It's a gaming laptop. It's actually quite good for gaming laptop standards. The fans work really well but can get loud so you'll need headphones or a cooling pad underneath to help with that. I use a cooling pad and the noise doesn't bother me or anyone else when I decide to game a bit while watching a movie with the boyfriend on the couch. I installed an app that monitors CPU and GPU temps and it's never gone above 75c while gaming. While doing regular stuff, its in the low 30s and the fans run near silent. Battery is poor so stay plugged in and you'll be fine while you game. When not gaming and just doing regular stuff, the battery might last 3.5 hours if you dim the screen to 50 percent. This honest doesn't affect me much. When I use it, I stay pluggef in. If I need longer battery life, I have two other laptops specifically purchased for productivity that I can use to solve that issue. It's quite small and light for how powerful it is and for being a 15 inch monitor. I love that because as a female who often likes to game while she travels, I don't want to lug around heavy bulky gear just to do that. This little guy lets me pop it into my thin laptop sleeve along with it's charger, which is also a nice compact size, and my gaming mouse and earbud headphones and I'm good to go. Also, it doesn't scream gamer the colors are a soft white and blue and the design itself is nice but not aggressive like their Helios 300 of last year, which I purchased as a gift for my sister.  Happy girl here. All in all, I'm really happy with this purchase and can see that this laptop will last me at least 4 to 5 years gaming-wise because of the powerful components Acer used. This little fella is definitely a declaration against all other gaming laptop companies out there. For what I needed and wanted, it's perfect.

Eventually I noticed that some of the LEDs were flashing and when I went to open it and see what was going on, it was incredibly hot to the touch. The fans were not on. I powered it on and got the fans going and it cooled down. This happened a couple times and generally I kept it unplugged and powered off, to avoid this weird overheat-while-sleeping issue. I tried upgrading the OS and BIOS to see if it would fix the issue, but it didn't seem to. Eventually, it got stuck in the overheating state for some amount of time while I wasn't around. I'm assuming it was for hours, and when I tried to power it on, it couldn't see the internal disk, so it wouldn't boot. I booted with a Linux USB drive and it seems that the memory and CPU are fine, but Linux couldn't see the boot disk, either.

I had been researching budget gaming laptops for a long time, and finally decided that I was going to buy this. I bought it for $1200 and before it could ship I saw it go on sale for $999 for prime day. So I quickly canceled that order and bought it at the sale price, which sold out fast. Thanks Amazon! As of the time of this review it is on sale again for $999, if you are on the fence, don't be, buy it now! I love this laptop. It plays all modern games I have on Ultra with zero issues. I have about 100 hours now in the Witcher 3, simply beautiful. I have tested other games such as metro Exodus, ff14, AC: Odyssey, Farcry 5, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, etc. All perform flawlessly on max settings However, the machine does get quite hot. As other reviewers have pointed out it is normal for gaming laptops to operate between 75 - 90 celcius. I've also noticed this laptop is cooler when you are in a cooler environment. I spend half my time in Mexico and half in Seattle. While gaming in Seattle the laptop doesn't go past 85, while in Mexico it will easily reach mid 90s. Unfortunately in this case since it comes undervolted to -.125 there's not much you can do besides setting fans to Max in the predator sense application, which definitely will cool it back down to 78-82. I also always use it on my lap with a laptop cooler, which does not affect the temperature for better or worse. Aside from gaming, it also handles everyday computing excellently. I do suggest getting a 2.5\" SSD for additional storage. The keyboard is very good, even though it is strangely placed. The mousepad is a good size, but is hard to click effectively, so I suggest getting a decent gaming mouse. The screen hinge is like firm butter, and the top of the lid and keyboard area is aluminum, hardly seen in a laptop at this price point. In my opinion, it is going to be hard to beat this laptop unless you spend more than $2k.

The fans go all the time, it doesn't switch to passive, so it is always noisy, but again a constant low wishing of fans is fine. However what is not fine is the tractor that I now have sat next to me. I'm not a farmer. The GPU fan's bearings (I guess) have worn. Now even on idle it sounds like an idling Massey Ferguson on small jackhammer being constantly operated by some Acer dwelling Fraggle. Again, this is fine when I'm gaming in the evening, but not fine during the day when I'm working. It's 6 months old, it has the Aeroblade 3D 4th gen, a fancy fan it seems, BUT possibly too fancy... I'm sure any intolerance in the spacing of the aluminium blades will upset the balance and cause a bearing to wear out. This kind of thing is not an issue with plastic/vinyl fans, which wouldn't be so easily bent during installation. I contacted support who agreed it needed be sent into repair. But this is my only unit as my backup machine, (that this replaced) is not up to task anymore. So I want to buy a replacement fan and fix it myself. Can I find the right fan anywhere? NOPE. I also added an SSD with the provided adaptor, as a trained engineer, this was no issue, but I'm sure it will give them the option to wag a \"voided warranty\" finger my way anyway and see it sent back in the same state. Acer aren't going to send me a replacement fan... Of course, it has to be sent back in for repair, I understand this. And honestly I'm concerned the fan could seize at any minute. Rendering the laptop a brick. I've been building my own desktop PCs for 30 years, and only now just switched to this laptop as I had to move to somewhere remote where the electricity is very unreliable, and I knew it was going to be a pain in the ass. Every rig I've ever built has been operated for 2-5 years without any issues, and my last one - that just retired was going for 10. This is with 16 hour a day usage 7 days a week 8 hours of which each day saw the hardware utilised to high percentages of their viable loads. This would be a 4 to 5 star laptop had it lasted at least until its warranty without issues. But hey... It is what it is.

Can't change boot order, upgrade storage, or disable UEFI for Linux", "review_text": "I bought this to replace a 7 year old Linux gaming computer (dual-boot, multi-drive) with a corroded power supply, expecting to install a couple extra hard drives, while still playing a few games on the original Windows drive it shipped with. After a little research, it looked like I wouldn't have a lot of trouble installing drivers for the hardware that comes with this model, and the price was reasonably low compared with System76, so I went ahead and ordered it. BIOS and hardware upgrades: Once the 2nd drive I ordered arrived (separate packages, couple days later), I proceeded to install the 1 TB drive along with the 500 GB drive from my old system, using the upgrade kit which came with this computer. Taking apart the computer was fairly straightforward, but because Linux requires you to disable Secure Boot, I proceeded into the BIOS to enable booting from USB and turn off Secure Boot and UEFI. The BIOS password was NOT set, and I was allowed to add one of my own, but all the settings related to security and boot order were still greyed out. Despite installing 2 additional drives, and being allowed to set a password for one of them, I was not allowed to boot from anything except the 500 GB drive this computer shipped with or any kind of external media. I called the support number in the pamphlet that came with the computer, and asked about this, but was told that Acer locks the BIOS on all computers shipped through Amazon in order to \"protect\" customers from changing things that might break the computer if they don't know what they're doing. He explained that all computer vendors do this to one extent to another, such as Apple with iPhones, and refused to provide me any means to unlock it no matter how technical I am. He continued that if I want to upgrade anything, I should call Acer's main customer service line and order it from them, instead of trying to modify it myself. At this point, I demanded a refund because the item was materially different from what was advertised, and effectively unusable for my purposes as a result, but he refused because the package was already opened. I pointed out the product description did not list the BIOS being locked, and based on forum postings about this model on Acer's website, locking the BIOS did not appear to be a standard configuration for this model, but he stated that's what Acer wanted for Amazon-shipped computers, and that they're under no obligation to disclose this information prior to purchase, so I replied I will simply complain to Amazon and seek a refund through them. I did try contacting Acer's customer support number listed on Amazon, and on their own website; after a few days of trying, I did eventually reach someone (average wait time of 60 minutes), who ultimately confirmed Acer intends to limit customers' ability to change boot sequence for their \"protection\". Keyboard: This was a real nuisance. The 1 key, Q key, Z key, and I think a couple others make a distinct \"clicking\" noise when I press them, sometimes don't press in properly, and feel like they will pop out or otherwise break within about a month or so of use. It also has some weird light-up pattern that runs from left to right and flickers a bit as soon as it lights up. Almost looks like something is wrong, and might burn out in a few months. Battery life: While waiting for the 2nd hard drive to arrive, I played Elder Scrolls Online over Wifi a little bit. Computer was fast enough to handle it, but the battery died within about an hour, despite being brand new. Given how batteries decline over time, I worry about how it will perform after a few years. Screen quality: Says it's 1920x1080, but looks a little pixelated, which is kind of weird. I don't know how to describe it, but the pixels look a little larger than I'd expect, and the computer defaulted to a lower resolution out of the box for some reason.

It is so fast that the only limitation in speed I have seen is the internet connection. I have played Middle Earth, Shadow of War for about 10 hours so far and not had a single problem or glitch. It does get hot if you don't crank up the fans, but the controls for that are just a simple button push and it goes into Turbo mode. It has a feature called Predator Sense, which gives you control of overclocking the GPU and adjusting the fan speeds, plus it gives you a history graph of the CPU/GPU temps and processing percentages. Under full gaming load playing Shadow of War I typically see temps of about 140 degrees Fahrenheit. When using the internet, MS word and Powerpoint, all at the same time, it isn't even working hard at all and the fans are just left on auto. It doesn't even get warm when I'm not gaming. I added a Samsung 1TB 870 EVO SSD the first day I got it to load my games on and it took me about 10 minutes to complete the installation. I'm no computer wiz either, it was a very easy addition. I plan to add another M.2 SSD in the future, and upgrade the RAM, but right now I am very happy with it. I highly recommend this laptop if you think it is what you are looking for.

Battery life is not the greatest, but I knew that before I got it. On average it says it has about 3 hours remaining when using it mobile, though I have never used it unplugged for more than about and hour or so. Also, it will not let you use Turbo mode unless it is plugged in which is reasonable since it would probably drain the battery really fast anyway. I carry it with me to school in my Swiss Gear 1900 backpack and it doesn't seem to add much weight to my load. Also the WiFi reception is very good and almost always has full signal anywhere I use it. Because of the aluminum body, it feels very high quality.

I got it on sale when it was $920 USD. Pros: - The 1660TI is excellent. I played Gears 5, Siege, Black Ops 3 Zombies, Rocket League, etc. all at 120-144 fps and medium settings. - The keyboard feels really nice. I'm very picky and this one is quality. - As with any gaming laptop, it will get hot. There is a convenient button on the laptop labelled \"TURBO\" which ramps up the fan speed. It will keep the laptop at good temperatures, but it will be loud. I have a HyperX Cloud 2 headset which cancels noise pretty well, so I barely hear it. If you don't have a headset on to cancel out some noise, it will be too loud. - Great for taking to a friend's house for some LAN gaming or taking your gaming setup on a flight. I brought mine with me for my internship across the country. - Installing an extra SSD is very easy (M.2 or SATA). I installed a 1TB SATA SSD as soon as I got it. It took under 10 minutes. Look up a video and it's simple. This goes with a con though, which is that you are basically forced to install an SSD (or use an external drive) since the given 256 GB SSD is not enough for installing games. Cons: - 15 inch screen. A 17 inch screen is bigger/heavier, but a bigger screen would be better IMO. Going from a 24 inch desktop monitor to a 15 inch laptop monitor for gaming is a big difference. - The refresh rate is great, but the video quality is meh. I don't know the technical term for it, but on dark screens, there is a white glow on the top of the monitor. Usually this is not noticeable for every day use, but when watching game cinematics or movies, it can be noticed during dark scenes. - Very little storage. I bought mine with 256 GB. That leaves no room for games, unless you only play one medium size game. Otherwise, you absolutely will need an external drive or to install an SSD of your own. - The touchpad is horrible. You will definitely need an external mouse, but if you're gaming, you'd need one anyway. It's annoying, but not a dealbreaker. Keep in mind that I come from Mac where the touchpad is the best ever made, so I may just have too high of expectations. - The battery life is horrible. You could say this is a con, but I don't know why you would ever NOT plug in your gaming laptop. Gaming laptops are nice for easily moving between setups, but should always be plugged in while gaming. I leave it plugged in on a desk. Gaming takes a lot of power and you really shouldn't expect to game off battery power.

One main concern I had was screen quality since other reviews were upset at the backlight bleed through and I thought that might be a deal breaker. I am very happy to report that the blacklight bleed through for me is absolutely unnoticeable during normal use and playing games. The only time I see the bleed through is during the start screen. The screen is crisp and the colors are good. I am sure there are better screens out there but this one I would say is over all Good - maybe even Excellent. The refresh rate of 144hz also makes for very smooth game play - I really notice it smoothness on Fortnight on max graphic settings and it runs Classic Wow on max graphic setting very well. Another Pro that will a small amount of software tweaking I am able to get the trackpad to work just like my macbook pro - this is really mircosoft windows adjustments but as far as sensitivity it is almost as good as the mac book - its like an 8 out of 10 (macbook pro is a 10 out of 10) - most non-macbook trackpads are horrible that I tested so I was pleasantly surprised. Cons - these are minor: (1) The number pad on the right is off a little because they put the special \"Predator\" graphics key where normally the \"NumLk\" goes - and i adjacently hit it all the time. I think they could have put that key or switch somewhere else. (2) I wish they had the F keys setup like the macbook pro where I could adjust volume without having to toggle the \"Fn\" key. Right now this requires two hand to change the volume from the key board because the volume keys are the \"up\" and \"down\" arrows. (3) the way the \"delete\" key is setup along with the placing of the backspace key - they are both not normal to a standard key board so I end up accidentally hitting them or not hitting them when typing if I am not thinking about it. (4) the track pad is not centered on the laptop. It is further to the left and since I am right handed it make me have to place my right hand further to the right than what is comfortable. (5) The power cord and the way it attaches the computer. I am soiled with the old macbook pro magsafe connection and I wish this did something similar. Multiple times I have pulled this computer off the table because either me or my kids tripped on the cable. Also the cable has a large plastic piece just a few inches from the connector and it seems to get in the way of effectively running the cable around for me. (6) the usd ports are all on the side and close to the front - so this makes it difficult for me to hook in my USB mouse and key pad and have them right next to the computer since hey overlap and hit the key pad. I wish there was two port on the back of the PC or at least on the side but far back. Overall, I am very please with the setup and my gripes are very minor.

UPDATE: Amazon refused to send a replacement, saying that my only option was to return the product for a refund of the Black Friday price and then pay for a replacement at full price. Luckily Acer customer service has offered to take it in for repairs. The customer service representative was very understanding and professional. If they return the product in proper working order then I'll update my rating. Still frustrated that that I had to return it ( it's still unprecedented in the 25+ years I've been working with computers), but glad that Acer took the time to hire quality representatives who take quality control issues seriously. So, I really wanted to like this laptop. I purchased it on sale as part of a black-Friday promotion. The specs were good, and I read enough reviews to expect a decent build quality. In many respects this proved to be true: The overall feel, the hinges, everything seemed fine...Except the keyboard. The very first day of use a key popped off. No big deal, I thought to myself, it probably got a bit jostled during shipping. Since then a key has popped off almost every day. Not the same key, mind you, but exclusively on the number pad each time. It's super frustrating. I don't want to return the computer, at this point it would be a substantial inconvenience...but I have not given it \"hard use\". It hasn't left my house and isn't even my 'daily driver'. It doesn't get thrown around in a backpack. I haven't typed a 70,000 word dissertation on it. I've written a handful of emails...that's it. I had initially hoped this would make a nice travel workstation, I'm not concerned that it's incapable of filling that (or any other) meaningful role. One star might seem brutal when most of the laptop functions fine. I can concede that. But the keyboard is a fundamental to the operation of the device. It's technology that we mastered decades ago, and it's ridiculous that it should break so easily after very limited and very gentle use. The laptop it replaced ( A Lenovo) had lots of keyboard flex, weak hinges, and a terrible trackpad...but the keyboard worked until the day it replaced without issue. It survived multiple military moves and international travel. This thing didn't survive thanksgiving weekend. I'm debating returning the thing and am frustrated that I spent the money."}, {"name": "SeaHunter", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2019", "title": "Revised: Fired right up, lightening fast,  I tried installing X-Plane 11, screen went BLACK", "review_text": "I am revising the review as I was able to fix the issue with the BLACK screen after every windows restart attempt.

At the time of this writing it is playing all my games at high frame rates. I have been building computers since 1996 and started on the original half-life. I have had many gaming rigs all built by me and a few Alienware Laptops. To have such a thin fast computer that does not suck.... It's actually amazing to me for the price. You could spend much more and get much less if you're not careful. The only things that are slightly disappointing is I think the screen is a little bit thin for the laptop case and it's flexible a little bit. Not a problem if you're careful but I could see on the go students beating it up and breaking the screen. I noticed that it does like to get hot but not so much that it stops working. I will be buying a slender laptop cooling pad. It also shows fingerprints really really easy and kind of makes it look nasty if you don't clean it often. The color of the case shows every fingerprint. All minor things that most people wouldn't worry about but it's good to read this review and know what you're getting. I can absolutely recommend this computer as of December 2019. Know that laptops are pretty hard to upgrade if not impossible with the exception of adding a little memory or a hard drive. I will probably by a more powerful one in a few years I'm pass this one down to a family member who doesn't need the power. If you buy close to the review date you will not be disappointed but six or eight months from now who knows. I got a Black Friday deal I'm under $1,000 but it was worth every penny. Absolutely absolutely recommend. My last tip is that it must be plugged in for gaming to get decent frame rates.

Amazing laptop for the price, really good desgin (thermals aswell) and quite compact compared to last year's model. There is back light bleed but only noticeable when displaying something completely dark/black (for example when laptop is booting up.) and some back light bleed is in all models of helios 300 so don't worry about it. Also black light bleed is not noticeable at all during normal use or whilst gaming. However, if you see more than expected back light bleed, do contact amazon tech help and sort it out. Battery life is actually better than expected for this power hungry gaming laptop with such a small battery. I highly recommend getting a 2.5\" or m.2 nvme ssd. There is one empty slot for 2.5\" hdd/ssd and one empty m.2 slot (with another m.2 slot having 256gb ssd pre-installed). I'd suggest 1tb m.2 nvme ssd which goes for around $100 on amazon. Keybaord is really good, though it comes with just blue backlight & no rgb, that rgb model for same price is only available in Australia. You can get rgb model on amazon but you will have to pay more and you will get 512gb m.2 ssd instead of 256gb which is installed in this one. Trackpad is also better than expected since you usually have low expectations from trackpad in a gaming laptop, where you would plug external mouse for gaming anyway. USB-C port does not support thunderbolt 3 or video output, it's just for connecting external USB-C devices, or dongles if you want more ports. Display is really good, 144hz refresh rate ~ 3ms response time makes it one of the best displays in laptop of this price point & bezels are way smaller compared to last year's model. It also feels and looks much lighter than last year's model thanks to compact degsin and actual weight decrease of about 250g from last year's model. Do enable turbo mode (by pressing the turbo button) if you do anything demanding as it will increase the fan speed, so no thermal throttling, it would increase cpu power limit and overclock gpu to extreme. You will get better performance for both gpu & cpu and even ram this way. In my opinion it's the best laptop for the price (I paid $1200 but you can get it for $999 on prime day) if you do photo/video editing or gaming/high performance demanding work."}, {"name": "Tone3Stark", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2019", "title": "Good quality and a lot of bang for the buck.", "review_text": "Not as thin as a razor but not as thick as an Alienware, very powerful and I can play everything seamlessly from regular games to VR.

This is a stress crack that has happened on my old 2006 Macbook Pro before they redesigned it with a thicker bezel. This issue on this computer surprises me, because, 1)This issue with other laptops had been addressed far in the past by other laptop makers and 2) I expect higher quality for this, a higher end, laptop but from an engineering standpoint, it doesn't surprise me because the screen, itself, is incredibly thin and the top of the laptop has A LOT of flex in it that I didn't notice initially, until, when I went to move the computer, I cradled the laptop in my hand with my finger tips bracing the open top, and to my horror, the screen noticeably flexed. I don't know if this computer has been updated but I just CANNOT and would not recommend this computer based on the build quality alone (which is pretty important for a mobile computer, IMHO!) Purchased 08/2019: I really like this laptop. It's powerful, and it fills my needs well. I use programs such as Premiere Pro, After Effects and Unity and I also play games like Apex Legends and Fortnite on it. This computer handles these tasks well. There are few things that really annoy me about this laptop. The keyboard is off center by A LOT. I'm constantly hitting the Predator button when I code and it gets to be incredibly annoying as time wears on. I don't use the number pad often, if ever, so I could have done without it and that would have helped with the centering of the keyboard. The shift key on the right is also too small. The second thing that bothers me is the speaker(s). They are in the front of the computer so if the computer is on your lap, the sound will probably be quite muffled. When it's on a hard surface, it sounds better but the sound itself is not of great quality. For reference, my 2012 MacBook Air's speakers have a more full sound and are head and shoulders above the speakers in this laptop. The third thing that bothers me is the fact that the computer cannot adjust brightness appropriately, automatically, when it's removed from AC power (my MacBook Air does). The same goes for when you plug in headphones or unplug them: there is no separate volume for headphones vs. the laptop's speaker. These are things I can generally look past but they bother me enough to keep them in the back of my mind when buying another laptop."}, {"name": "Jordon", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2019", "title": "Great computer for the price - Good review", "review_text": "So I\u2019ve always been a competitive laptop gamer and always want the latest and greatest. I spend many many days researching trying to find that perfect computer and this was a great option. Let me go through the pros and cons... Pros: 144hz screen - never actually had anything over 60hz because it\u2019s hard to get anything higher for cheap so this was a great treat and is buttery smooth. 1660 Ti - probably the main reason a lot of people get this laptop, the graphics card is great, it\u2019s relatively new, has 6gb memory. This card will run circles around the 1050ti and gives desktop GPUs a run for there money. CPU - has a great cpu which is very easily over clockabke via the settings, you can set the speed, fan speed and more. Small bezels - compared to some the bezels on this are quite good, the sides and top are narrow, bottom isn\u2019t too bad at all. Overall a nice size screen for viewing. Keyboard - mine only had a blue black light which is okay because I love blue. The keyboard feels good, nice quality and not too loud. Cons: Battery life is poor - can\u2019t get much use out of it but how often are you not near an outlet Light up logo on lid - really wish you could turn it off makes it look kinda cheesy and gamey, not super professional. All in all this is a great laptop for the money. So should you get this? Well if you want a laptop that is pretty sleek, fast, and can run almost any game on the market at high 60fps or higher. People do mention bad screen bleed, either I got a lucky unit or they are over exaggerating because I have very little if any. I do recommend a ssd addition the 256gb stock is small. There is an option for both a m.2 ssd and or a 2.5\u201d drive. Plenty of room to add storage.

The laptop was in my amazon list for a long time and I finally pulled the trigger at the start of the Covid-19 outbreak. Pros: Gaming- This is what this computer is made for. It seemingly can handle most gaming tasks at recommended settings Screen- The screen is really nice but I do wish it was a little brighter.  However, the screen quality seems top notch in my limited testing of the unit. Keyboard- The keyboard seems really nice. Button feel nice and typing on the laptop is nice and easy. Form Factor- Surprisingly, the computer is relatively slim and lightweight considering the amount of power the unit has. Cons Battery Life- The battery drains quick. This should be expected considering the computer is relatively high-powered and designed for gaming. Design- I hate the design of the computer. It really screams \"GAMING\" with the design. I wish it was more subtle because I am a working professional and I don't like the design. Sound- HOLY MOLY this unit gets really loud and hot! Just playing WoW for about 10 minutes and it starts to cook and the fans get loud. If turbo is enabled then it is insanely loud. Heat- When I purchased this machine I fully anticipated it to get hot but the heat near your fingers is really warm. Right above the function buttons near the turbo button gets extremely hot. Speakers- Sub par and hugely disappointing. Do not get this computer if you need quality built in speakers. Overall, I do like this machine and it does exactly what I needed it to do. The screen is amazing and the performance is really strong and I feel like it will handle most games you throw at it with ease.

Having an ISP screen that can do 144Hz is a grate thing to have on a laptop.

Again not a big deal with this much power in such a small  portable space. Overall, I bought this machine to do PC VR on the go with a budget in mind. This device is without a doubt the best bang for your buck you will get if you want to do Pc VR on the go. Yes it does throttle but only about 5-10% performance and with a laptop cooling pad for $20 this problem goes away altogether. This also means that any less strenuous gaming which is pretty much any non vr game will run flawlessly.

This problem persisted for the entire two months I used this laptop.  100% of the time I would always have to power on, off, then on again for it to boot.

(I do intensive CPU and GPGPU computations.) I have used this laptop for a few months now. Good things: - Good thermal performance. Has the option to quiet the fan in an office or library setting, but has the CoolBoost feature to provide some additional RPM. Even so, I'm using a cooling pad. The CPU is 6 cores so anything that is CPU-intensive will need to have more heat dissipated than a 4 core laptop with the same chassis. They undervolted from the factory which definitely helps cool it down by a few degrees. I really appreciate how quiet it is. It will almost certainly not draw attention in a quiet room. Of course, don't take it for granted - a high ambient temperature will easily nullify all these gains. - The boot time is consistently about 5-6 seconds. Much better than the 15 seconds my previous laptop had even after I replaced its hard drive with an SSD. You can use the PredatorSense software to disable the sound during boot time. Worth noting: - Keyboard keys. I would have preferred a dedicated power button off to the side instead of it being part of the keyboard. I have not accidentally pressed it while cleaning the keyboard but it is of note. As someone who uses the number pad quite frequently, the placement of the right arrow and the 0 key might take a bit of getting used to. The keys themselves have good action through and I have not had any problems with key presses. The sides are white and the WASD and arrow keys have a blue edge to them, which is much better than the red theme of the previous laptop. The backlit is fine but I do not use it at all - the white sides already help with visibility. - Bloatware. As usual, uninstall all the garbage that comes with it. There are a few that you might not want to uninstall, especially the PredatorSense software (activated by the key next to NumLock). I also make sure to regularly clear space, especially after a Windows update. The default storage is 256 GB so it will quickly fill up. - Battery. I have gotten a rather wide variation of battery life. It is definitely not designed to be long-lasting 8-10 hours; you will need to bring your charger for extended periods. Tips to save battery life apply to every laptop. Most important is to dim the screen as much as possible and to minimize the time of tasks that end up increasing RPM, including surfing the web (note the high CPU and RAM usage by Firefox, Chrome, etc; and no videos, streaming!). Unlike my previous laptop, you have to take the bottom lid to expose the battery so you cannot replace it with a larger one. - External monitor. The HDMI works, but if you have a 60 Hz monitor, the laptop screen will also go down to 60 Hz if a video is playing on the monitor, such as a Twitch stream or a YouTube video. If, on the monitor screen, you go to a different tab, you get back 144 Hz on the laptop. The 144 Hz is very smooth and it adds a lot to the experience. - Webcam. Somehow something got messed up during initial configuration, and very early on, the webcam light turned on whenever I watched a video on YouTube. Very strange, almost like the NSA was spying on me. Luckily I do not use the webcam at all and disabled it. For those that do, make sure you fidget around with the settings until it works. - Audio. The speakers are not great, use a headset. And DO make sure to uncheck the \"Enable audio enhancements,\" which may be on by default and produces a much worse sound than if it were disabled. Even a tone-deaf person can tell the difference. Not sure why the option even exists, to be honest. Nitpicks: - Outer design. I don't mind the logo, but I wish that they removed the blue streaks, which detract from a professional look. In terms of bringing this laptop to a meeting or other professional setting, it's on the edge between sleek and tacky, in my opinion. It can be mitigated by putting on some laptop stickers for those who are into that. I have noticed much criticism on the internet about the flashy looks of most gaming laptops, but frankly, I wouldn't be too self-conscious about how your laptop looks. - There is a weird thing where the screen flashes red for a few frames before returning to normal every time it brings up the login screen. This happens both upon startup and after pressing Windows-L. I do not know what is causing this but it is slightly annoying. - There is a moderately loud beep that sometimes happens when I plug in the charger before turning the laptop on or while it is booting, or awaking the laptop from sleep. Also slightly annoying. The loudness of the beep seems to be independent of the speaker volume. Overall, great laptop and great value too. Don't be dissuaded by the number of cons vs. pros in my list, they are very minor compared to all the great things that this device offers."}, {"name": "FromSpace", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2019", "title": "IF YOU GET WEIRD ECHO/SURROUND AUDIO", "review_text": "This is a tip for people that encourage an issue that I did.

(Ever use MSI? Super annoying layout and Fn key combos for a developer editing code.) The BIOS is limited (not much you can do there) and the components aren't really high end, just some obscure name. I immediately upgraded the RAM to 32gb (it has two slots) and the SSD to a 500gb M.2 NVMe Samsung. (Swapped parts with the previous laptop.) Then I made it a Linux laptop, which wasn't too difficult. It works fine with Ubuntu 19.10 and the latest Nvidia driver. No weird compatibility issues so far, even though Acer only supports Windows on this machine. You won't find Acer drivers or PredatorSense, but I've run this a few hours on Ubuntu without any issues. The screen looks good. There is very noticeable backlight bleeding on black backgrounds, but it's not an issue otherwise. Bottom line: you get respectable specs for the price. Battery life is terrible at about 90 minutes.

That was an accident waiting to happen, as my $1100 laptop was getting banged around in a non secured secondary box with one piece of brown paper for padding im guessing? Now for the laptop. STOP LOOKING FOR A LOW BUDGET GAMING PC. This laptop is so slim, so fast, so buttery smooth, you wont find another one like it for the price. This helios 300 with the 1660ti, i7 9th gen processor, 16 gigs of ram, and the AMAZING 144hz full HD screen is an amazing deal for the price! This laptop has ran every game ive thrown at it with high settings at ease, from games like csgo to apex legends and more for countless hours. The only down side ive yet to find about this laptop is the cooling. Maybe someone at acer got tired at their job and smeared the thermal paste anywhere but on my CPU or maybe its just normal that a CPU runs at 90 degrees while playing csgo. Who knows, but you will definitely be wanting a cooling pad with this laptop or Intels XTU's offset undervolt. The tracker pad is precise on the helios, as I have recently found out from MSI that functional track pads aren't in their budget when it comes to the $1k mark. The only down side I have yet to find is the heating issue from the CPU, if I could give any advise it would be to possibly purchase the helios 300 with the i5. Maybe be prepared to under volt the i7 CPU, or wait for it to burn up so you can throw an i5 in it. I have also been informed it is fine for the i7 to reach 90 celcius, but anything further isn't desired. I am also speaking on behalf of my purchase, its not guaranteed that your new investment will heat up to 9 thousand suns but be aware, it can get toasty durring high CPU stressing programs. Overall great build, I reccomend looking at Jarrod's Tech review on youtube if you are still uncertain."}]},

I wasn't expecting much from a $500 laptop but just needed something to get me reconnected. Setup was a breeze, setting it to my preferences was simple, removing the (modest) bloatware from Acer was easy and I was pleasantly surprised at the quickness of the unit. The memory and drive appear to be easily and inexpensively upgradeable but it functions flawlessly right out of the box. I wasn't paying for or expecting gaming-quality graphics but the display renders internet and video perfectly. Those that find fault with this unit must be comparing it to others costing 2 to 3 times as much. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking a laptop to take care of their basic computing needs. Very nice product for the money. Well done, Acer. Update from 10 days later:  Been using it relentlessly and comparing it to my desktop, which had far more memory, storage and graphics capabilities, and I am honestly thrilled. I was thinking of using this as a bridge-unit until I could go back to a new desktop but am seriously rethinking that. The thing that really impresses me is the boot-time. This guy goes from powered down to browsing in about 30 seconds. Not sure if that's just the SSD or newer CPU but I am loving it. Pretty sure I'm going to start using this as my main and adding a docking station, keyboard/mouse (of course), monitor, a bit more memory and storage, and just rolling with it. Disclaimer: I am not a gamer and I understand this machine won't do complex graphics. Update 2: Just to see if it would work, I installed a $65 16GB memory card to bring the total RAM to 20GB, the maximum Acer allows for the unit (it comes with 8GB but you have to remove a 4GB card to upgrade). It worked flawlessly and it is now far zippy-er than my Dell. From what I've read, the extra memory allows it to run cooler and hopefully adds to its service life. Update 3 (I promise this is the last). Thrilled with this little budget-monkey. Restart time, 25-30 seconds. Startup from shut down (not sleep), 12-15 seconds including pin-entry time. Kicking it up to 20GB memory really helped. For anyone that wants to try this stunt (and possibly void the warranty) all it takes is a plastic spudger (google it) and a small Phillips head screwdriver to take the back of the laptop off. 16GB memory cards are readily available from Crucial and Memorystock, usually on Amazon. The video that gave me confidence to try it was on YouTube but it showed how to add a hard drive, not a memory card. Older Acers had a removable panel over the memory but on the  Acer Aspire 5 A515-54-51DJ, you have to take off the whole back. Don't even try it if you are confused about which end of a screwdriver to use or never read instructions. A final note about some of the drama-queen reviewers that complained that \"it gets so hot\" or \"the fan sounds like a 747 taking off\": Just because it's called a laptop doesn't mean you should use it on your lap covered with your fleece blanket blocking the air vents. Use mine on my desk and on the rare occasions that the fan kicks on under heavy use it makes a gentle whirring sound, barely noticeable. If it died tomorrow, I'd buy another. Loving it Update 4 (OK, I lied).  After upgrading the memory and performing every performance-enhancing trick I could find on the internet with Windows, apps, settings and everything else, I started testing my budget computer. The most comprehensive free test I found was from UserBenchMark and I was kinda proud of the results. The test results can vary depending on the state of the computer but here was my best test (the others were pretty close): \"Overall this PC is performing way above expectations (95th percentile). This means that out of 100 PCs with exactly the same components, 5 performed better. The overall PC percentile is the average of each of its individual components. This PC is likely operated by a technical master!\" Did you hear that? I'm a technical master!  All kidding aside, this $500 budget unit is working so far above my previous desktop that I'll never go back (sorry, Dell). I read that the average laptop only lasts 3-5 years before needing replacement. I'm OK with that and my next unit is definitely going to be a graphics-improved version of this machine, hopefully Acer.

I DARE you to tell me i'm wrong. I have an Acer aspire E15 and an acer aspire 5 (5504) and the fan noise combined from those two laptops are less than 1/8th the loudness of this new laptop. IT IS TERRIBLE. Think you can live with that? There's more: If you're a long time user of acer products you've become used to the 2nd function keys being assigned between the F3 to F9 keys and in blue. Thats GONE with this laptop. Here's the new configuration. F1 (previously f4) is the sleep function key, F2 (previously unassigned) is now airplane mode/wifi disable key, F3 and F4 (previously wifi and sleep respectively) are to adjust screen brightness, F8 (previously mute function key) has switched places with F9 now serving the keyboard backlight on/off function, F9 (previously keyboard backlighting function) is actually the mute function key. F10 and F11 (previously unassigned) are now the volume down and up function keys respectively. Just to add some additional frustration to the mix none of these keys are the second function anymore. So if you're used to hitting F5 to refresh browser windows or F3 to search now you'll need to hit the Fn Key first as the media functions take precedence in this new keyboard layout. This can actually be changed by rebooting and pressing F2 to enter the bios settings before windows loads. Even if you change the F1 - F12 keys back to their original hierarchic order the arrow keys are no longer the keys to access brightness or volume control but instead are music media keys. Good luck with that confusion. This new laptop basically is an all out attack on keyboard shortcut users even the Home key is now a point of frustration since they removed the dedicated home key and you're only left with the numlock access only home key that shares functionality with the number 7 key on the keypad. I also had to finish install necessary driver level software like the \"acer quick access application\" because as this was not installed there was no way to know if num lock or capslock was engaged as there is no LED indicating the status of these keys. Even if you Update the bios to the latest firmware version like I did it still won't solve the problem of the USB 3.0 ports having slower read/write speeds than a typical USB 2.0 port. Anyway At least THANK GOD on the plus side as a result of all that fan noise you do get ample cooling so the laptop does stay nice and cool..... HAHAHHAHAHAHAH PSYCH NOOOOOOOOOOOO no such luck my friend this laptop gets VERYYYYYY HOTTTTT in your lap and it is just pathetic that for all the fan noise you have to deal with it can't even keep the laptop at a comfortable temp while sitting there idle without a single thing going on. The charger is also not the regular acer charger so if you have other acer laptops that can share chargers interchangeably this one will not work with them.  BTW this is all within the first half hr of use. Imagine what I'll discover by this time tomorrow. Seriously guys and gals if you're a long time acer product user and you've become accustomed to any level of consistency across their products just forget it with this laptop. I currently use the A515-51G-5504 aspire 5 for productivity and while you may think that the only difference between the two is that one has a dedicated graphics card and the other does not TRUST ME those two laptops are like NIGHT AND DAY different when it comes to speed, noise levels, and general build quality.

I was originally reluctant to buy an Acer as I was not very sure about the quality, was concerned about another review that mentioned the fan was very loud, and was not sure I could live with a SSD of 256 only. Here are my initial impressions: 1 Speed. It is a JOY to power up this computer. In fact, I shut it down and then back up just to enjoy how fast it is to power up. I was always amazed by how the Chromebook my son gets from his middle school was so much faster than my Satellite (or even the HP I have at work) was to power up. I guess it all pretty much boiled down to the SSD vs. the HDD hard drive. If you are debating whether it makes a difference, I can grantee you it makes a world of difference. This computer is up and running in seconds. I used to DREAD doing anything in my 3 year old Satellite. No more. It is also very fast to write to the SSD if you are downloading large files. Fast fast fast. 2 Storage. I have a ton of pictures and videos and they won't all fit in this 256GB SSD, but is it VERY easy to solve that. This computer comes with an HDD harness and cable to add an internal HDD (max width is 7mm) and there are Acer videos on  how to do it. I almost did it in about 15 minutes, but was unsuccessful only because I tried to use the 1TB HDD from my Satellite not realizing the width was 9.5mm until I tried to close the case back up. You can buy a compatible 1TB HDD for about $50. You can also add an external HDD of 2TB in capacity for about $60. With either of these solutions you get a really fast computer with enough storage. 3 Current Generation Processor (Intel Core 5 8th generation). You can check the benchmarks on how fast it is. For my General Family Laptop purposes it fits the bill just fine. 4 Build quality. This laptop feels very sold and I love the lighten keys that the Satellite did not have. 5 Really good overall value. I paid about $500 for this laptop, and if you factor an extra $50 to $60 for extra storage you are at a sub $600 setup with newest (as of July 2019) Intel Core 5, 256GB SSD, great build quality, good monitor, etc. I think it is a great deal.

Setup is very simple, even with the minimal amount of manuals and documentation you find in the box. It's very literally a plug and play experience.

When multiple apps are running, it can experience slowdown, but typically this has only happened with me while I'm running very intense programs - playing or converting media while surfing the web and typing something.  Again, this is something that I doubt most users of the device will notice, but if you are a power user, it makes sense to upgrade from this model. The other thing to call out is the speakers - they are outstanding.  Loud, clear sound, and easy controls make this a standout feature that most laptops don't have. The only major downside for me is that there is only the 256GB SSD, without any traditional hard drive for data storage.  It's not that there are not options, from cloud storage to removable drives, but it is kind of an inconvenience for those who have large data libraries they'd like to access on the go.  The device does come with a kit to upgrade the drive kit, but few users, myself included, will likely crack this open and give it a go. Overall, this is a classy piece of equipment that belies it's low price, and that makes it a great buy in my opinion.  You wouldn't think from taking a look at the construction or the general performance that this is a budget priced laptop.

Initial set up was simple (though, because it is Windows 10, I am reminded why I HATE CORTANA!!!!) And everything is plug-n-play. Connect speakers, headphones, a mouse, or whatever sort of peripheral you need with no real problems.  As far as out-of-the-box ease and reliability, it is perfectly fine. People want laptops for three functions: work software, watching media, or gaming. Most laptops are built to do one of these functions well, at the expense of the other functions. It you are looking for a solid, reliable work laptop to handle documents, spreadsheets, and most business related software, this will work effectively. Unfortunately, there are plenty of lower priced laptops that will work just as effectively. In fact, if you are looking for a productivity laptop, you are probably looking for something with a touchscreen, which this unit does not have. This laptop can handle multiple spreadsheets open simultaneously while surfing the internet and handling email and messaging. But pretty much any decent laptop can do that these days for half what this one costs. If you are looking for something to watch videos and other media, the HD display is truly gorgeous. It really does have exceptional crispness. But then you need to ask yourself if watching those cat videos on Youtube or the latest Netflix series is actually worth over $800 to you, or will you get comparable results with a notebook or less expensive laptop. I personally am not the type of person who thinks spending that kind of money just to watch media on a laptop is a worthwhile investment. But if that is your thing, then this might be what you want. Lastly, gaming. This laptop is pretty useless for most modern gaming. It can run low-power games like Minecraft and older titles like Fallout 3 (note: Fallout 3 does not organically run on Windows 10. So there are a lot of workarounds and hacks you will need to do to get the game to work. But it can be done. It will run the MMO Neverwinter and looks good. It can run Star Wars the Old Republic on low settings. But it doesn't run much else. Forget running MMOs like Elder Scrolls Online or even games that are only a couple years old (Witcher 3 or Fall Out 4 simply won't run at all even on the lowest settings. The laptop doesn't meet the minimum requirements). I'm giving the laptop 4 stars because it has a great display and solid functionality. But that is based purely on the mechanics of the unit, not the usability of it. The problem is, for a gaming laptop, it is poor. And for a work or media laptop, there are comparable laptops that are just as good and almost half the price. Nothing about this laptop justifies the current price tag of over $800.

Got the Laptop swiftly like Amazon knows to deliver and opened up the box. So here are my impressions after 3 days of use (I will update my review after several weeks): Build quality&design: Acer design is pleasant, Business oriented but somewhat dull. The build seems ok, sturdy enough for general use but I would be careful not to drop the thing. the size is significantly bigger then my 14inch dell, so consider buying a protection sleeve for it, But for a 15.6inch laptop it's pretty light, so good for travel. Screen: The IPS screens delivers nice display, nice colors and sharpness. the brightness is more then enough for using during daytime, but not in direct sunlight or very sun lit rooms. The bezels are thin, but the screen is warping if you move it with your hands. All in all a nice HD display, nothing fancy. Touch&keyboard The touch pad is in a good size, ok accuracy but not needle precision. The multi fingers gestures works great. The keyboard is Chiclets style, has nice feedback and feel. But... NO indicator for CapsLock NO indicator for NumLock NO indicator for touchpad lock And the Home, End, PG Up, PG Down are on the NumPad so If you use them, it will be annoying to turn the NumLock off every time. The Backlight keyboard is great, But... It turns off automatically after 8 seconds and you can't change this setting. Why? only Acer knows the answer for that. Also, when you plugin the Laptop to the electric cable, the Small and almost invisible little blue led charging light indicator is located on the right side (the opposite side from the plug hole) and there is NO on screen indicator for it. What?! this is plain stupid. The wrist space on the keyboard is very convenient. Performance: Well, in this area no complaints so far. I5 8th gen is speedy and responsive. the Nvme drive is great and the 8G ram is enough for general use. All in All I gave it 4 stars, because for 500$ or so, it's pretty good deal, but the small and annoying things made it go down in rating.

It's quite fast and responds well enough, though I don't think I'm going to try any heavy AAA gaming on the MX250. Only cons are that I'm not a big fan of 4GB of the ram being soldered in permanently (though being a slim model I get get why,) and I don't think Acer enabled Adaptix power management on this so you're stuck at 15w for the CPU.

Some very high end, some low end. I'm currently moving and needed a laptop for motels/hotels that could allow me to work easily but not spend a lot for something I'll likely wind up giving to my kids after I'm done. This laptop's i5 processor is zippy compared to other i5s I've had. Having SSD out of the box combined with that makes a lot almost instant. I'm used to coding on linux without the overhead of Windows based IDEs but even Microsoft Visual Studio on here is decently fast. Some people have complained about the backlight on the keyboard going out after 30 seconds or whatever (I haven't timed it.) Do you want your battery dying fast? I don't. Really it's as simple as pressing any button for it to turn back on. In the very bottom-left is the control (ctrl) key which I just tap first so I'm not accidentally entering a wrong letter or such and boom the backlight is back on and stays on as you type. Another reviewer said it's not suitable for the dark but fact is that if their backlight was staying off they couldn't be typing much. On the note of the keyboard, it's really nice having a separate number pad on the laptop. A lot are missing this nowadays. Another reviewer complained about the F1-F12 keys defaulting to their functions instead of F buttons and having to use the Fn key. Well, just keep tapping F2 RIGHT after you hit the power button and before Windows loads to enter the BIOS settings. You can switch it to default to F1-F12 and hold the Fn key for the functions instead. Memory is 8GB upgradable to 20GB. I haven't bothered yet. I powerhouse on my desktops but haven't needed more on here yet. Even while running visual studio and installing multiple programs while using chrome and firefox I barely surpassed 4GB. Truth is I've never needed more than 8GB unless I was gaming even though the other computers have a minimum of 16. People are nitpicking at this laptop. It's a 500 dollar laptop. If you need more power/etc for your money, buy a desktop but then you also have to pay for a monitor or get a computer with a monitor in exchange for lower specs. I've been building computers and programming for 20 years now as well as gaming. I give this a thumbs up. Just don't expect to play any fancy games on it but truth is even the intel graphics has 4GB of GPU memory which is plenty for a lot of games combined with it's speed unless for some reason you need super high def graphics. Someone else mentioned RS3 on here. I've played it on lower computers. It's one of the benchmarks I use. I only play it with my wife for something to do together so haven't tested it on here as of now but it should definitely run without an issue. Also the WIFI chip/card (haven't looked) gets faster speeds than my tablet or phone. I'm using a mobile hotspot which is speed limited and get at least 4mbps on it which about maxes it. I'd safely assume normal WIFI would be much faster. I haven't heard the fan once even compiling a lot of code but I keep it on flat and hard surfaces. This is another complaint people have brought up... Know what you're buying when you buy. The vent is on the bottom as with other laptops I've purchased. Just don't block it and you won't have a problem. It's a fairly big vent area compared to having one on the side which actually is beneficial to cooling if you don't block it."}, {"name": "Mark R.

Decent size SSD (easily upgradeable to 1TB if you want/need), and comes with an extra SSD caddy, connector and spare screws to add a second storage drive.  High speed CPU/SSD/motherboard bus/interface (PCIe/NVMe).  Biometric security/ID options.  Nicely backlit keypad.  Decent number of input options.  The build is a little on the flimsy/plasticky side (only the top shell is aluminum, which is exactly where you want it BTW \u2026 to protect the most costly single part in the whole appliance:  the screen), but heck, that's \"entry level\" ... my laptop is at my workstation/desk most of the time, so that's no problem for me.  All my prior, trusty Toshiba Satellites had no aluminum on the outer case at all. This thing is sleek, lightweight, fast and very easy to set up/use.  Acer has taken all the most attractive advances in laptop tech from the past 5-10 years and figured out a way to streamline and squeeze them into a really nice entry level machine at a VERY competitive price.  The only thing I might grouse about on this laptop is the bare minimum 8GB RAM they put in it (the removable/replaceable part is only 4GB), but that can be upgraded to 20GB for around $60 if you need it. I've been using laptops as my primary work station for more than 20 years now, and every time I replace one, I marvel at how far they've come by the time I upgrade.  No exception to that rule here ... couldn't be happier with what I got for the buck in this one.  Only time will tell how it holds up.  Thanks Acer ... nice work, and thanks to Amazon and \"Prime Day\" for making my choice/purchase even easier. [P.S. to original review:  I had an unused spare HDD that I bought for my previous laptop a long time ago before converting it to SSD, and thought I might as well use it for extra storage space in this laptop.  It installed/worked fine with the caddy, connector and screws supplied by Acer, but I found that once I'd put the HDD in, the bottom cover was noticeably bulged over the HDD, and the edge closest to it wouldn't fully seat/seal, in turn, making the rest points on the bottom uneven/wobbly.  In short, Acer's case design is a little too thin for proper fit of an HDD in the internal secondary drive bay.  I ended up getting a new 2.5\" SSD which fit just fine in the secondary bay, but I SHOULD also be able to put an HDD in there and can't, that is, if I don't want a bulge and uneven/wobbly rest points on the bottom of my new laptop.  But, since re-purposing of my old HDD was an afterthought with no bearing on my original purchase decision, and everyone knows that laptop HDDs are rapidly going the way of the dodo anyway, this issue falls into the category of, e.g., \"minor annoyance.\"]"}, {"name": "Andrew Harman", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2019", "title": "DO NOT BUY - Screen Died After 6 Weeks", "review_text": "DO NOT BUY Purchased product via Amazon 6 weeks ago and at first it worked fine.

It's well made, nicely spec'd, and performs well. The Acer is made primarily from plastic with an aluminum cover on the top of the case.  The materials used feel robust, are nicely finished, and everything is well assembled.  Overall it feels like a quality laptop.  The 15\" screen keeps it from being truly small, but it's thin and light enough to travel easily.  It's thicker than my circa 2015 15\" MacBook Pro, but it's lighter.  Included with the Acer is a power cord that has a AC/DC converter brick attached.  The power cord requires a grounded outlet. The laptop's screen opens and closes smoothly, stays in position well, and is held closed magnetically.  The screen pivots a full 180 degrees.  The screen is bright, sharp, colorful, and has a wide viewing angle.  It performs well editing photos and watching videos.  It's bright enough to use in a sunlight room but direct sunlight washes out the screen.  It's not as bright or sharp as the MacBook Pro's screen, but it also costs a lot less. The speakers are placed on the bottom front edge of the laptop.  The placement helps them reflect sound when the laptop is placed on a hard surface, but placing it on a lap or bed muffles the sound.  The speakers have decent sound quality but don't get particularly loud. The keyboard is back-lit and has large and satisfying to use keys.  I appreciate the numeric keypad.  The track pad is generously sized and works well. The selection of ports is robust and includes 3 USB type A ports, 1 USB type C port, an Ethernet port, a headphone jack, and an HDMI port.  The only thing missing is an SD card slot. In use the Acer has robust performance.  It can more than handle word processing, spreadsheets, e-mail, and web surfing.  It's also more than capable of streaming HD videos and editing photos in Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop.  It's not as quick as my MacBook Pro in Lightroom but it's not far behind and is a satisfying experience.  At one point I had an HD video streaming, a web browser open, and Lightroom running in the background simultaneously and the Acer was able to keep up.  It powers on quickly and is ready to go in less than a minute. It stays pretty cool while using it but you should be careful to not completely block the large grille on the bottom.  Battery life is great.  For just surfing the web you can easily get 7-8 hours out of a charge.  Video streaming and photo editing will give you about 3-4.

The battery life on this thing is also completely miserable."}, {"name": "Devan Winters", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2020", "title": "Perfect in Every Way BUT One Major Flaw", "review_text": "I love nearly everything about this laptop but would have returned it in a heartbeat had I realized one significant flaw in time.  Sadly I did not open the box for several weeks and now I am stuck with it.  Shame on me. The flaw in question may seem minor, but it becomes so aggravating that even the most mellow person would want to throw it out a window.  The flaw?  The trackpad. Because the trackpad is one complete unit without a defined left or right 'mouse button', a plethora of issues can occur.  MOST annoying is that the slightest touch will move the cursor to another part of a sentence being typed - and it happens frequently.  Quickly and correctly typing notes or documents is not an option because of this.  Further, without a defined button for left and right, you can only be certain you are hitting the right key by going to the furthest left or right corner of the keypad.  It's hard to be efficient when you have to do this. It may not sound like much, but when your work includes lots of typing and use of the left and right mouse buttons, it can be infuriating. The computer itself is otherwise amazing - so I cannot fathom why they would include such a frustrating component to ruin the whole experience.  It's truly a deal-breaker for me.  I recommend finding a similar quality computer but make sure it has a defined left and right key at the bottom of the mouse pad and save yourself the frustration I am dealing with using this computer for both work and personal use 60+ hours a week."}, {"name": "Cong Li", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2019", "title": "Smooth and lightweight", "review_text": "Super nice laptop!

It's lightweight, but still has a graphics card that can handle some casual games. I can run Rocket League at high quality with all the effects at 60fps. Google NVIDIA MX250 and you can find a list of playable games. The most important reason I chose this laptop is that it's lightweight and yet there is a passable graphics card. I'm not a heavy gamer (or a gamer at all in that regard) so this laptop fits my needs perfectly. I do think that if you have high demands for gaming, you should probably invest in some other model.

Using VLC it can play three HD videos at once with no issues, only using about 1/2 the CPU power. Exporting edited videos with VideoPad (the free editor) takes about as long as my 5th gen i7 system did - I was hoping for faster, but it's not bad. Software development is great. It has a nice display -  I can get a lot of code on the display with the small text getting fuzzy. I added a 16GB memory card for a total of 20 GB - with this I can run multiple memory hogging IDE tools and never get close to the memory limits. The upgrade was easy to perform. The SSD lets my compiles scream along as fast as any machine I've ever used (disk IO is usually the bottleneck for code development, the SSD fixes this if I keep my code on the C: drive.) . The SSD  waaaaay too small to use this as a media machine is you don't add more space. Fortunately ACER provides  a  7mm high slot for an additional disk, including the mounting bracket, cable and screws. This was a really nice touch for us techies! I installed a 1TB hard disk for about $40, ( which shows up as a \"D\" drive) and keep all my videos out there. The small \"C:\" SSD is only about have full, even after loading all my favorite development software out there. I was going to upgrade it to a 1TB SSD, but I may just not bother - the second drive takes the space pressure off. My first unit arrived with battery issues, but they sent me a replacement without even waiting for me to return the defective one, so I'll not take off any stars for that.  I might have also taken off a star for the small SSD, but their considerate provision for adding the second drive, especially including the cables and bracket, earns them back the star.

I'm spoiled, and never going to a plain one again :-)  - Battery life is great (4-5 hours), even with my screen turned up very bright, hard CPU use, and the extra drive. - I hate windows 10 for many reasons, but following online advice I've been able to beat it into submission. - The included Norton AV software is obnoxious, but can be easily uninstalled (which I did). AVG isn't much better, but at least its free. - It's is indeed light and thin, and small for a 15.6\" screen due to the narrow bezel. Very nice form factor! - I runs cool.

There is no option to make it stay on.  This laptop is not suitable for anyone who needs to use it in a dark environment. Performance - other than the annoying design decision above, this is a great laptop for its price.  Windows 10 boots in seconds and overall the laptop feels snappy. 1920x1080 Full HD IPS display - the screen has very minimal IPS light bleed so black level is actually quite decent.  But the sRGB coverage is only at 58% (per DisplayCAL calibration) so don't expect pictures to look terrific.  Again think about the price of this laptop and the screen is OK.  If you need a screen with full sRGB (or wide color gamut P3 like newer Macbooks) coverage, you will have to pay much more. Wifi speed is a bit disappointing.  My Mid 2015 Macbook Pro has about twice the download/upload speed.  This is based on the 5GHz band and the AP is an Apple Airport Extreme, so could this be a compatibility issue?  I have Verizon FiOS 1Gbs Internet connectivity. Connectivity - great onboard connectivity options with 2 x USB 3.1, 1 x USB-C, 1 x USB 2.0, 1 x HDMI, 1 x Ethernet.  I can only get the onboard HDMI 2.0 port to reach 4K@30Hz not 60Hz.  This is tested with an LG 55\" E7 OLED and a 49SM8600PUA Nano 8 Series 49\" TV.  Enabling/Disabling HDMI Deep Color option on the TV makes no difference.  Changing HDMI input to PC mode on the TVs also makes no difference. Battery Life - I can't comment on the battery life as I tend to plug in the AC adaptor.  I would leave the battery at 80% or lower if I know I won't need to use the laptop for a while.

Overall, this laptop should be decent enough for apps, editing videos, etc. Just beware the battery life. Also, you may want to update the BIOS. You can do that on Acer's support page where you can find the drivers and BIOS to update. This may solve some fan issues. Also, for Linux users, Ubuntu 19.04 is the distribution that seems to work with this laptop. You'll have to switch off secure boot and turn on ACHI.

I think it is a great product for its price, that offers a discrete GPU that will outperform any Intel iGPU on the market, and it does so in a reasonable chassis. Unfortunately to offer such a low price for this laptop their support is pretty lackluster, and the quality control is not very good.  My laptop came with a defective memory unit, the memory that is soldered onto the motherboard to be specific. It took me a while to notice (too long to return) because the user-replaceable memory stick was swapped out for an 8gb one.  The laptop has 2 memory DIMM slots, both should be 4gb giving you a total of 8gb.  This is why the maximum amount of ram that you can upgrade in this is 20gb (16gb come from the stick you can change, the other 4gb is the nonreplaceable memory soldered onto the motherboard).  Unfortunately, the only way to fix this is to replace the entire motherboard. None of the customer support knew what I was talking about when I would explain that the memory soldered to the motherboard is defective.  They would just ask, \"Did it come with 8gb, does it turn on, etc\u201d This means that my computer doesn't have dual-channel memory, which hurts processor performance and memory performance.  It also means that I will always have 4gb less ram than what I should have.  If I install a 16gb stick I should have 20gb of total memory, but I will only have 16gb.  At one point I was even told that some models come with extra memory soldered to the motherboard and some models don't, which is just not true.  All these laptops (A515-54G-5928) have 4gb soldered onto the motherboard and Acer has publicly said so,  \"There is one slot that supports up to 16GB for max total of 20GB memory.\" Eventually, I was able to send my laptop in for repair.  I typed out a letter detailing the problem and how I know that the memory on the motherboard is defective, just in case there was a miscommunication somewhere.  I also sent the laptop in with the 8gb stick that was incorrectly supplied with the laptop. (it should be 4gb so that total memory is 8gb.  An 8gb stick should give a total of 12gb of memory) The tech that 'repaired' my laptop turned it on, saw that there was 8gb of total ram, and sent it back to me saying there were no issues found. Now I have another repair case to send the laptop in, postage is covered this time but only by FedEx.  I live in a small city, attending university, and have no car.  The nearest FedEx location is literally in another state.  So every time I ship this laptop back to them it will cost me about $30.  This means I am already down about $60 for a repair covered under warranty if I ship this back again.  They have already shown that they are not thorough with the repair, and I do not know how many more times it is going to take for them to finally replace the motherboard.  Every time they do not repair the laptop I will lose money, 30,60,90,120 etc.  I wonder how much it will cost to fix this. The entire time this is going on, I am in the middle of my engineering degree and I need a laptop for school.  Acer has put me into a very difficult situation, and I will no longer be recommending them.

Here is what you need to know. Slim and light build: People are here complaining about the plastic chassis and aluminum screen cover without realizing that this form factor is what keeps the laptop at under 2kg (under 4lbs). Cheapest laptop with an IPS display = Full 180 degree viewing angle with zero color shifting. Cheapest portable GPU = can play low requirement games like League of Legends at 1080p 60FPS easily and can play most modern games if downscaled to 720p Long lasting battery life = 8-10h battery life with light internet browsing. 6-7 hours of video playback. 4-5 hours of intensive gaming. Thermal efficiency = The laptop runs cool when the GPU not engaged.  When GPU and CPU are running at max, the fan is a little loud and the fan exhaust will heat up but it is unnoticeable on the keyboard. The downsides: The thin form factor combined with a long lasting battery and thermal efficiency comes at a cost.  While fine in dark environments, the screen is not as bright in direct sunlight (low wattage).  The CPU turbo-boosts to 3.4ghz for 10 seconds, and will then downclock to maintain temp and battery life.  The CPU may downclock even more when the GPU is engaged for long periods of time, again to maintain temperature and battery life. What this means is that the i5 version is more cost efficient than the i7 version as this laptop will almost never fully utilize it's CPU when running on max loads.  In short bursts, the difference between i5 and i7 is not noticeable.  The i7 version will only benefit those who are using high intensity loads in short bursts, like photo editing software like Photoshop, rendering programs like AutoCad, or statistical engines like SAS.

The screen resolution is crisp and amazing quality when playing 4k videos on YouTube or just general browsing on the internet. The speakers are located at the bottom of the laptop towards the front so a pretty weird place making the speaker quality not so great. I didn't get this laptop for audio so it's not an issue for me, but probably a good idea to hook up external speakers up for this laptop if you want better audio quality. There is a backlit keyboard that does stay on only for 30 seconds and then will turn off if you are not using the keyboard, BUT they came out with a Bios update within the last month or so where you can change that setting in the Bios menu to have the backlit keyboard on all the time. A quick search online for that will lead you to an article from Acer giving step by step instructions on how to do that. Several people talked about a fan noise issue. 99% of the time I don't hear the fan at all and 99% of the time it's dead quiet. Only when I updated the laptop (drivers, software, etc) did I hear a fan noise or when rendering a video through Premiere Pro. When I am browsing the internet watching YouTube or checking social media, I do not hear the fan. This is also a good reminder to immediately update all the drivers when you first get the laptop as well going into Settings, Update and Security and install settings there as several drivers had to be updated and several items were updated in the Update and Security section. Another issue I saw were people saying the couldn't connect to their wifi or the laptop kept disconnecting from the wifi. So far I had no issue with that and could have been an issue with their modem/router. It is indeed tricky to open the laptop if you close it, but not a deal breaker for me and shouldn't be for anyone. Since this laptop came with a SSD, I can turn the laptop on, log in and be at the home screen in 10 seconds flat which is amazing if you need to quickly jump on the computer. Adobe products (Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere Pro) also open up really fast and had no issue editing and rendering 4k video along with 1080p video in Premiere Pro. This laptop will be replacing a Lenovo laptop that I bought in 2014 where it is an i7, has 8gb ram and a 2gb NVIDIA graphics card. So far, this Acer laptop has blown the Lenovo laptop away in regards to speed, screen resolution (both being Full HD screens) and being able to quickly render 1080p and 4k video along with having no issues watching 4k videos on YouTube.

After two and a half weeks, these are my thoughts: Speed: The primary reason I wanted to update my laptop from a nearly 6-yr old HP Pavilion was to get better speed. This laptop delivers the goods. With an 8th generation i5-8265u, 8GB of RAM (expandable to 20GB max), and a 256GB PCIe-NVMe SSD, it is only the Intel UHD 620 graphics that holds it back. From completely off (not sleeping), to booted and signed in, with a functional desktop, ready to respond, takes 12 seconds. The SSD gets most of the credit, though the fingerprint reader speeds sign in significantly (it doesn't work every time). Apps open quickly, and web pages load promptly. More importantly, it feels fast. On User Bench, it tests out as only a Surfboard as a gaming platform, and a Sailboat as a workstation (no big surprises based on the graphics and amount of RAM), but it is a Battlecruiser as a desktop. For everyday computing, this rig is a member of the Brute Squad. So, on speed, it earns a solid check mark. Screen: Excellent. It is bright, colors are nicely saturated, and, as expected these days, no dead pixels. At typical working distance, it is a retina screen, with not a pixel in sight. Thanks to the IPS technology, the wide viewing angle without the \u201cphotographic negative\u201d effect is a solid plus. How many nits, and what percent of the color gamut can it display? Don't know, don't care. It easily passes the \u201ceye test.\u201d So the screen warrants a solid check mark. Of note, this is NOT a touchscreen. Keyboard: The other reason I wanted to upgrade was to have a back-lit keyboard. It was a MUST-have, and I will not purchase another laptop, or any other keyboard that is not back-lit. Are you listening out there, all you laptop manufacturers? I like the size of, and the feel of the keys. It is a fairly quiet keyboard. The back light does turn off after 30 seconds of no input, in order to conserve battery. Some have criticized this feature. If you continue input, it does not turn off. If it turns off, it comes back on by depressing any key. And the back light is not just around the edges of each key, but each character is is illuminated as well, so you can really see what you are doing. The only negative is that the Home, End, PgUp, and PgDn keys share double duty with 4 keys of the numeric keypad, and you have to turn NumLock on and off to use them. Also, the NumLock and the hated CapsLock key do not have indicator lights to tell you if the are on or off. Both of these are significant, though not fatal flaws, in my opinion. So on the keyboard - check. WiFi: It works. No fuss, no muss. Connects easily, and it is fast. On Speedtest by Ookla, it produces a download speed of 207mbps, and an upload speed of 116mbps, over a background of a nominal internet connection speed of 300mbps. Of course, your results will vary. WiFi \u2013 check. Form Factor: This is a 15.6\u201d screen, and it weighs ~4lbs. It is comfortable to use. The track pad is fairly large, and works well, though I have yet to learn all the gestures that are available. I like it. Fan Noise: This has been an issue of criticism in some reviews of Aspire 5's. I would disagree. Most of the time, fan noise is minimal or absent. Occasionally, if the CPU is pushed harder, fan noise does become audible. However, it tends to be short-lived, e.g., <30 seconds. So I don't regard it as much of an issue. Battery Life: I mostly use my laptop plugged in, so battery life is not a major issue for me. However, the estimate of 5hrs of battery life on average seems reasonable, based on some experience on battery power. The claim of 9.5 hrs maximum seems a bit of a stretch, but not necessarily impossible if you maximize power saving. Adding a 2nd SSD: With only 256GB on the SSD, a 2nd hard drive of some sort seems mandatory. These days, given the prices of SSD's, there is little excuse for installing a traditional HDD. I added a 1TB Crucial SSD, at a very reasonable price, and the upgrade was relatively easy (the hardest part was prying the back off after removing the 11 screws), aided by a very helpful Acer YouTube video that walks you through the process. Also, the laptop comes with the needed bracket, cable and connector, and all the screws to add the SSD. So, adding the 2nd SSD, which was a MUST-have, was painless. Good one, Acer! In Sum: For <$500 (at the Black Friday prices for the laptop and SSD), I have an awesome laptop, built for general everyday computing tasks. In my book, this is an outstanding value. 5-month update: After 5 months with this laptop, I have only come to appreciate it even more. It remains very fast, everything works, the screen and the keyboard are great (excepting the few keyboard omissions noted above), battery life is more than acceptable. Best laptop I have ever owned, by a lot!

I had to get a replacement as I received a similar model but not the one i ordered (A515-54G-73WC). I could see how most people wouldn't think twice about this but its important to check. The box i got had the correct model number but the laptop did not. That being said, this laptop didn't end up working out for me. I am definitely a power user, and the specs of this laptop are great. I upgraded it with a 16gb module maxing it out at 20GB and I replaced the M.2 SSD that came with it, with a 1TB 970 Pro. I didn't have any issues with the specs or performance. It was fantastic at this price point. I did have issues though with the overall quality of the device as well as what I believe were BIOS issues with using a different hard drive than what came with it. I couldn't get the laptop to properly go into standby or hibernation mode without some combination of BSOD or being told the hard drive couldn't be found etc. This wasn't going to work for me as i needed to use the fast 970 PRO. Maybe Acer will update the BIOS and that will help in the future. This may not be an issue for you, especially if you don't re-image the laptop or put in a different hard drive.

At this point it said it had 19m remaining. Do keep in mind this was a brand new battery so this should improve. I also noticed that it seemed to run the fans pretty loud.. especially when i first got it. It seemed to die down after having it for a week, but it still seemed to be louder than what i would expect. Pros: Inexpensive Awesome specs for the price Easy to open the case to replace the memory module or hard drive. I actually kind of liked the color, but some would say it doesn't have the \"premium\" look Cons: Possible BIOS issue with using different hard drives. Included SSD is a slow SSD (some may not even notice this) Plastic body Body sometimes would \"creek\" when it flexed (it was minor.. but an artifact of the plastic build) I only had one for a bit over a week with my normal usage, and it already started to \"wear\" in the palm area below the keyboard. Body seemed to pick up oils easily. Just needs more cleaning. The lid needs a bit more of a touch to open as it doesn't have a notch like some laptops do. I found it had a small \"ridge\" that would usually work to get it to open, but it wasn't as easy as it could have been. In order to trigger the power button to turn off or hibernate, you have to hold it for 3ish seconds. The back lit keyboard wouldn't turn on when swiping the touchpad, only when pressing a key. I know I had a lot of negatives here and the laptop didn't end up working for me.. but I feel like it has its place. If your looking for a budget laptop with excellent specs, but can deal with some of the nuances of a less expensive build then this is for you. You wont find something similar and aesthetically pleasing without spending at least $3-400 more.

They propose it is to  \"Enhance the users experience\" but in reality they are at best a nuisance and some are malicious usage trackers.. In the past these were relatively easy for technically literate users to eliminate. Now they have become much more sophisticated and devious and it took me about 5-6 hours to \"disinfect\" this ACER 5 slim machine. I use my laptop for serious work and cannot have tracking software of any kind so I am very careful what I load on my machines. I do not use Facebook, Twitter, Skype or even the Google search engine because of their  \"behind-the-screens\" mischief. SO I thought I have every thing cleared off except the pre-installed Firefox browser (my browser of choice). I was setting this machine up for my wife and upon boot-up the desktop and functionality has to \"look\" just like the old machine else she is not \"happy\" with the change. Even to the point of having the exactly same Firefox tabs open in the new machine as was open in the old machine. So after everything was prepared and all the other software installed I moved her old Firefox \"profile\" to the new machine and turned it over to her. After about 5-10 minutes Firefox locked up and would not exit. Even \"task manager\" could not clear the fault. I was able to force a \"restart\" but then Firefox would not load at all. At this point I have about 20 hours of time in this project. If I was doing this for a customer that would be about $1000 dollars for a $500 dollar computer. In the end and MANY hours of work later, after doing aWindows restore to the initial state of the machine and removing all the \"crapware\" again I used control panel to uninstall Firefox and deleted all its related folders including those in the hidden c:/user/username/%APPDATA% and c:/user/Public/downloads folder (delete everything there). I then downloaded Firefox from their website and set everything up again. So far all looks good but she uses Facebook so her footprints are being collected. I never use her computer for my work so that's OK. In the near future I will need a new machine and am not looking forward to having to set it up. Next time I will buy a Microsoft Surface Tablet I hear they have very little useless software preinstalled. This is not just an ACER problem HP is probably the worst. It seems everyone is trying to copy the Facebook model to collect as much user data as they can as there is a HUGE market for this data, The problem is once they have it it is lucrative for \"hackers\" to harvest it and they sell for nefarious purposes.

Fortunately, using a Chromebook for a year taught me to utilize platforms and cloud storage for nearly everything, so hard drive space is not a concern for me. Also, I am not a \"gamer\" per se, so I don't need the gaming stuff (fast processors, awesome graphics processing cards, whatever). I use this primarily for writing, editing, photography editing, online research, etc. I also use it for watching movies/TV shows (whether streaming or downloaded), accessing large JPG files, and sometimes playing games that don't involve being chased or shooting anyone(thing) haha PROS: * This computer is very, very fast for what I need -- I am a professional screenwriter, writer/editor, and photographer, so I use it to do writing and photography editing. * I can have 20 tabs open on Google while simultaneously using Word for multiple-document editing, screenwriting software, AND downloading updates. Even on 2G wi-fi, the speed never even hiccups. * The graphics are AMAZING and the screen size is awesome. Love the backlit keyboard, and the ability to use night settings to cut down on blue light emissions so I (might) go to sleep on time! * For the money, this is a great laptop for those who aren't \"serious gamers\" -- although I have used it for movies, TV shows, streaming live, etc. and it is phenomenal. I don't do any gaming that requires fast processing, so this doesn't matter to me at all. * Downloading movies, TV shows, large documents, bulky JPG files, everything has gone very quickly and smoothly. Even using my screenwriting software hasn't caused any problems at all, regardless of how much I do all at once (I multi-task a LOT). I currently have 17 tabs open on Google Chrome, Word, and my system is updating. No issues! * Works great with portable hard drives, wireless headphones, wired earbuds, phone integration (cell phone synced with laptop for messaging while working), and the power cord actually was identical to my previous Chromebook! * Lightweight, large screen, nice-sized keyboard (includes the numerical pad) and a lot of features I still haven't gotten to explore! CONS: * The battery dies rather quickly, when used for movie/TV show viewing (about 4 hours from full charge). When used for writing/editing and online work (only) it lasts closer to 7 hours. * Sometimes, the touchpad will just stop working, altogether. However, I use a wireless mouse so this doesn't bother me very much. If you use the touchpad exclusively, this will be a MAJOR issue. * If you are used to having big, fat hard drive space -- well, that's just silly (use the cloud, people!!) -- then you will not like the \"smaller\" amount of hard drive space on this laptop.

Is NOT Reliable (REVISED)", "review_text": "****ORIGINAL**** I love this computer.  I have purchased so many other computers that were no good and ended up giving them away.  This is the first Acer computer I have ever purchased and was impressed with the speed.  The boot-up time is like one second.  I wondered if I left it on overnight, but I didn't.  It's just fast on its own. Occasionally I had problems with the fingerprint reader being a little fussy and made me have to use the PIN until I figured out it works better if I don't swipe my finger and just tap from above.  Deleting and redoing it fixed the problem. I purchased this mainly because I wanted the fingerprint reader and hate passwords.  I am very security conscious, and all new computers should be required to have the fingerprint reader otherwise I won't buy them. Less hard drive space is no problem for me since I mostly use external drives and cloud storage.  I do not keep a lot of personal data on the 256GB SSD drive very long for security reasons.  I mostly use this computer for online, paying bills, and some graphics software.  Now I'm starting to use it more for other software because it is a fast computer even for an i5.  I'm looking to order another Acer and stop buying the brand I've been using for years.  Even after installing large graphics programs I still have about half the space left. I highly recommend this laptop if you want something fast.  I have been using an older version of a 3D program (Poser), and when I found out it was running a little too slow, I moved the content files from the hard drive to an external drive with my other extensive content.  Those files that are normally required to live on the hard drive work much better on an external drive with other content.  There was a major improvement with opening files and many of mine are several hundred GB's in size.  If this laptop can handle opening those files there may be some luck with graphic games.  I haven't tried that yet and probably won't since I don't know if it will work putting Steam games on an external drive and those files are large. This Acer laptop came with a bracket for having another drive installed, but I doubt I'll bother.  It said in instructions to have it done professionally.  My luck with professionals where I live hasn't been good so I'm satisfied just using external drives and whatever space is left on the SSD drive. REVISION: About a month after purchasing it, I had two Blue Screen errors the same day telling me I should reset it.  I thought it could be attributed to a bad Windows 10 driver.  It happened shortly after resetting it and I was connected via Ethernet so it was updating as it was reinstalling Windows 10.  I wasn't even sure if this Acer laptop had a recovery partition for restoring, and their idea of creating my own restore disc was pitiful like many others. For the second reset, I did it offline and it restored okay without adding Windows 10 junk along the way.  That was three days ago (1/13/2020), but it hasn't been acting right since then.  My backup software that used to work on this computer will no longer backup anything when it worked fine before.  When trying to backup after the two resets it completely wiped my external drive that I used for previous backups. The second victim was plugged into the second USB port which wiped that drive containing a large amount of data files that I normally use to update other drives.  Fortunately those drives were current since this Acer monster ruined this second drive.  After that I decided not to connect any more drives and just backup to my cloud accounts. I have found what seemed to be reliable in the beginning can no longer be trusted.  I'm planning to throw this unreliable data destroyer in the trash after I get a new one.  This was my first (and last) Acer and I was hoping it would be an improvement over two other brands that I found bad.  They don't make good laptops anymore. Here are a few flaws I found for this Acer.  This may not be typical for everybody or other models. 1. Their update software doesn't work.  Even after the one reset offline, the Acer Care Center software never found any updates.  I noticed this before prior to the two BSOD errors.  There are never any updates for anything.  This software must be connected to a server that no longer works.  One other thing, a reset does not install their Acer Care Center software.  You have to hunt for it, download and install it yourself.  Not what I consider user friendly.  Don't bother looking for it since it doesn't work anyway. 2. After the crashes, the fingerprint reader kept losing its settings and even after redoing the fingerprint set up it would never work.  I always had to use the PIN instead. 3. Also after the crashes, I had to keep re-setting up the log in.  I finally turned off all of the security because it was doing it on its own anyway. I will never buy another Acer.  And it started off just fine when I got it.  I no longer love it.  I hate it because it destroyed two external drives that worked just fine on other computers, and they weren't that old.  Prior to this paperweight, I had three other laptops that I got rid of only because they were slow.  They never devoured an external drive.  It helps to keep lots of external backups of the same information.  Not worth sending back.

I do appreciate Intel and Windows so must admit that I wouldn't have bought it if it didn't have an Intel processor and Windows 10; the graphics are also Intel. The Aspire 5 easily connects to wifi in any room of the house and on my back deck. I don't keep deep, dark secrets on my laptop so have never before password-protected one but, for those who want such protection, you can choose a PIN or fingerprint (and perhaps both).  I didn't find an option to skip this security feature so chose the fingerprint and have to admit that, if I wanted that protection, it is a fast and secure way of providing it.  My grown sons tried to \"break in\" just to see if they could and they could not so they're now teasing mom about what must lurk in her browser history.

I had my criteria: at least a 15\" 1080p screen (touch not necessary), the latest generation Intel processor with the glimmer of hope of future-proofing, at least 8 GB of RAM and an SSD for less than $600. Most of the laptops I found were either too high end (such as the Surface Laptop 3 -- used one at a brick and mortar, super premium screen, build and keyboard, but would have ran me almost $1,400 with tax!) or way too cheap, such as a plethora of older gen  i3 based, 1366x768 panel, 4 GB RAM machines in my price range. I found this laptop with some digging, and I believe I made the right choice. My only conern is for the longevity of the keyboard, it doesn't feel super sturdy. PROS: Great 1080p IPS panel, bright and crisp Snappy 10th Generation Intel i5 SSD is super quick Speakers are surpringly adequate Lots of ports! CONS: The fan on this thing revs up loudly and often The keyboard just doesn't feel like it'll last more than a few years I wouldn't game on this thing, not even lightly. NEUTRAL No touch screen. I wouldn't use it for Windows. May be an issue for some. I'm fairly certain this omission kept the price down. Battery life seems OK. I almost always use it plugged in, so I'm not a great source for that. HEADS UP Acer is really weird with driver updates. Windows wasn't activated out of the box. I had to manually run the troubleshooting app in the settings menu to force it to activate. So to wrap up, considering what you get for the price this is a solid machine, other than some reservations as a long term investment. The non-touch screen is really nice and the performance is good. Highly recommended at a mid-range choice."}, {"name": "K.

I noticed it at first but now I don't even hear it. Most of the time I have a fan on in my room and I cannot hear the laptop fan over that. I love the backlit keyboard too. Battery life is ok, but something has to give, right? Make sure you inspect it completely when it arrives. The first one I received was shipped with a dead pixel. I didn't have time to send it to Acer for repairs so I returned it to Amazon and ordered another one. Had no issues whatsoever with the return process. I called Acer and the technician said he never heard of a new device being shipped with a dead pixel. I wondered if mine had been used before, or maybe it was damaged in shipping.

I use my laptop for several hours every day...Im a blogger and freelance writer so for what I need it is more than perfect.  1. This is NOT a touch screen - I don't personally care, since I don't need/want one. 2. The colors are crisp and bright with ample screen space. 3. Comes with 8GB of RAM, however 4GB is welded to the board so it can't be removed. I did purchase 16GB DDR4 SODIMM (Crucial) and replaced the 4GB with the 16 (I now have 20GB of RAM). This has provided me with ample speed for the tasks that I need to perform. It comes with Win10 Home and I think 258GB of SSD. Things I've seen in the reviews that others complain about: THE FAN - so after a week of what I consider med-heavy use, multiple tasks and functions  at once...I think I just heard the fan today. So..it's not LOUD like some reviewers have stated and it lasted for maybe 8 seconds or less. What I was doing when the fan came on..I was in a blanket working and the laptop was on my lap. I'm pretty sure it was cooling itself because I had it covered up. I'm back at my desk for almost 30mins and I've not heard it again.  The fan is not an issue at all. 4. People also complained about the key back lights not staying on a long time. Not sure what they are talking about..The back light stays on as long as you are typing. It will go off if you are NOT touching the keys. Perhaps they mean if you just want to turn them on and off, they only stay lit for a few seconds..but honestly, why would they need to be on if I'm not typing?? I'll list out some quirks that I've had to adjust to (they are not deal breakers or cons, just minor adjustments) Things I've had to get used to: 1. The number keypad - the 0 is off to the left and not in the center where the DEL/. key is. So I have to pay attention to entering numbers because I keep hitting the DEL key and not the 0. Just a weird placement thing I guess. 2. The key pad is off to the left a bit and not dead center so I tend to brush over it if I'm not using an actual mouse. 3. Opening the lid - so this is real thing that takes getting used to. there are little etchings on the corners to help you lift the lid but they are too flat to be useful. Thats more of a design flaw and not a deal breaker. you'll have to slide your finger tips in between the space on the top lid and bottom lid..after a few tries it becomes normal. 4. Taking off the back  panel to upgrade the memory was a pain to get off. you need something to shimy the back off..No way around it..I accidentally scratched the back of my device..it's minor. It's a one time activity so be careful. This device is sleek, thin, beautiful. I needed a new device and didn't want to spend 1000's of dollars. This was about 600 with everything and I'm so happy (so far) that I did. I'll update my post if something changes, but a week in..several posts later, I have no complaints.  A reviewer listed out the memory card to buy and I did just that and it was fine. I actually ordered my memory card the same time I ordered the device so I wouldn't have to wait another 2 days after receiving it.  I love it.

In response to a question about how much this computer's RAM can be upgraded to, Acer stated explicitly \"This model has two memory slots and is upgradeable to max of 32GB. The slots are not considered user accessible but if you feel comfortable removing the bottom case assembly and battery, more memory can be added.\" That is ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE. I've been in the back of my comp, and it is DEFINITELY only one slot available. So the max you're getting out of this model is 16 GB Ram. Infuriating though that be, I'll admit that even at that speed, this computer can handle most of your need. I run quite a bit of data analyses via R and SAS, and this can handle a reasonable load of code. If you're hoping to upgrade the NVMe M.2 SSD, it's worth noting that there's only one slot there as well, so be sure to grab an adapter for the cloning process before you switch out your cards.

This is my first Acer, and my first non box and mortar store laptop purchase. The screen is beautiful and the laptop is very light. I love that it has a number pad and the backlit keyboard. But that's it! My issues are that the sound & videos cards seem not to work correctly, and no amount of updating drivers has fixed it. With the volume all the way up, I can just barely hear it. This is only partly due to the poor placement of the speakers. Something is wrong with the volume. I\u2019m not a computer guru, but I shouldn\u2019t have to be. I\u2019ve checked Acer\u2019s website and Googled solutions in case it was a Windows issue. I\u2019ve gotten correct sound once or twice, but when the laptop is restarted, it reverts back to the settings it had before. I had to wear headphones in order to complete my video trainings for work. All the video programs run in double time speed. The program I used on my previous laptop to play videos won\u2019t play them on this lap top. I finally found a program that would work. My other  complaint is that this takes some special charging cable that is apparently different than every other Acer model made. My cable got damaged, and it took a wrong purchase from Amazon, and an hour on the phone with Acer customer service to figure out what cable was needed. I had to order it from Acer (and wait 10 days for shipping or pay exorbitant fees for overnight) with no way to charge my lap top I use for work. While there are some nice features, I wouldn\u2019t buy it again. Update April 2020. Removing 2 stars. Nothing but one problem after another. The touch pad crapped out for a while.

At school I type my password in 18, 657 times a day so one less step is wonderful.  The processor is fast, as fast as I need it to be anyway.

This machine is lightweight, the build is plastic but still seems sturdy, and it powers through me through lesson plans, Google Classroom, and my photography hobby.  Note I said hobby--a professional photographer may need more than this. It does come with a HDD upgrade kit.  So with a screwdriver and a YouTube video I think anyone can easily upgrade this. I have not upgraded it as I don't see the need.  Oh, and I was easily able to put Cortana to sleep. I do not want any listening devices in my home. Cons- There is no optical drive.

This is my first laptop in over 10 years where I fear I'll have to start using a raised, laptop stand with auxiliary cooling fans. Is there a silver lining to this waste of money? Well, between the fast processor and SSD it restarts quickly--which is a godsend because you'll be restarting this laptop REPEATEDLY. EVERY. DAY. as it constantly knocks itself off of WiFi.

I can't say this is the worst one. I think an eMachine laptop won that award. But this one isn't too many points ahead of it. Maybe I got a lemon. I don't know. My last laptop was a HP and only lasted 18 months (motherboard), only leaving the living room a few times to print something in the bedroom. I had purchased an Acer for my daughter once and it lasted 5 years so bought this one. I've had this almost 5.5 months. I quickly figured out how to take all the fancy stuff off the touchpad, except for 2 finger scroll. I had to learn to deal with that. The problem with the touchpad is sometimes you have to right or left click way in the corner or it doesn't work. Now it's getting so I have to click two or three times before it works. It seems you have to strike it harder too. It doesn't matter which browser I use but it tends to freeze, for the weirdest reasons. Like scrolling, closing a tab, clicking a link, or closing a browser. If I ignore it for a few minutes it will work again. At least a couple times a month this laptop comes out of sleep with a blue screen stating an unexpected error occurred and it had to restart. I'm unable to read the whole thing as the screen doesn't stay up long enough but I did catch \"Unexpected Store Stop\" near the bottom of the screen. I seem to have the WiFi issue others have mentioned but not as bad. It happens every few days I think. It drops for a few minutes, comes back for a few, then drops again, over and over. I don't know how long it lasts as I give up and pull my Kindle out. The latest is the computer beeps, the screen dims, and the battery tries to start charging, even though it's plugged in. The pc figures this out, shows the battery is full, and the screen brightens again. I've tried manipulating the cord to see if there was a short or loose wire as this tends to happen when I move the Acer, even just a tiny bit. I've tried unplugging and letting the battery run down.  After it charges back up it still does it but the beeping seems to stop for a bit.  It now seems to have gotten to the point it just does it. Perhaps it's the vibration from typing?  I'm disabled and sit in my recliner with the laptop balanced on the arm of the chair or the arm and my knee. With all these problems I'm afraid I just can't recommend this computer.

I wanted a good PC. I didn't want the world's most powerful gaming rig, and I didn't want an overpriced snail PC. This computer is for my day to day gaming, and normal tasks, this PC is totally good. Totally normal. MOST importantly, it doesn't suck- And what more can you ask for when investing $850 on a computer you'll own for the next 4-8 years. extra detail, for those that need more convincing: My old laptop was 8 years old. It works great- and it's pretty fast for a 8 year old PC. The time had come to replace is with a new PC. My old PC got me through engineering school, and was pretty great (except its lack of dedicated graphics) My basic requirements were simple. 1) Must be equal or faster than my current PC 2) Must be able to play some of the games I missed out on over the last 8-years. 3) Battery life of greater that 5 hours. This ACER fulfills my totally modest and average requirements! that's why I give it 5 stars (The only drawback- The track-pad isn't amazing. For detailed maneuvering of the cursor; trying to move the mouse one or two pixels is possible, but much more frustrating that it should be.) This is fine for normal tasks, but frustrating for gaming. GET A MOUSE if you want to game) ---------------------------- So, stuff I've been doing since I've been using this PC for a few months: first thing I did was use the BIOS mode to change the F1-f12 keys to be function keys by default, and making pressing [fn]+f1 put the PC to sleep, change volume, brightens ect. rather than the secondary functions being on by default. (if you want to do this, look up how on google- it's pretty simple) I'm really glad that boot time is under 30 seconds. I don't hesitate turning the PC off, rather than leave it on for weeks as I did with my old PC. The charging chord is small. doesn't affect performance at all, but it is a tiny little wire. No optical drive (CD, DVD) so I will need to get a USB CD drive later. I play some pretty basic games, usually in the 10-5 year old window. Cities Skylines is currently my time waster. really no issues playing at all. Minecraft runs great. I've played some CS:CO. It does great for normal online matches (Make sure you get an external keyboard and mouse)."}, {"name": "Kate", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2020", "title": "I love my laptop for schoolwork, coding, and fun!", "review_text": "This laptop is a big bang for your buck situation.

Hands down my favorite feature is the Fingerprint Scanner: VERY fast and and accurate. I'm coming from a Macbook and this is a welcome transition that cost me 1/4 the price. Speaker quality is very good. If you're someone who wants better, you'll probably buy a bluetooth speaker anyway. The weight is fairly light given what it contains and I find it very portable. The build and material feel okay: not super cheap, but you definitely want to be careful with it (I abused my Macbook a bit because it was more resilient.) It's got all the important ports- Doesn't have a disk drive but you don't really need those anymore. It's very thin and fits great into my backpack (I HIGHLY recommend getting a protective case).

Hardwear is nothing special, but does not look or feel overly cheap.  Large track pad that is pretty sensitive, but I use a mouse most of the time and the keyboard is a long reach if you are going to do a lot of typing (and I have long fingers).  Keys function well, but this is always a personal preference.  There is no signal light for \"NUM LOCK\" or \"CAPS\", can be a little annoying, but not that big a deal I guess.  Key backlighting is good. 1080 screen is OK but not all that sharp compared to other slightly more expensive brands.  Internet/browser connections are a bit sluggish, and I do not have a lot apps, and basic security software--this could be Microsoft and Chrome issue as much as the PC.  Actually my biggest complaint is how badly Office 365, especially Outlook perform, after a couple of months still have to reset often, and have not been able to consolidate my multiple mailboxes on Outlook 365--many, many bugs and I guess we can blame both MS and Acer for this.

We've not had any trackpad issues because we have this hooked to a television and use remote keyboard/mouse to interact, but it didn't take long to see why this unit is priced too good to be true. The components are cheap. I mean dirt cheap. I wouldn't be surprised if there isn't a name brand in the unit other than Intel, and I'd question even this at this stage. The biggest complaint we have is the graphics system. We cannot determine if the unit is just so cheap graphics suffer or if the unit is just not capable of dealing with online streaming. We specifically chose the UHD version to help keep costs down, and this should be sufficient for 1080p streaming. I don't think it is.

THE CONNECTIVITY OPTIONS ARE SERIOUSLY LACKING!. There is NO USB-C. If you aren't familiar with USB-C (I wasn't until recently) it is the connector of all connectors. A SINGLE USB-C can be used to add almost dozens of different devices to your computer. A $50 hub can be plugged into a USB-C port and it can support external hard drives, internet ports, HDMI output, headphone jacks, card readers and even charge other devices. A single small USB-C port makes your laptop able to connect to so many more devices. Without one, you limited in so many ways . The Acer Spin 3 comes with only a COUPLE of standard USB ports and a card reader, a headphone jack and an HDMI output. I am constantly trying to plug devices into my laptops and needing more ports, and the Acer Spin 3 just doesn't have many. Another interesting (good) thing about the Acer Spin 3 is that the wall wart or transformer for this computer is very small compared to most of my laptops. It is only 2.4 amps and about 45 watts, which isn't very much really. You could run this off of a good sized powerbank if you had to for a bit. I was torn on how to rank this on stars. On one hand, I am very disappointed in the limitations that the Acer 3 has on connectivity. On the other hand, it is a speedy little devil that is pretty competent at computing. If you are using this in a work environment where you need to do spreadsheets, e-mail, word processing and even photoshop type editing, it is a pretty nice machine with very respectable specs, speed and parts list. If you are looking for something super creative, where you can plug in several things like external hard drives, or drawing pads, or you want an awesome screen - you are going to be frustrated by the lack of USB-C. I'm going with four stars. It is a very good computer. But if it had even just one USB-C port, it would have been a great computer. I hope you find this review helpful. I feel like that reviews are super important on Amazon and they really help me determine if a product is worth buying or not - so I try to return the favor and leave a review that will honestly tell you whether a product is good or not. We all use products differently, so I also try to make it clear what was important to me, and hopefully that makes it easy for you to tell if you will like it too. I also think it is important for Amazon shoppers to stick together and let each other know if a product is garbage. I WILL let you know if a product isn't good, so you can avoid the hassles of returning a product or a product you lose money on. PLEASE go to my profile page and reach out to me if you have any questions. I enjoy writing reviews and try to respond to any questions about a product ASAP. Thank you for reading my review."}, {"name": "Dean Burns", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2019", "title": "4.5/5 Fantastic for work!", "review_text": "I\u2019ve used a lot of Mac and PC laptops in the past, and this particular model of the Spin 3 is my favorite for work so far. As a photographer and videographer, my work demands a lot of RAM and processing power, and that is where this PC excels. I can have Photoshop and Lightroom open at once, working back and forth between both programs, and the computer keeps up beautifully. The included rechargeable pen works with the full Adobe suite without any setup required \u2014 and it\u2019s even pressure-sensitive! Extremely handy and natural feeling. The Spin 3 IS powerful enough to edit big projects in Premiere Pro, but after a certain point, some lag becomes inevitable. Still, I am surprised it handles large files as well as it does. I usually work with extremely large 4K videos formatted in ProRes CODEC, and the Spin handles them without any programs crashing. The downside of this PC, however, is its integrated graphics card. While cheaper and more energy-efficient, an integrated GPU is a great deal slower than a dedicated GPU when it comes to video editing, gaming, and other graphics-intensive tasks. So despite its fantastic processor and RAM, the Spin is just short of being the workstation it could be. The fan also blasts much louder than any other laptop I\u2019ve used, even with just a browser and a few tabs open, and it gets pretty hot. However, despite its disadvantages, the Spin 3 remains powerful enough to work on the go, and if necessary, at least get a start on projects that can be finished on more powerful computers later. It features a beautiful touchscreen display, a good trackpad, an SD card reader, and a keyboard that feels pretty similar to older MacBooks. I would summarize it as a mid-level workstation \u2014 not quite as powerful as it could be, but more than adequate for dozens of professional tasks. I highly recommend it! There is not much to complain about."}, {"name": "King of Reviews", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2019", "title": "Great Price to Performance!", "review_text": "Despite my first dismal experience with amazon\u2019s shipping with the product arriving late and looking like it had been dropped kicked, my initial experience with the laptop. Speed: This boy is equipped with one of the fastest ssd\u2019s available at a respectable size, 16gb of ram (a must in todays era), and a 4 core 8 thread processor. This cpu tends to score a 4787 on single threaded loads and a 13130 on multithreaded loads accourding to geekbench. \"Geekbench 4 scores are calibrated against a baseline score of 4000 (which is the score of an Intel Core i7-6600U). Higher scores are better, with double the score indicating double the performance.\" My particular machine scored a 5259 on the single threaded test and a 15849 on the multithreaded. It should also be considered that i had firefox running at the time of my tests which was utilizing around 5% of my cpu. The screen: the screen is beautiful and has amazing viewing angles as most ips panels, though when compared to my Pixio PX275H, which has a high color gambit, the colors did appear to be slightly more muted. The hinges are great when comparing it to a family members asus notebook that was bought earlier this year. Unlike the asus it doesnt lock up in odd orientations. The touch screen is responsive and the pen is adequate for light photoshop work. The pen does lack the capability for the finer details and the buttons on it lack any meaningful programability. The brightness is average. Not the brightest screen ive seen but certainly not the dullest. I used mine at about 40% in a well lit room and 60-70% in a sunlit room. Battery life: at a balanced setting and an average use case this will last about 6 hours. This time can be increased if you use the optimal battery saving options and set the gpu to prioritize battery life when the system is unplugged. The keyboard and touchpad: this keyboard feels amazing! Its nice and solid and the keys are firm and dont wiggle. The backlight is nice and crisp\u2014but not over bearing\u2014and can be turned off. The touch pad is large and responsive and handles all the gestures excellently. The finger scanner is just as fast as touch id on my iphone 6s which is nice. The io: only 2 usbs? Not even a type c? Why acer! It would be more acceptable if both usbs were 3.1 but one of the usbs is a 2.0 which has way slower speeds. (When compared to its 10gbps 3.1 brethren) That port is basically only useful for a mouse dongle. It does have a sd card reader which is nice, but it juts out too far in my opinion. It could have easily been designed to fit more snugly into the system upon viewing the interior of the system. The full size hdmi is a plus and the powerbrick for the laptop is super small. The power connector also swivels for optimal placement. Gaming: this is not a gaming machine. This machine shines brightest in its productivity workloads. The integrated graphics should be able to run most competitive games like rocket league, csgo, fortnite, and overwatch at low to medium settings. It can run minecraft with optifine at around 50fps on average with a beefy texture pack. Upgradability: the laptop is equipped with 8gb of ram soldered to the board and an 8gb stick of ddr4 ram. Acer has confirmed that this motherboard can utilize 24gb if you were to swap that 8gb stick for a 16gb. The NVME drive is relatively easy to access and swap out for a 1tb if you so wish. Theoretically you could also try adding a 2.5in drive as there is an empty bay for it. If you were to do that you would need to acquire a ribbon cable connector. I have tried one from an SP315 model with no success, but that may be due to a defective wire. I currently have ordered a cable from an SP314 model to see if i have any luck with that. I will update if im successful. I got my system on prime day for $100 off, but even at its full $800 price tag this system is tempting. You wont find all these features on another laptop at this price point. The closest thing i could find was an ultrathin at the same price by acer, but it had only 8gb of ram and no touchscreen and pen support. I would recommend this pc for your average user.

A metal body would be nice (this one shows smudges and recently got a scratch although I'm not sure how since the lid was shut and the scratch was by the touchpad). I have yet to need it for anything particularly resource intensive but no issues using it for Word, PDFs, Internet, and the like. It's also not all that common that I hear it's fans go into overdrive and make a ruckus. I try to use a lap desk whenever I'm not at a desk but even when I don't, it hasn't gotten as hot as the first day when it was too hot to leave on my lap. In short, if my previous cons list had led me to only give 4 stars, I would bump it up to a 5 now, but it was a five-star purchase from the start. :) (Summary at the bottom) PROS: -This is a pretty reasonable deal when you compare to the cost of getting the same specs on other laptops. I was mainly looking at Dell and Lenovo and the best I found from them was Lenovo's 2019 Flex 6 14\". Biggest difference between the specs that mattered to me was the Lenovo only cost $750 but also only had an i5 processor. The specs that mattered to me were processor, hard drive capacity, SSD, screen resolution, size, weight, RAM, and that it was a 2-in-1. -I haven't used much more than Chrome, Adobe PDF reader and Excel yet so I haven't tried to max out computer resources but I can verify that there's no lag with normal use. Restart takes 20 seconds from hitting restart to being logged in with the fingerprint scanner. -3rd party reviews from sites like PCMag of the 2018 model complained about the keys not depressing far enough to be comfortable typing a lot. While a slightly longer keystroke would feel more satisfactory to me, it's not so shallow that I would avoid it for large quantities of writing. -FHD seems like a good resolution on a 14\" screen. HD is not considered high res these days but I doubt the improvement of a 4K screen would be worth the cost, if you could even notice a significant difference between the two screens. -My last laptop had a 15.6\" screen so it was a bit of a risk cutting down on screen space but 14\" doesn't feel cramped the way 11\" or even 13\" does. It doesn't feel small unless it's sitting right next to my old laptop. The weight savings of having a smaller laptop are definitely worth it! -It's got a plastic body but it doesn't feel flimsy or cheaply built for the most part. The few minor exceptions are in my Cons list. -Fingerprint scanner was a bonus for me. It works very nicely -Stylus is handy in tablet mode. I didn't buy the laptop for the stylus so I can't speak to it's quality but I was able to make some fun art messing around in Inkscape with it. I don't know how it would work for professional-level art since the limiting factor for me is that I'm still pretty new to Inkscape. CONS: -Doesn't have the 12-hour battery life they advertise but then again, what laptop ever has the full capacity advertised? I would guess it's actually around 6-8 hours, which is still pretty reasonable. Tip: look up Acer's recommendations for battery charging before you set it up. I know it's important to go through a few full charge cycles when you first get it to extend the battery life but I forget the details of their recommendation. -It does get hot and use the fans at full speed pretty easily. The vents are on the bottom of the laptop and along the hinged edge whereas my last laptop had them on the left edge so with this one, I can almost guarantee you'll want to set it on a lap desk or large book rather than directly on your lap if you're going to be using it for a longer sitting. I'll probably eventually get a lap desk with cooling fans built in. That said, there's only been a couple times the fans have gotten noisy when it wasn't on my lap and when I moved it off my lap after it got too hot to be comfortable, it cooled down very quickly. -The charging plug is surprising small - probably to help keep the laptop thin. I don't mind that but it still has a lot of wobble to it when it's plugged in so my preference is to unplug it again once the battery is fully charged. -Indoors with a room well-lit by ambient daylight, having the brightness at about 65% is comfortable for me. This doesn't leave a lot of buffer to amp it up outside in the sun but I'm not surprised that's not what laptops are designed for. -Same with the volume - max volume was comfortable if not a bit quiet outdoors but if I wanted to broadcast music outside, I'd use a portable speaker anyways. In the home, I haven't felt the need to max out the volume though. -There's a couple rubber feet and you can see some of the places the screen clips into the frame, which gives it a bit cheaper aesthetic but nothing major. I'll probably get used to it. -Bezel along the top and sides is reasonable but it's pretty thick along the bottom - probably 3/4\" of visible case, which makes sense because of the hinges, but then another 1\"+ of glossy black before the screen actually starts. The only thing in that space, at least externally, is the Acer logo. The result is it makes the task bar look really far up. -Probably the thing I dislike the most is that the casing used for the 360 hinges has a see-your-reflection-in-it type of shiny surface. Maybe it's just personal taste but it makes them look like cheap plastic. It's also annoying when I'm in a room with low lighting and they catch the glare from a lamp behind me. SUMMARY: It has some quirks I don't care for but I bought it mainly for the processing power and portability. More money would probably fix the quirks but thanks to other reviews, I wasn't surprised by any of them."}, {"name": "Sardorbek Mamadjanov", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2019", "title": "Generally a good laptop.", "review_text": "Generally the laptop is good.

When its on and running it is great. Very useful and way better than any laptop or tablet that i have ever had. BUT, the issue is that if I bump the power button (even for just a monent), if I leave it on with the screen open for to long, or if I close the screen while it is on, it will completely freeze it EVERY SINGLE TIME! As in nothing works, black screen, keyboard backlit, and a blinking orange light on the side. I have to then use a paper clip and press the battery pull/reset button in order to get it to re-start. I always assumed this would get fixed by one of the frequent updates, but I was very wrong. I finally contacted ACER. First through the chat option. This was very generic and was told 2 steps. One was to reset factory bios (?) settings on start up and of course the next was to FULLY WIPE and system restore. So lose all of my files on the computer. Well the bios reset did nothing. Then I called and a rather rude support lady told me I was not properly shutting off my computer. And that you should never close the screen without properly shutting it all the way down. And that I should not be pressing the battery pull button often, like I enjoy my brand new 800 dollar computer freezing all the time.  She had me do a operating system restore on it, in which it then froze a few times in the middle of. Thats never happened before this! She was in a big hurry to get off the phone so refused to stick around till it finished up. Well this didnt fix anything either.  SO I called back again and finally got a guy that actually knew something about computers. We worked together and found what he says is the issue. BUT, it needs to be shipped to them, AT MY COST, and I need to buy something to back up all my files to cause they say my computer will be completely wiped when it comes back.

In the past I've resorted to using one computer for professional work and one for personal but cheap computers are horrid things. I've bought a couple Acers in the past - chromebooks - basically to keep family out of my \"real\" computers. Frankly, that was what I was expecting again - another Acer that would be used for small family chats and other miscellaneous. I was pleasantly surprised to encounter a light weight, very versatile and downright peppy performance on this new model. First the good - out of the box this can be turned on and set-up. Cortana literally talks you through the process and it takes just a few minutes. Add a couple more for syncing with other accounts and you are done. The built in stylus is responsive and sensitive as is the touch screen capacity. The fingerprint security is terrific - works very well. This comes pre-loaded with some junk and games that I have no interest in so cannot comment on that but also has basic office software and the Microsoft/Google Edge.

Meanwhile I downloaded my normal browsers and set-up a few other features...transfer rates were excellent as were launch/use. Everything is zippy - no major lag times encountered anywhere. The keyboard is comfortable but much to my surprise, this is so versatile that I found myself using the touch screen and voice instructions frequently. I absolutely love the ability to swap it around to type/work on a paper then switch to tablet mode while reading. Normally I work with dual monitors and often have a laptop beside me but this felt natural and able to switch naturally. Resolution looks good whether reading or launching a movie - I spent some time playing around with various media files and again, fast uploads and downloads, good picture.

Normally a dell, hp or Apple Mac compute in that specs are around 1800 USD - 2000 USD. Acer is generally known for its pice-performance  compare to the market.  I did not want to pay Apple MacBook or Dell that much money and wanted to go with cheap option, and I will tell you why I regret it. Here is my review on it and suggestion that why you should not buy it. 1-  It looks like the laptop is covered with cheap plastic. If you drop it , I can guarantee that it won't work it again. 2 - The fans are noisy. 3- Battery life is 4-6 hours, not 12 hours as advertised. I mean it is 4-6 hours with a basic task like running Microsoft Word and Chrome and checking your e-mails etc. 4- There are several times that touch pad freezes and then it works again. This happened to me after using it for 3 weeks. What I mean by freezing is that, it won't fully sense your finger while you are using it and it will partially move to the point that you want to drag the pointer. 5-  Once the battery is low and then you plug in the charger, the laptop won't work with its full CPU. It will work slower than usual until the battery is up to %30. It gets so slow and you can even see it while typing. The letters come later to the screen after you type. 6- If you want to use it on tablet mod and want to use it in bed or just in a meeting, the laptop gets hot since the fans are located under the laptop. AndIt is so heavy, you will need good muscles to hold it. I bought that laptop because of the great price for its specs. I would buy Macbook or Dell because I know that they will last longer. Especially Macbook. Now I regret it because probably this laptop will be broken in couple of months, and I would need to spend money on new Mac.

Barbosa", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2019", "title": "Sturdy and reliable.", "review_text": "I have been using this laptop for a month. First, the laptop arrived in excellent conditions. No scratches, no missing parts. It boots up very quickly, indeed. After turning it on for the first time, it required me to provide few information and, after about five minutes it was fully configured. Then, I updated the base language to my native language, which took another twenty minutes or so. After that, I have been using it without problems, except a few snags. I will explain it below. 1- Screen and touchscreen \u2013The screen is bright, clear, swiftly responsive upon touch and accurate. The rim around the screen is very thin, making it looks like the screen occupies the whole facing plate. Tablet mode switch window automatically pops-up when the screen is flipped over. The screen plate hinge built is sturdy. It seems to me it will be able to do the job flipping over and over for a long time. Pen is also accurate (Added on 11/20/2019 - I mean, fairly accurate. A small four points star reflects the contact point of the pen when it touches the screen exactly underneath. However, if you lift up the pen tip from the screen, just a few millimeters, and moves the pen around without contact, you will notice that the star indicating the pen tip position underneath falls behind and takes a while to update the exact position.) 2 - Core i7 CPU, 16 Gb RAM, 512 Gb SSD set - Very nice. CPU-Z version 1.89.1x64 rates the CPU as 1605.1 for multi thread and 358.8 for single thread. (multithread ratio 4.47), running Norton antivirus, MS OneDrive and MS Defender in background. Number of USB ports (2.0 and 3.1, type A one of each) is Ok for me. There is one HDMI 1.4b port and one SD card reader port. Double antenna ac WiFi, Bluetooth. 3 - Battery life - Using factory settings, it will certainly last between 4 h and 6 h. Adjusting battery settings to economy mode, Intel Graphics Control Panel to maximum battery autonomy, dimming screen brightness to minimum, turning off both Bluetooth and location (GPS) facility, and keeping the keyboard backlight on, battery will probably last between 10 h and 12 h (Battery gauge indicates remaining charge for 10 h at 94 %). When using it continuously for text writing and internet surfing, it will probably last up to 8 h. Turning keyboard backlight off will make it last a little longer, perhaps. 4 - Keyboard \u2013 This is the reason I gave it 4 stars (and stated almost flawlessly, above). I would have given 4.5 if it would be possible. The keyboard is backlit, which is very good. It dims off automatically a few seconds after the last hit, and turns light on as one types. It can also be permanently turned off, if necessary. Fingerprint sensor works Ok and activates the laptop swiftly. I had to relearn the positions of arrows, page up/down. In addition, home/end functions are only accessible via pressing simultaneously Fn & pgup/pgdn, which has been tricky since I started using it. The point is that the experience offered by Spin 3 keyboard typing makes me feel like the keys are not exactly loose, but not so tight either. Sometimes, it duplicates the character when I press the key once, like 'nn', 'aa', 'rr', 'ee', and 'oo'. As I type quickly, now and then I must come back, erase the character typed in double, and retype the word again (as I am doing it right now). (Added on 11/17/2019 - In my opinion, the problem escalates here when I type a password to enter an account. This double typing glitch may cause unwillingly [as it really does few times] password errors. In a plausible scenario where you are about to register an website account and enter the password for the first time, if a mistyping happens then, you will have to rescue your password ahead, at least.) I think this a chronic problem. This is my second ACER laptop. The first one, Aspire V5 touchscreen core i5, I bought it five years ago is overall working fine, by the way (Refer to a review I have made of Acer Aspire V5). The issue is that key pressing results in double tying in Aspire V5 as it does in Spin 3. However, Spin 3 typing experience has improved in relation to Aspire V5. Mouse-pad is Ok and fingerprint sensor works fine. Overall, I am glad about my acquisition, and I think this has been an excellent laptop for the price. Keyboard needs to improve.

It is fast and the touch screen is great.  The negatives:  battery life is about 6 hours and the fingerprint reader has not worked for me since day 3. I really do like this Acer Spin 3 2-in-1 laptop.  The combination of the 8th generation i7 processor, 16gb of ram and the 512 Solid State Drive make this machine very fast and I have yet to bog it down.  It is a lot faster than my desktop computer, which is about 2 years old and has 12 gb of ram and a standard 1tb hard drive.  The integrated graphics card is basic and would not be useful for a person that does a lot of video editing or hardcore gaming, neither of which I do.  The backlit keyboard works well. The 14 inch screen is exactly what I was looking for because a 15.6 would be to big for me to carry around daily and a 13.3 seemed a touch small.  I have watched many videos on the 1080p HD screen and it looks great, but then again it is only 14 inches so even 720p or possibly 480p would look good on this size.  The touch screen works great, I have had zero issues with it. The laptop has all of the connections I require, but it would have been nice if it had a USB-C.  When I purchased the laptop I knew it did not have a USB-C, so I fine with that.  The other outstanding specs in this machine were more important to me. Regarding battery life, so far the best I have really done is about 6 hours or half of which the manufacture claimed.  Unfortunately, half the battery life is par for the course when it comes to laptops.  Also the thumb print reader only worked for a few days even though I cleaned it.  Luckily I have been able to login with my PIN, but one day I did have an issue that said my PIN was not valid.  A restart of the computer appeared to fix that issue. All-in-all it is a nice laptop that performs well.  I want to rate it 5 stars, but due to the thumb print reader and battery life I am giving it 4 stars.  I would purchase this 2-in-1 again.

I am a college student who just wants a laptop that I can easily carry around so I can bring it around campus and study anywhere I want. Did it do that? Yes! I also want to be able to play most games smoothly and without lag. Did it do that? Yes! Here are some other things great about this laptop: It has 16 GB of ram which is more than enough. Trifold functions allow me to relax at my bed and watch YouTube. Despite the lightweight, its outer is very protective and not made of plastic. You can use your fingerprint as your password. The fan makes a quiet background noise that you wouldn't notice at all if you don't focus on it when it tries to cool off your laptop. The keyboard is very easy to type on. The keyboard lights up when you type on it(unnecessary to me but I guess that looks cool :) ) Long-lasting battery. The battery charges up fast. Here are some of the little flaws about it(doesn't bother me that much): You can't leave the laptop more than halfway open because it would close instead of staying open. No place to insert disk(I get it though, it's not big enough to have an opening for a disk). The battery is great but it certainly does not last 12 hours 99.99% of the time. You have to turn on the ultimate battery saver mode to be able to let the battery lasts 8-12 hours. I don't need it to last 12 hours but I'm just a bit disappointed that it does not meet the Amazon description that says it could last up to 12 hours. However, in most cases, it would approximately last 4-6 full hours and 6-8 hours if you take breaks in between the periods you use the laptop. The battery is good enough for most of us. And there you go. If you are a college student like me who just want to laptop to perform basic functions and study and occasionally relax by playing games and watching YouTube, this is the laptop for you. If you are a gamer or a business person, this would not be a bad option but it is not designed for you.

I haven\u2019t used Windows machines much at all for many years, but I wanted to try Windows 10 and the 2-in-1 form factor, so non-touch laptops were out. Cheaper 2-in-1\u2019s are surely available, but the i7 CPU, good-sized SSD, and 16GB of RAM, along with good experiences I\u2019ve had with Acer machines in the past, led me to this machine. I\u2019ve found it really pleasant to use and have found myself picking it up often for casual use. With Windows 10, it switches effortlessly between laptop and tablet modes, handling both portrait and landscape mode automatically. I didn\u2019t know how well direct screen touch would work with Windows apps, since most of them were designed with a mouse in mind, but modern apps like Microsoft News work nicely with big fingers. I also appreciate the fact that the system didn\u2019t come with a lot of extra junk apps installed. Although I\u2019m not a gamer, I have fond memories of the Mechwarrior series of games, so I installed Mechwarrior Online on the Spin. It was playable, but a little sluggish; I think I\u2019d get frustrated with its responsiveness in a pitched battle. Older games seem to work pretty well, so if you want to revisit some classics from GOG.com, for example, the Spin will serve well. The only nits I\u2019d pick are the lack of a thumb relief notch to make opening the lid easier and the fact that the machine\u2019s a bit heavy for tablet-style browsing. The fingerprint reader requires more than one try pretty often, and of course, one could always use more battery life.

On the face of it, it is a good computer but I can't give it a high rating because there are problems.  On the computer I got the Bluetooth was was not functional. I didn't discover that until a week later.  I needed to used the Bluetooth. It could not discover any  Bluetooth audio devices. I tried a speaker  and a headphone. After some fiddling around I decided to call customer service.  I got a tech support person whose English skills were limited (he probably would have done alright with chat, but that was not available). I had to repeat myself a lot. After a while of what I assume was running diagnostics he confidently stated it was a hardware problem and I needed to mail it to Acer.  He  couldn't or wouldn't  tell me where on the planet where it would be mailed to.  He said the return label  and return instructions would come to me in an email.  At the time of this writing I'm still waiting.   The Bluetooth thing wouldn't be so important if the computer had better speakers. The speakers on my smart phone sound better. The other problem is the lack of a Caps Lock indicator, not a big problem unless you want to enter a password and the site doesn't let you see what you're typing.   I was optimistic at first because I had called tech support when I got my computer. I couldn't find the stylus which  was inside the computer and not packaged separately. I called the number given on a card that said something like, \"before you return this, call us.\"  I got an answer right away. I had lost that number before I called again which is probably why I got a second tier tech and a 10 min wait time.   Other than that, the display and the camera are crisp, and the keyboard has back lighting and a solid feel. The response time for loading a page is virtually instantaneous.

I use a workstation for just about everything else. Not too much crap-ware installed, aside from what comes with Windows 10 already..

I do see the possibilities with a usb-c connection, but with 3.0 and hdmi only good as a cheap hub, those complaining are missing the point of the product. It was not a deal breaker for me. The only design features I am not sure how I feel about are: the location of the fingerprint scanner in the touch-pad and the huge gap for the bezel to screen. My ring size is 20 and my hands can span about 14 inches. (take a bunch of bananas and put on the keyboard and you have an analog. So for me most of the time my hands are blocking the taskbar for me, not so much with this one. I kind of like it.

The size of the laptop is right where it should be and at about 14\", it is portable for on the go people. I recommend a good case in order to keep it safe. The only gripe is the battery life, as if you are running multiple programs, it may run out faster than expected. In my experience, I ran Google Meets, Sheets, Docs, Your Phone, and had multiple webpages open, and it lasted for about a good 5 hours before battery ran low.

First things first, the touch screen works great. Super responsive. Same with the stylus. The only thing I don\u2019t like about the stylus is...it\u2019s a little small. Someone with big hands might find it hard to work with. But other than that, it\u2019s good. The 14 inch screen is a good size. I don't feel like it needs to be any bigger or smaller, just right. The fingerprint reader works like a charm. Sometimes it will have trouble picking up your fingerprint, but with some slight readjustments it works fine. The mousepad is great and I\u2019ve encountered no problems with it thus far. I\u2019ve had this laptop for several months and these are my TWO BIGGEST GRIPES. One: the battery life. I bought this laptop for school and the biggest thing that stands out is the BATTERY LIFE. DO NOT LISTEN to what Acer or Amazon says. This laptop does NOT get 12 hours of battery life. If that is a big deal for you, then please look for another laptop. I would say it can get 6-8 hours of battery life, 8 if you\u2019re pretty lucky. Now please note I have never run a battery test on this laptop, this is just coming from my personal experience. IF you\u2019re buying this laptop for school, then I wouldn\u2019t worry about. I have never had to use this for more than a couple hours at a time, so, personally, I don\u2019t think the battery life is too bad. My SECOND gripe is...it feels cheap. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the specs for this laptop at this price range are insane (btw, please don\u2019t expect to do hardcore gaming on this, it will drain the battery, look elsewhere if you want a gaming laptop), but it just...feels cheap. It\u2019s made of this cheap-feeling plastic (excluding the screen of course), which makes it feel like it will get completely destroyed after one drop on hard concrete. Now, notice I said cheap-FEELING. I have no clue what this thing can with stand or what it\u2019s made of, I\u2019m just telling you that, in my opinion, it feels cheap. However other than these two complaints, everything feels great. It super quick and snappy and have encountered very little problems with it. It spins around and works just fine when putting it into tablet mode, (though I don\u2019t use this mode that often myself). Keyboard is good, love the backlighting. Not too loud, and I don\u2019t feel that it gets that hot, (but I haven\u2019t been doing intense stuff with it at the same time). Again, idk what suits you personally but for me, the ports are fine. All I find myself using is the USB, HDMI, headphone jack, and charging port (obviously). I don\u2019t feel that it takes that long to charge, maybe a couple hours. Before I wrap this up, one final (small) gripe I have to talk about is the speaker. I\u2019m not a tech-savvy person (as you probably noticed) so I couldn\u2019t tell you what exactly is wrong with the speaker. It just feels...mediocre. It\u2019s not the worst I\u2019ve ever heard but it\u2019s nowhere close to being the best. It\u2019s just...ok. Certainly not a deal breaker for this laptop though. In conclusion, this is an AMAZING laptop for its price with a few issues (battery life, plastic, speaker), but honestly, every laptop has its problems. With the Acer Spin 3, the good DEFINITELY outweighs the bad for this laptop. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great, reasonably priced laptop."}, {"name": "jammy3", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2020", "title": "Touch screen is a great feature", "review_text": "This is a great computer in many respects, The specs of the computer are great and it is fast and snappy.

So, I called Acer directly.  They had me run through a number of steps that I'd already done on my own and decided (surprise) the recovery partition was hosed.  They sent me a USB recovery drive (11 long days of waiting with no working system.  And upon receiving it the system would no recognize the USB drive.  They then had me send them the system 2 days there as I'd arranged to expedited shipping 10 days in their repair facility and another 5 days for them to slow ship it back to me.  At that point the system had been nonfunctional or out for repair longer than I'd actually had it.  Yesterday it started getting funky again keyboard problems now.  After calling them once more and instead of putting up with another extended delay for them to play silly games I found a keyboard driver that would work on the system.  And fixed it myself.  Now admittedly I did used to work in tech support for computers a few years ago so may know more than most.  But really, I should not know more about their system than they do.  The system I note uses the new Unified Extensible Firmware Interface or UEFI for short which is a software version of an old BIOS system.  But being completely software dependent if it has a problem and you don't have another copy of it.  It's suddenly a rather expensive doorstop.  I liked my old BIOS system which could not be corrupted with out some major effort to do so.  UEFI in a few years will most likely be a good stable replacement for a BIOS but I'll hold off on buying another system from ACER for a while at least.

When I got accepted to the university of London. One of the first things I was told I needed was a laptop. Not just any PC; but a laptop. So immediately I was looking for something that's easy to move around with because of my busy life and also that has a stylus for running thru PDFs on Microsoft edge and highlighting as I go through tons of cases. This PC proves to be excellent. I will say it is NOT A LIGHT WEIGHT PC. At about 4lbs you can definitely tell when it's in hand. But I would brush that off when I consider I Got a pc with the specs of the latest flagship of other companies for 600USD less. I don't need a thunderbolt. So I didn't see the need to spend the extra 100USD to have it and the present usb 3.1 port fast charges my phone.  A plus for me. Also the screen is remnant of a 2014 flagship.  It's better than my iPad mini 1. But shows significantly less radience/saturation in colors than on my Samsung Galaxy Note 9.  It's somewhere in the middle. As it's for school and not graphic design I'm not bothered. I'd advise that if u have to use it for precise editing that you connect it to an external monitor as it does have the POWER needed for most intermediate work and an external screen won't cost much.

I have to say it is a very well rounded laptop. Very capable laptop for the price. I'll start with the processing capabilities, being an engineer I often find myself working on this laptop, most of all while on the road, and it never lets me down, very powerfull processor and coupled with the SSD and 16 GBs of RAM, you can run pretty much anything, I run AutoCAD, GIS, Lightroom, Photoshop, Premiere, and other software and the little machine never lets me down. I travel a lot so it being very light is a plus, the fact that it is 2 in 1 makes it a great companion to watch movies on the plane. Battery life is great, not the 12 hour life as advertised but I get between 8 or 9 hours doing light work or watching movies. Which is not bad at all. I don't use it as a tablet as much, but sometimes when laying in bed is nice to put it in my belly with the keyboard facing down to have the screen closer to me, the screen has good enough brightness, a bit dim I have to say but very good quiality images and sound is not bad either, although I do not care much about it since I always use my bluetooth headphones. Ok, now the cons. The overall build of the laptop is very plasticky, almost cheap, I guess they focused on the inner more than on the outs. Being plastic all over its very prone to scratching and peeling, I hate that, eventually would look for a skin or something to protect it. Also, the screen frame is quite flimsy, you can see sometimes a change of color on the screen due to the frame bending, at first I thought there was something wrong with the display but its just that is not very sturdy. Another thing I don't enjoy very much is the keyboard, it is weird, the travel of the keys is short and kinda sticky and in my case the S key sometimes was stuck, when I pressed it took like half a second to pop back up, it has gone away with use but it was very annoing, I even tried to remove it and clean ot but it still happened. The only thing that would make me swith to a new laptop sooner than I would like is the fact that it does not have a USB C port, nowadays everything uses USB C, even for charging the laptop and this one doesn't have one, that was almost a deal breaker for me. Also, keep in mind that this laptop being a 2in1 does not have a built in ethernet port. I gave it four stars either way because is it very realiable, lightweight and I use it a lot and everytime it comes trough for me.

I opened the laptop screen and voila. Three big issues, 1) The laptop display panel was coming out from the laptop lid so much so that the backlight and everything was visible (see attached image for reference). 2) One of the display hinges (right hand side) had already gone kaput. It\u2019s alignment was off and the display was swinging back and forth without any adjustment being done. 3) The touch pad was a nightmare. Not sure if it was just my laptop or if it\u2019s the same with all Acer Spin 3s - the touchpad kept getting depressed for every touch when in reality it should actually get depressed that much only while clicking. The fact that the touchpad surface wasn\u2019t all that great by itself wasn\u2019t helping matters. The whole laptop (construction and quality of a materials used) felt a little cheap and plasticky. Didn\u2019t read this on any other reviews so I thought I\u2019d mention this - the power button is placed very weirdly on the left side of the laptop towards the front. Quite an odd position and not very comfy either to use. PROS - I used the laptop for a couple hours and the battery life seems to be good.

For one, while the computer seems generally fingerprint-resistant, I've had issues with smudges already and they're a little rough to remove sometimes - especially sticker residue (which I believe I got a little bit of from the specs sticker). Two, I'm not a fan of the bezels and the screen ratio in tablet, though I understand why the large bezels in some spots may be necessary.

The wifi toggle key on the keyboard as well as num/caps lock keys are pretty annoying, there is no indicator lights to display their toggled status, so you will have to run your usual linux commands to check their status while installing, be careful with the network toggle key while installing. Currently, the drivers for the touch display screen are not available in Linux for this model of Acer, so there is absolutely no luck in getting xournal++ up and running after a successful installlation of your OS and GUI. I'm using it as a travel laptop for linux development, and for that purpose it is incredibly useful. It's light, it's generally pretty powerful with adequate ram for running containers and server instances. I highly recommend for installing Linux.

Therefore having all of my household devices disconnected from the wifi for about 2 minutes while my modem and router turn back on. I've never had this problem happen before until I bought this laptop. The issue happened right out of the box. I checked for updates and went through their IT support for about 5 times doing various things, but they couldn't fix it. At the end they told me to call my wifi provider and ask if it was comparable, I've never heard of this issue before so I decided to return the product. For the good. It was an amazing laptop other than the wifi issue. I thought it was amazing as of what you get for this price. It took like 2-4 seconds to turn on from shut down, and everything else seemed to have worked fine. The only downside I had was the graphics card, but it wasn't a problem since it isn't a gaming laptop.

Haven't used the laptop long enough yet to test out the battery life, but the computer is built solid, despite the materials being stated as plastic, it doesn't feel cheap to me. The backlit keyboard is great, the mousepad works well and the touchscreen is a nice additional feature.

The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..). Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery. 2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is. The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough. The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive. Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted. A couple of things that annoy me: -The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting... -The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off. -The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector.

It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money. _____________________ This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain. I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly. What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there. On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything. Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.

Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor. The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop. This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop. Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect. Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing. Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem. The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price. I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need. The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured. This boots in about 15 seconds. It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with. This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING. I can't sing the praises of this enough. Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all.

It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable. I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back. Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up. I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect. I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus! So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you!

Just needs a couple inexpensive upgrades", "review_text": "Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too. Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board). The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places. UPGRADES: I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow. I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with. Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode. Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer. Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop. For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

The processing power is not very strong, so performance-wise, I was not impressed. But with the pricetag considered, I'm all right with this. However, the biggest thing for me is the OS- WINDOWS 10-IN S MODE. I had never heard of S Mode, and I didn't notice this when I bought the laptop. Apparently, S Mode is Microsoft's way of ensuring that you only use their apps and products by blocking you from downloading any outside apps. You have to get them all through their store. So, for example, were I to try to download Norton's anti-virus from Norton's official site, Microsoft's S Mode would tell me that I am unable. Any and all files outside of their store are blocked from being downloaded. In order to leave S Mode, you have to change it in the settings, but then you have to use a registration key for Windows 10 Home or Pro. So I shelled out another $130 just to get a fully functioning OS. Factor that price into this laptop price. THEN- after purchasing Windows 10 Home, I had to keep trying over the course of 4 days for the laptop to accept me switching out of S Mode because Microsoft was conveniently having server errors on their side and so my request could not be processed at this time. This is a common issue, at least from what I read among those discussing S Mode on Reddit forums. Multiple people report that Microsoft has server issues when you try to opt out of S Mode. Very very unhappy with this laptop for the sole reason that the OS is Windows 10 in S Mode. It was inconvenient and one of the most useless things I have ever seen pre-installed on a computer.

I know the OEM RAM is 2666 but it REALLY does't matter. 2666 is the highest clock the OEM will support, but this CPU can only run up to 2400 MHz. When clock is 2400 both RAM have zero difference, but the current prices for both speed are different. In terms of SSD slot upgrade, I would recommend Samsung's EVO which is definitely the best out there. Most reliable and fastest in its class.

For starters, some background context: I am in my mid-20s and have long since finished uni. I am not a gamer. I primarily use my laptop(s)/tablets for streaming shows/movies; occasionally working from home; and crafting/design editing. I used to go through every iteration of a MacBook but, while nice, soon found myself not really utilizing all of its features & could no longer justify its price-point (especially since I do still have an iPhone). This laptop is a STEAL for ~$300. I did my research and honestly, like a majority of the other reviews here said, the Acer Aspire 5 blows every other product in its price bracket out of the water. That said, I went into this fully knowing I wanted an inexpensive laptop and that, because of that constraint, whatever I ended up purchasing would most likely have some limitations. If you purchased this and are disappointed about the specs in correlation to it being ~$300.... I really don't know what to tell you other than that you definitely were looking in the wrong place. I solely bought this computer because I recently got a CRICUT Explore Air 2 and needed something compatible with it (Chromebooks won't work and my MacBook is so old it can barely handle the newest OS); however, I already know now that this is going to become my main laptop and I will get a lot of use from it outside of just crafting. THE IMPORTANT STUFF: 1.) This is a solidly-built laptop. Very sturdy, very lightweight. Perfect for on-the-go. It IS aluminum though the whole way around, so I recommend buying a case or sleeve to avoid scratching. 2.) The screen resolution and sound quality is surprising very good, crisp, and clean - while I think perhaps it could be a tad bit brighter, that's just me being nit-picky. I would still recommend using external speakers if you want to retain the quality of sound at its loudest setting, especially if what you listen to is bass-heavy. 3.) Turning off Windows S-Mode was absolutely painless - it's literally just going to the website that's taped on the outside of the box and clicking one or two buttons. 4.) Like other reviewers recommended, I did purchase another 8GB of RAM and installed it myself (I googled YouTube videos on how to do this for this specific laptop model; there are plenty of them, just take it slow and you'll be fine). I opted to leave IN the 4GB stick that was already there, thus giving myself a total of 12GB RAM. The difference in speed is HUGE and, like I said, I'm not using this for *too* much other than everyday use. Spend that little bit of extra money if you can, I promise it's worth it! I can't speak to anything as to whether it would hold-up with gaming, but definitely for a solid several hours of streaming content, crafting, and/or having multiple tabs & apps open simultaneously. 5.) The track-pad is VERY sensitive. Not so much so that I would take off a star, but enough to notice. I recommend purchasing a wireless mouse if you plan on doing more intricate work to eliminate any annoyance or mistakes. I bought one (a Logitech one, $10) and so far it's definitely made designing and editing much easier. It's been awhile since I've had a PC but it's nice to know that a lot of its shortcomings (such as memory space & speed) can easily be fixed and modified to your preference. Again, at the end of the day, this is NOT a heavyweight laptop, both literally and figuratively speaking, but that's okay because it's not meant to be! Overall, I would highly recommend this computer to anyone who is looking for an everyday laptop that is both budget-friendly without sacrificing too much of its quality."}, {"name": "M.

The AMD Ryzen 3 3200U CPU packs a good amount of processing in its two cores and two threads per core. When I received my unit, I went through the Windows 10 mini setup.  The system ran fine in the provided Windows 10. I decided to install my operating system of choice which is Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS Desktop 64 bit edition.  In my experience, I found that the Acer Aspire 5 FLIES in Ubuntu or any Linux for that matter in comparison with Windows. Interestingly, I installed VirtualBox so that I could see how the Ryzen 3 3200U would handle virtualization. As it turns out, my Windows 10 virtual machine somehow ran even better than the shipped Windows 10. I also created virtual machines for Elementary OS and the new Linux Mint 19.2 beta. Both those VMs booted in seconds and performed well. If you plan on using virtual machines much with this laptop, I would add memory. The system comes with a single memory stick that is 4GB. There are two memory slots and if you have two matched memory sticks, they would takes advantage of dual channel memory access which might speed the system even more. In my tests, Libre Office writer and calc both launched from scratch in under 4 seconds. I installed both Firefox and Chrome on my Ubuntu and they are both very snappy. I used both the wired Ethernet and also the wireless card which I connected via 802.11ac and it performed very well. The only downside that I found with this system is the touch pad. The touch pad is very large and is impossible to avoid while typing on the keyboard and so I had a lot of typing corrupted by false hits on the touch pad. I finally turned the touch pad off via the Ubuntu mouse control panel and used an external mouse and the problem was solved. This is NOT a gaming machine by any means.

My family purchased 3 and we are all quite happy with them.  It's lightweight, thin and comes packed with the essential features most non-gamers need to work and play.  Plus, it looks great! For the low price, you do give up a few premium features, such as a better CPU, USB-C ports, a large battery and lots of memory and storage.  However, the beautiful 1080p IPS screen, full keyboard layout, spaciousa and responsive touchpad, USB 3.1 ports and stereo speakers easily cover the basics and then some. Plus, memory and hard drive space can be easily upgraded for very little cost, making it possible to match the features of more expensive models without the price tag. The Ryzen 3 processor is plenty fast for most users and the onboard graphics are better than the graphics on Intel's competing i3 and i5 processors.  That said, this laptop does benefit greatly from a small memory upgrade for both speed and graphics performance.  Simply adding a second 4GB stick of DDR4 2400 or 2666 RAM to the free slot inside is all most users will need to get the most out of this laptop. If you plan on gaming heavily, you may want to look elsewhere, as that's not the strength of this particular model.  But, for basic photo/video editing and daily tasks like web browsing, spreadsheets and word processing, the Ryzen cpu with a low-cost 4GB memory upgrade is more than adequate. For users who need more internal storage, Acer has left a slot open inside the laptop which allows a 7mm thick 2.5\" SSD to be added at any time.  With prices falling on SSDs in the 256GB-512GB range, this is a welcome feature and a simple plug-n-play upgrade. Battery life is less than advertised.  Expect around 4 hours of continuous use, compared to the 7+ the manufacturer claims.  I'm assuming the battery can be upgraded to a better one at a later time, since it's easily accessible when the back cover is removed.  However, don't be put off when you find yourself plugging in for a recharge a little sooner than expected.  It's still \"average\" compared to most other laptops. Sound is decent, but not stellar.  Similarly, the trackpad feels a bit \"cheap\" when pressing at the edges, but it works very well and the response is really good overall. All in all, this is a great basic laptop out of the box and just a few dollars put into a couple small upgrades can really go a long way toward maximizing its performance and functionality.

For someone that runs a few light to medium programs, photo/video editing, streaming, school work, etc., this computer has what it takes. Tried Macbooks, which are great, but 2 to 3 times the price of this Acer. Our criteria was we wanted LED backlit HD screen, backlit keyboard, aluminum shell/case, attractive, full Qwerty keyboard with numeric keypad, good battery life, fingerprint reader, ample ports with HDMI, light weight, slim bezel,  and fast. Lastly, it had to be within a budget of under $600. This Acer meets all we wanted. There's nothing wrong with conventional HDD if you know how to take care of your machine. By that I mean, KEEP IT CLEANED! Acer, in its infinite wisdom, pre-installed a utility called ACER CARE CENTER. In this single utility you can defrag, clean out the junk, clean the disk, check health of battery, hard drive, etc. Use it! Some have complained their Acer is slow. Have you cleaned it? Expect to spend the first 3 or 4 hours just getting all the Windows 10 updates installed. After just that, I ran the Acer Care utility to find the hard drive was 28% fragmented, and disk needed to be cleaned. So, defragged and cleaned, then went on to add our many programs. When all done with everything, defragged and cleaned again. It boots up in 15 seconds. Battery life on any laptop is dependent upon the programs and use. Don't expect 10 hours. 5 to 7 hours of word processing, surfing, video/photo editing, and some streaming. Even at current sale price of $349 it's still worth it.

I found this to be a problem straight out of the box setting it up when I couldn't tell what were the capital letters in the password I was putting in!  Secondly, a good bit of the set up involved telling Microsoft exactly how I want them to spy on me, but not giving me any options of not being spied on.  My millenial daughter says people don't care about this any more, but I find it offensive that MS thinks they have the right to know everything I do on my computer and to put ads on it at their whim.  I only get to choose whether I want them personalized or not.  My word. It's none of their business! Thirdly, when I tried to install the program from my job that I bought this computer to use, of course it wouldn't install because of S mode.  When I told it I wanted out of S mode it told me I had to go to the MS Store and buy MS Home for $139!!  My thanks to all the other reviewers who said I could get out of S mode for free.  I finally googled it and MS's own website had the directions I needed.  Note that when I went into settings it was telling me the computer couldn't activate Windows in big red letters.  I had to respond to that first before the \"Switch out of S Mode\" prompts appeared, but I finally did manage to get out of it.

Looking to low end game. Pros: Got it at a great price on Prime Day. Great looking screen for the price. Very thin and lightweight no noticeable difference from my chromebook. Decent computer that upgrades well. Add some ram and it does some decent low end gaming. The NVMe SSD is very quick many of the low end laptops don't have this yet. 2 ram slots for dual channel many low ends only have 1. Cons: Ram runs at 2400 not 2666 don't believe the Acer reps here I have tested it myself with multiple sticks including the one that came with the laptop. Needs more ram for what I needed. If you just want to browse the internet and watch streams its ok. Keyboard back lighting looks bad some keys are much brighter then others I bothers me. No easy way to get to the ram battery or drives. Small SSD but I get what I pay for My goals are to be able to play some Classic World of Warcraft. Not raiding but auction house professions and a easy quest or two during down time at work. I must also be able to tab out quickly to my work spreadsheets and pricing sites. I know for sure the amount of ram would not do for what I wanted and would need to be upgraded and I had included this into my pricing thoughts. I went with 16gb ddr4 2666 cl15 for about $73. A little overkill but 8gb would be pushing it with all my work stuff needing to be open and ready at anytime and 2gb being reserved for graphics.  Being a Ryzen and integrated graphics it gets good use of the higher quality ram 2666 (15cl vs 18 or 19cl) so I splurged a extra $10 for. stock ram included was listed at 19cl for anyone that cares. I know classic wow is not a intense game but its really hard to find out how bad a laptop you can get and have it run bare minimum settings. I was looking at the E5-576G-5762 for about $599 and I would still want to up the ram in that but looking to save some money on a laptop I would only use twice a week really I decided to give this a try after much research. So for Team Fight Tactics I am getting 60 to 100 fps late game full teams can bring it down but its stays over 90 for the most part. Classic WoW I am currently playing with 1080p settings 3 (the classic like setting) getting from 60 to 120 fps while I can't test a raid yet I have only been able to use this for the stress test. moving up to settings 4 lowers the fps to 40 to 70 range. I am currently at 80% used of the SSD with only wow, classic wow, league of legends and a benchmark app installed. I would probably install a few more games just to test out but no space for now. Guess that will need upgraded at some point but honestly other then discord I don't plan to have anything else on here.

It can play any \"last gen\" game - so Rocket League, Skyrim, Minecraft - at high settings 60fps nbd and generally anything that's been ported to mobile (Fortnite) will run at 60fps at low settings. I will say this again: Your performance will be LITERALLY cut in half without that $14 stick of RAM. Just get the stupid thing. Don't be a dipstick. Don't believe me? Look up the benchmarks for this laptop. The CPU cores communicate over the RAM and so do the APU cores. Slowing down traffic by half also slows down *EVERYTHING* by half because it's going to be the bottleneck once performance otherwise maxes out - and with 2 cores it will max out quickly with games. That said, the desktop isn't dead. If you're looking to run games primarily - or you at least know that that's something you want to do - and those games aren't last gen - I'd strongly recommend building a PC. Using PCPartPicker or just posting a thread on Reddit you can have your PC parts purchased pretty quickly and building - even if you're illiterate - will take about 2 hours tops.

Converting from Windows S mode to Home is also very easy. If you decide to order a second hard drive to upgrade it, be aware that you MUST order a drive that is 7mm thick. I originally ordered a 1 TB mechanical drive to install, based on an Amazon recommendation, and it was a 9.5mm drive. On the Acer website it clearly indicates that this laptop only supports 7mm secondary drives. I ended up installing a 7mm SSD and an additional 4GB of ram, and now it's blazing fast.

However, due to terrible support and shady practices, it's been wildly cheapened by Acer. 1. Acer installed their own adware on my device without my knowledge or consent.  Worse, they created unchangeable notification settings, buried the installation files in a hidden directory, abused the character limit to hide it from the program removal tool; either hid it from the registry with deceptive location and naming, or used a scheduled executable and won't provide the information necessary to determine whether simply deleting the files is safe. 2. People who have deleted the files are reporting either a failure to completely remove [meaning the files bounced back] or breaks caused by the removal of the files.  These breaks include loss of data, boot looping, massive decrease in system performance, and registry errors. 3. Acer has provided no tool for removing their bloatware.  One must blindly trust a third party tool for the \"safe\" removal of the software. 4. The tech support doesn't know how to remove the software, instead redirecting me to other resources that either don't address this specific issue directly or don't provide a solution.  Windows cannot detect and remove software that has a name longer than 60 characters in the registry.  The removal must be performed through the registry.  Because the identify of these files in the registry is not published, it would take hours - days to find and remove the software via the registry.  This method could result in the aforementioned breaks, especially if done incorrectly.  For example, an accidental removal of a vital system file could occur. 5.

After the last automatic system update from last month (March 25, 2020), I took advantage of my Windows Pro privileges, looked up the proper way to disable automatic system updates, and then promptly did so [this cannot be done through normal Windows system settings without setting up a metered connection, which I'm unable to do because I telecommute for work and it would interfere with the systems in place with my employer]. The hardware is EXCELLENT for the price, however, the experience with Acer is a NIGHTMARE.  I won't suggest missing this device.  Buy it, buy and install Windows 10 Pro, find out how to turn off automatic system updates via the Group Policy Editor, disable automatic updates there and in system settings [to be safe] AS SOON AS it this laptop boots for the first time, buy and install your [secondary] 2.5 inch SSD / HDD / hybrid drive, and buy and install your RAM upgrades [up to 32 GB supported].  If you do that, you'll have a wonderful experience with this device.  If you make the mistake of trusting Acer not to compromise your system through updates after you purchase, you'll have a pretty bad experience trying to fix what they sneakily do to it.  Once you're loaded with dozens of GB of data, it's not nearly so easy to just start over. This rating is justified by this company policy.  The company did this to my laptop.  Before they did that, I would have rated it five stars."}, {"name": "L.

Also i have hooked this up to my Sony TV set for netflix and youtube via HDMI cable.  i had experienced sound dropping from the TV - that is i can see the video but no sound was coming out from my TV set.  I pulled the HDMI and rebooted and it seemed to do the trick. Sometimes there's appears to be a lag or it stutters watching netflix and sometimes there is none.. i think that is because the cable company is prob throttling the download/upload speeds. they tell you a big number on the speed but they don't guarantee that speed 24/7. I'm usually not a fan of AMD processors - but it's pretty good but i'm not gaming or doing any heavy processing at all. The screen is not touch screen but not a big deal - the screen's colors look great.  The battery i think i got about 6 hours on a full charge. This computer comes with an empty hard drive bay and there's another expansion slot for RAM.  In the near future i will put in a either a 1TB or 2TB SSD harddrive and prob upgrade the RAM on this thing. I have had this laptop for a week so far no real cons to it.

Normally, you have to hold \"Fn\" and hit an F key to use the function, but it was reversed on this machine. Also, the keyboard backlight turned itself off after 20 seconds of inactivity whether or not it was plugged in. It kind of defeats the purpose of a backlit keyboard, in my opinion, when you can't see the keys before you start typing. At any rate, both the F key and backlight issues were mostly fixed when I updated the BIOS directly from the Acer support site. I was then able to find settings for both in BIOS and disable automatic function key and backlight timeout. My only gripe is that there doesn't seem to be any way to keep the backlight on for more than 20 seconds when unplugged, no matter the power settings or BIOS configuration. Lots of Googling and worthless Acer chat support sessions later, I'm convinced there's no workaround. That issue aside, I can't really say anything else negative about this machine. At this price point, this is about as good as it gets. If you plan on doing anything other than browsing the internet and using Office, I do recommend purchasing an additional 4GB RAM stick and installing it yourself. It took me maybe 5 minutes with a YouTube tutorial video. Between that extra RAM and the stock SSD, I can run low-end games with Chrome and Skype running in the background all at once with no slowdown whatsoever.

There is probably an even newer bios in there. After updating the BIOS, and using distros with newer Kernels, I've successfully ran Fedora, Manjaro, and Solus. Currently Manjaro works the best with fewer bugs and is the distro I prefer. The battery life seems like it could be better, but it isn't horrible. I'm still messing with screen brightness settings to see if that makes a difference. I'll update this if it becomes a five star product. So, you want to install Linux? You probably won't be able to enable Legacy Boot, so discard that option if youtube and google told you to try that, unless your BIOS is somehow different from mine. You will need to: 1) Google how to make a bootable USB compatible with UEFI, then get your Linux ISO burned onto the USB. 2) Turn on your Acer and hit F2 right after the first splash screen to access the BIOS options 3) Setup a Supervisor Password (If you want it blank, I think it can be blank. Or make it something easy to remember and go back and change it to an empty field.) 4) Step 3 allows you to turn off Secure Boot. Look for it in the menus and do it. 5) Enable F12 boot menu (this allows you to select a USB to boot from). This is also in the menus. 6) Save changes and restart 7) Insert USB with bootable ISO 8) Restart, 9) hit F12 right after first splash screen, and you will have an option to select your USB to boot from. 10) Enjoy Linux. You can install, partition, or do whatever. I got Solus Linux running on it. Had some problems getting the latest Manjaro ISOs to fully boot. What you do from there is all up to you. I completely wiped Windows without ever booting into it once. If you are writing a review and you tried Linux, please put something about which Distro and steps you took and any problems you encountered, this helps all folks who want a better OS.

Great value for money. If you're willing to deal with regular problems and that cheap pricepoint is all you're looking for, this is a good option. Pros: Backlit keys regularly turn off to save battery. Haven't found a setting to adjust this, but there's that. All keys have good travel, with a quiet clickiness. Quick activation, but they're thin enough that you won't notice it. Numpad is kinda small but it's also backlit and the layout isn't bad. Dysfunctional touchapad is big. 1080p. It's cheap, got this for $320. Cons: I'll list the cons from design flaws to potential model defects. First and most noticable is the misaligned trackpad, with it starting at the middle of the left alt key and ending at the spacebar. Not a major problem but it's left me often checking my thumbs. Right alt key is much smaller than the left. Webcam is pretty bad, so if you want to use it, you would be better off facetime or google hangouts. ok here's the glitches I've noticed as of opening up the laptop less than 6 hours ago. All keys are sticky and don't always activate. G and B have given me the most problems. I have to press hard to make them activate. The trackpad only works on the right side of the trackpad. There is no left clicking. Chrome is slow and glitchy, reminding me of pixel slate, not crashing but taking several seconds to scroll down or anything basic. The \"brightness down\" and \"brightness up\" buttons are reversed. Volume isn't though. Back to the touchpad because it's causing more problems!

Lets start off with what I like about this laptop. Keep in mind this is weighted by the low price point: - The display is solid, especially at this price point. Every other laptop in this range has a crappy old TN display. This is the real party piece of this laptop. - The aluminum top shell looks nice. - Processor seems adequate, or dare I say it, almost speedy - The SSD also performs well, even if it is on the small side. My wife doesn't store much on her laptop, so this is a non-issue for me. - Battery life is solid. 4 hours of continuous, medium duty use with no issues and 6-8 hours with lighter workloads. - Easy to upgrade. The RAM upgrade was a breeze, and there's even space inside for a 2.5\" SATA drive should you want to go that route instead of NVMe to upgrade storage. If you own an #1 Philips screwdriver and can remember righty-tighty lefty-loosey you should be good to go. This laptop isn't perfect (non of them are), so here's what I'm not crazy about: - The main body of the laptop isn't aluminum, it's plastic. This wouldn't be a big deal except for the fact that the plastic feels cheap. Really cheap. I'd go so far as to say flimsy. This doesn't inspire confidence that it will hold up for the long run, but so far so good. - Ditto on the track pad. It's worse than the track pad from the Chromebook this laptop replaced. - It's very hard to get the connector from the power adapter seated into the charging port. It almost feels like you are going to break something. It's gotten a little better with time though. Well, there it is. A decent performing laptop with questionable build quality. At this price point, that's kind of what I expected. Time will tell how it holds up, but so far, so good. If you have any illusions that this is going to be a budget gaming laptop, let me stop you right there.

When coding, you frequently have to move the mouse to highlight specific pieces of text to do some sort of edit in your code. Unfortunately, the mousepad on this laptop is not accurate or precise, and when trying to make fine movements with the mousepad, the mouse moves in very, very small skips instead of a smooth, consistent glide. This makes it impossible to move the mouse quickly and precisely, because when trying to execute precise movements, you have to slow down and course correct several times when you get the mouse close to where you want it to go (instead of being able to quickly move the mouse to the precise location you intend). This lack of precision is very frustrating, and makes the user experience so slow that I am going to return it. I purchase laptops for at least 2 years of consistent use, and I just don't want to endure that kind of frustration every single day as I'm trying to give all of my attention towards building a technical skill.

I could not find a solution to this issue after scouring the internet and trying a bunch of different fixes for about 4 or 5 hours. Some linux distributions have small issues with certain laptops, so for whatever reason Ubuntu 18.04 and this laptop just did not work well together. This issue was also frustrating and made for a very diminished user experience, although I may have been able to find another distribution that would have worked with this laptop.

From start to finish, including updates, was less than 30 minutes.  Super quick boot time <10 sec to log in screen. You will want to update the graphics driver via device manager. The rest of the drivers were up to date. Sound quality was a concern. I went into the Realtek manager and switched from music mode to game mode and it made a big difference in the volume for me. Your mileage may vary. If you prop the front of the laptop up slightly, not covering the speakers, the quality improves also.

There are work-arounds and dual booting and dealing with developer mode.  When a recent cheap Chromebook died, I looked for a replacement, but either the work arounds were really slow, or the Chromebooks recommended specifically for that purpose were super expensive.  Then I came across this (again, it is not a chromebook), and figured I'd just install Linux on it and use it for web browsing and connecting to various services on my home network. It worked flawlessly.  The supplied SSD Hard Drive is somewhat small (plenty of room if you do most of your work in the cloud though), but they do supply a mounting kit and if you need it a YouTube video for how to install a larger drive in the computer.  One slightly disappointing thing is that I had a few 1 TB SSDs sitting around, and the plan was to toss one in the laptop and reclaim the 128 GB SSD to use in an enclosure as a USB drive to transfer files/hold a dev env between work and home and support for various friends.  The included 128GB drive is just the chip on a board and doesn't look easily removable, and wouldn't mount in any of my enclosures even if I could remove it.  So, adding a large disk just adds another drive in the OS, it doesn't replace the one it comes with. That actually isn't a big deal as it saved me the hassle of virtualizing the included Windows 10 installation to run on a VM if I ever needed Windows.  After a few false starts where it didn't look like you could boot off of anything but the included SSD (turns out, disabling FastStart in the BIOS lets it book off of a USB key), I was able to verify everything worked fine off a live CD image on USB and it can now just dual boot into windows or linux seamlessly. The memory is a bit tight, and while I was getting everything installed and configured I'd get random pauses.  Adding an 8GB memory stick (easily accessible, especially if you are upgrading the drive and have the cover off already - it just has 10 normal phillips screws, no special tools required) solved that, although I did spend a few days just surfing the web on the laptop and using remote ssh into the home network, and after the initial installation and configuration I rarely saw any problems  while waiting for the memory to arrive. So, for about $22 extra dollars for the RAM, I now have a pretty speedy computer with a nice display, full number pad to the right of the keyboard, much more capable than the Chromebook it replaced for about the same price.  My original plan was to just use it as a web browser and an ssh client into my desktop to do development work on the couch, but it turns out my dev tool chain works perfectly fine on the laptop.  It is slightly slower doing a full compile of projects than the desktop, but that is to be expected, and I don't get any network lags doing thing remotely.  I don't really notice any difference while actually coding or doing small write/compile/test cycles. The only real negative for me so far is that for a new laptop (the manufacture date on the sticker says Oct 2019, but it has to have been designed before that), it still has a specialized charger.  I've got much older laptops that use USB-C charging.  So, that is one more cable on the desktop, one more adapter to move from room to room, one more specialized piece of equipment that will need to be replaced if it goes bad. But, for the price, it isn't a speed demon, but I don't play games except on consoles and with very minor upgrades it works as well as any other PC laptop I've used.  I'm not a Windows guy, but I did use it long enough to switch it from Windows 10 Home S which comes pre-installed to Windows 10 Home (the main difference being you aren't tied to the MS store for application installation , as far as I can tell).  I did install some software and used it and it felt as snappy as any of my work laptops (although, that could be damning with faint praise)."}, {"name": "lina", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2019", "title": "Do not buy a Macbook for school/college.

Design: 10/10 For starters, this is very similar (if not better) to the appearance of a macbook and seems really light and durable. You can easily fit it in your bag and everything about it screams quality despite how low of a price you're paying for this. I can't for the life of me understand why someone would spend an extra 700 dollars for a mac, but that's just me personally. Performance/Battery life: 10/10 The specs aren't the best obviously, but it gets the job done and you get more than what you've even envisioned this machine doing. It's lighting fast with little to no problems this far, if you're using it for everyday use such as writing assignments, watching the occasional (frequent) youtube/netflix videos, you'll be pleasantly surprised at how smoothly it handles these basic tasks. In terms of gaming, I doubt I'm gonna use it for that as i already got a gaming setup. Battery life averages between 5-7 hours depending on how you're utilizing the machine. Audio: 8/10 It isn't the loudest, the audio is fine but if there is an AC blasting or a fan, you're gonna have a hard time listening to this. It does get the job done however, and using headphones never hurt anyone. Keyboard and lighting and display: 10/10 The keyboard is very ez on the fingers and the lighting also ez on the eyes. It'll take you mere minutes to adjust to how easy it is to type on this keyboard and it is extremely quiet, unlike some other laptop keyboards. The display here is the true winner, I thought to myself there is absolutely no way you're getting true HD at this price point, man o man am I glad I was wrong.

If you are undecided between the i3 or Ryzen chip, the extra $40ish dollars would be better spent on RAM or an internal hard drive.  The i3 might be a little better, but it won't be noticable.  The Ryzen with extra RAM will probably perform better than the i3 anyway. As far as Win 10 in S mode, I am happy that it is set up this way.  There was little to no bloatware on the laptop, and the apps you do not want/need are much easier to delete than removing programs.

At minimum the memory should be upgraded to really make this a great machine, the cheapest upgrade is a single 4GB DDR4-2400 memory stick that would double the memory and enable dial channel operation for a nice performance boost. It works great with Linux as long as you stick with the latest kernels, the stock Debian/buster 4.19 kernel had some issues, but it works perfectly with the 5.2 kernel. Despite being a slim lightweight laptop with a large and bright screen, it is very easy to replace the memory and hard drive, unlike many recent premium laptops that are glued shut with non-removable components. The back cover can be easily removed to gain access to the memory and ssd. It comes with a 128GB NVMe x2 M.2 2280 WD SN520 SSD, that can be replaced with any 2280 NVMe ssd. Be aware though that only 2 PCIe lanes are connected, so any x4 ssd will run in x2 mode, limiting the bandwidth, but it's still much faster than SATA based SSDs. There are 2 DDR4 SODIMM slots, one occupied by the 4GB stick that comes with the machine, but can be removed to install a bigger stick. The processor supports DDR4-2400 speeds. I have installed 2x8GB memory, and based on the measured memory bandwidth I can confirm that it operates in dual-channel mode. The machine also has an empty slot for a 2.5\" drive, which is useful for those that need lots of cheap storage on board, but using that would reduce battery life. The processor is pretty fast, on par with Intel Core i3 netbooks, and the integrated  Radeon graphics easily beats the integrated graphics in Intel chips, especially with the upgraded dual channel memory, but obviously this is not a gaming laptop. Pros: Great price, upgradable memory (32GB should work), upgradable 2280 NVMe SSD, empty 2.5\" HDD slot, beautiful screen, gigabit RJ45 port, lightweight Cons: not so great battery life, no SD card reader, no USB-C port, cheap speakers, air intake at the bottom"}, {"name": "Stormy0440", "rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2019", "title": "Watch out for Windows 10-\"S\"", "review_text": "This has Windows 10-S & I hate it.

The keyboard is magnificent, the position of the keys is just what you need, the noise it makes when you type it is not annoying, it has lighting which helps you a lot when using it in low light, it is programmed to turn off if you do not use it  which is good if you are watching a movie, reading or watching videos on YouTube.  The screen is very good, to be honest I was very surprised, its quality is quite clear the colors are not appreciated false or over saturated, the image quality it offers is something that will fascinate you outdoors because you have to look for a good angle of that  shape will not be affected, the brightness is decent if you want to lower it to a minimum and when you choose to upload it to the maximum you will appreciate the clear images without perceiving that feeling of discomfort.

I consider it a laptop for normal day-to-day use, to perform tasks in Excel, to do documents, to browse the web, are things that make them very easily the solid state disk (128 SSD) allows you to open programs with  very easily, even with the basic specifications you will have a very good performance and speed, I have installed Autocad 3D which is the program that I normally have installed on my MacBook Pro and it turns out that it runs without any complications.

Although the box the laptop (inside) was packed in was good, it could have easily been broken. The laptop is a great size and screen visibility is great.  It has a touch pad, but the screen is not touch. It also has a full numeric keypad and lighted keys - both good options. It comes as an \"S\" version.  What that means is that you cannot load programs - you have to download applications from Microsoft (which are limited.)  So you can put on the MS Office Suite, use it for e-mails, surf the Internet and save any documents.  What you can't do is load programs like Quicken, etc.  The version on which you can load programs is the \"Home\" version.  See the comments above.  You can switch this over to a \"Home\" version with no cost, but that decision cannot be reversed.

I also don't need a a lot of storage as I save to the cloud and don't play video games or use anything else which requires a huge amount of storage.

Aluminum cover ...  classy look.  No bloatware.  I have owned many PCs, I don't think I have ever liked one better.  After one week I could not be happier.  Top rated budget laptop.

I have not played any games on it. The laptop turns on fast and the overall speed is good. The picture quality is very excellent. Now the keyboard was a little turn off. The keys feel like they will brake and they are small. Most of the time the laptop fans are fine and quite. But once in a while it starts working hard and it gets loud. The USB slots are a little tight. It doesn't go in smoothly and go out smoothly. I wouldn't recommend putting the computer on a blanked or something of sort. Only on something hard. Otherwise for my intended purpose it was worth the price. As for the Windows S mode if you go into the windows store there is a free app that let's you switch out of it. You need a windows account to download and install it. Edit: I tried turning off the maximum memory option which limits the memory but it didn't work. I tried putting in only 1 stick of memory in one of the slots and vise versa but it didn't work. So no problem with the memory cards.

For the money and overall affordability of this machine, it actually is quite impressive.  I've only had it for one night, but I had a couple hours to mess around with it.  I purchased this for light purpose use.  Word documents, spreadsheets and maybe some light media, but not serious gaming or for photos and videos.  Despite this, the HD is really clear and crisp.  It's not 4k, but the 1080P is definitely nice to look at from any angle. Any true gamer or serious gamer will already know by looking at the SPECS that this is not a machine built for serious gaming.  Good luck trying to find a high quality PC for gaming under $800.00.  With that said, if you are thinking you can play a bunch of high end games on this unit, my advice to you is \"not to buy this unit for gaming or heavy downloading\".  This machine is perfect for quick movement through Office applications, streaming video and for using WiFi and it also has enough memory built in to function reliably, but also to save a fair amount of pictures or music downloads. The only thing I wish it would have on the mouse area of the keyboard is the \"quick slider\".  This missing feature didn't reduce the rating for me at all, as I use a wireless optical mouse anyway via USB.  The quick scrolling feature that is generally found on the right side of the mouse area is nice to have when browsing the web if you don't have a wireless mouse unit.  The backlit keyboard makes up for the missing quick scroll feature though.  Like I said, this machine is a very good deal for your money.

I'm not sure why this laptop appears as part of a search for touch screen, and why it's listed as an option to be rated. Things I like: - Start up is fast. Turns on and off with ease. Cheap. - Fairly light, big screen. Keyboard is great. Backlit keyboard. - Battery life seems ok. About 3-4 hours so far without needing to charge. Things I don't like: - The volume is horrendous. My phone plays music and shows louder than this computer. Use headphones/earphones or plug-in speakers. Has a bit of a muffled quality with the speakers being on the bottom of the laptop (at the two corners of the laptop). - Backlit keyboard doesn't stay on likely to save energy, but I prefer the keyboard to stay on. I haven't been able to find an option to change this setting. - Camera quality is terrible. It's so pixelized it reminds me of a computer I had in the early 2000's. Don't get this laptop if you plan on having video calls or anything to do with video. - The touchpad is doing something odd where it'll minimize my browser and I'll have to re-open the browser when I'm scrolling or using the touchpad. I've looked at every possible setting. - Tried to edit some docs and it started highlighting things on its own. - Hinged laptop: Every computer I've had in the past where the screen is hinged has over time broken off, became loose, or doesn't work properly. There is no fingerprint reader. There was a review that mentioned this, but I don't have this option. This computer is touted as lightning fast, but it lags if I have more than 2 tabs open. The microphone occasionally fails, oddly where if you test the microphone it works, but if you use anything requiring the microphone you get an error message. I've had to reboot this thing twice now. I needed a computer in a pinch for general browsing, but I would honestly pay a bit more for better quality.

This laptop looks and feels premium! The lid is aluminum and the body is polycarbonate. The frame is very study with little to no flex. Upgrade the RAM! Get at least a second 4gb stick of RAM to benefit from duel channel bandwidth. This translated into about 2x the fps in gaming. Although this is a productivity, you can run games surprisingly well on it! I was able to get 60fps on many different games, gta5 will see 35-45fps on low settings, killing floor 2 saw 50-60fps on low settings, paladins saw a pretty consistent 60fps 1080p low / medium settings, Warframe saw 40-50fps with the right combination of gfx settings. I edited and rendered this video using this machine and it was a great experience. The IPS display looks great but could stand to get a little brighter. Using it indoors should be fine and at night I find it to be plenty bright and end up lowering the brightness. The backlight keyboard looks fantastic, no brightness settings so they can be toggled on or off. The keyboard feels great, makes you want to type things for no reason. The track pad is large and feels pretty nice, not as nice as a MacBook but pretty darn good. The track pad can be toggled on and off. You get enough USB ports, 2x USB 2 and one USB 3.1. I transferred files from a SSD through the USB 3.1 port and hit rates over 500MB/s which made me happy. Transferring large video files from my camera is virtually instantaneous. I'm happy they put in USB port on the right side which I use for my wireless mouse. I've had issues with my MacBook connecting with my worked mouse because there is no USB port on the right side and the aluminum body often times interfered with the connection to the mouse. The speakers get loud enough for me but don't expect to be blown away by them - it is after a laptop and generally I have my headphones on anyhow.. I upgraded the ram to 16gb and added a 1tb SSD and was out the door for $450. You really can't get a laptop specked like that for $450 - totally happy with this product.

Everything was flawless for the first two weeks or so.  Then a Windows 10 update came in and it all went downhill very quickly.  I won't bore you with all the specific details but it got to the point where the machine would not even boot.  I want to emphasize that these problems were software NOT hardware related.  The machine itself was great. Long story short, I contacted Acer and they gave me a no hassle return process.  I just sent if back yesterday for them to repair/replace/whatever.  Good thing I do not need it right away. I learned through all the repair efforts that switching from 10s to regular home puts it in the 32 bit version of 10 and when 64 bit updates come in, problems can ensue and it seems to be the case for me.  If it comes back with the 10s version, I will probably wipe the drive and install a fresh 64 bit version of Windows 10 and wait until Gates and company can create some new version of pain to inflict upon us.

The Toshiba one was starting to show its age by failing to pass POST and thus failing to boot. I had used it almost every single day since 2012 after all, as it was my college laptop and even helped me launch my career as an engineer, so it has served me well. But the OS failures were getting troublesome. They were happening increasingly often, so I decided before all my data was lost (which wasn't really that much, since I keep all my actually important data on a home file server), I decided to shop around for a nice, reliable, not-too-cheap laptop I could use to replace it, and this is the one I chose to buy. For the non-Linux enthusiasts, feel free to skip this paragraph, but a kernel panic is basically the Windows blue screen of death equivalent on Linux. My old Toshiba was having kernel panics all the time starting with Kernel 5, so I thought maybe it was my old hardware which has having trouble with the brand new kernel. I tried an LTS version of Kernel 4.19, thinking it was going to solve my kernel panic issue, but nope. I still had kernel panics all the time, and it was starting to get worrying how often it was happening (multiple times a day near the time I got this new Acer laptop). So I feel like I got the new Acer laptop just in time before the Toshiba hardware became unbootable. Now, I'm an electrical engineer, but I'm a lazy engineer. I didn't feel like dissecting the Toshiba to try and pinpoint what the problem might have been. I use Arch btw (best meme 2k19) So back to regular English. I'm thoroughly impressed with the hardware that AMD has developed with their Ryzen lineup and their Vega graphics. Sadly, with all the cryptocurrency mining happening nowadays, it's actually hard to find any AMD graphics card for use with actual graphics workloads like gaming. But that's beside the point. This Acer laptop, with its Ryzen 3 processor and built-in Vega Picasso graphics is almost overkill for what I use it for. I haven't tested any games on it, but I imagine it would run Minecraft well enough. Maybe not 60fps, but still enough to play. I use this laptop mainly for just web browsing, and occasional coding when I'm feeling ambitious with some sort of personal software project I want to work on. In the time that I used Windows 10 S Mode... it was just plain dumb. Not being able to install software from non-Microsoft sources? Really, Microsoft? What are you doing? You can easily opt out of the S Mode crap, but it warns you that you'll never be able to go back to S Mode in the future if you ever change your mind. Like that'll scare me into keeping S Mode! I'll show you how much I care about S Mode. I only spent about a half hour tinkering with it before I just blasted the whole NVMe M.2 drive clean and installed good old Arch Linux on it with a fully encrypted filesystem, so ain't nobody getting into my data. And I can say, this NVMe M.2 drive is freaking lightning quick. Compared to the old HDD on my Toshiba, this new laptop boots in like 15 seconds, if even that. My main PC with Godly specs (Intel i9-9900K + RTX2080Super + 1TB Samsung NVMe M.2) boots in around 10 seconds, so this little laptop is definitely keeping up with the speed. Overall, this Acer laptop is a fantastic computer; probably the best laptop I've ever owned at this price point. It's perfect for basic usage, and I recommend it to be used for light workloads like checking email, browsing social media, editing office documents, coding, and other basic tasks of the sort. The Ryzen + Vega chip will definitely last several years, and I'm happy to finally support a quality AMD product. Ultimately, it's up to you as the customer to decide if this is the right computer for your needs. Evaluate why you need this computer and determine whether or not the price of this laptop would best suit your needs. I needed something I could rely on with streaming, decoding, and rendering video data from YouTube, Twitch, and/or Netflix which is actually a bigger task than people give it credit for. If you don't intend to watch many videos or do anything more resource-intensive than that, then this laptop might be a touch too powerful for your needs. With all that in mind, it's safe for me to say that this Acer laptop is perfect for the moderately light workloads I intend to use it for."}, {"name": "Joseph Niles", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2019", "title": "Windows operating system is \u201cnon-genuine\u201d.", "review_text": "Windows is in S mode, cannot download anything.

Same sleek design, very good screen, same materials and build quality, and all the latest tech inside along with Windows 10 Home once you switch out of S Mode. If your laptop is four or five years old like my old one you're in for a treat. Everything about this one is better than my old. It's lighter, quieter, sleeker, runs cooler, and the screen is leaps and bounds better. The keyboard feels quality, back lit, and you won't disturb anyone while typing as its very quiet in use. No more clacking! Cons? The screen could get 20% brighter. The volume could be louder from the speakers and varies in loudness from app to app at 100%. No optical drive if you're used to having one, but inexpensive external drives are easily found. No finger print reader or USB-C port as found on the more expensive models of this unit. But as said if you want or need more, pay more. Thanks to the AMD graphics you can do light to moderate gaming with this if you upgrade the RAM to at least 8gb. Quick, easy, and cheap to do. You'll need to adjust settings down, also. Sometimes dramatically. But you can play some games. Less demanding and older ones with no trouble, and on higher settings. I would recommend upgrading RAM to 8gb or more, and storage as well if need be. This isn't a matter of shortcomings with the unit, just a matter of you get what you pay for out of the box. Which is enough for a lot of us. Heck if you use your computer like many to browse the web, social media, stream videos, store photos, online shopping, modest multi tasking, and for school, work, and organization, you may not upgrade at all. I've been using it out of the box for those purposes for three days and have no slowdowns, hiccups, or crashes. It just operates smoothly, quietly, speedily, and looks good doing it. Oh, and boot up time is non existent. This thing is up and running as fast as my phones. I got mine on Cyber Monday and saved $30. But had I paid more I'd be just as happy.

Decent viewing angles, but it's not the brightest screen, I'd say about 300 lumens or so. Usable during the day, even with some sunlight, and it won't burn your eyes at night if you accidentally leave the brightness all the way up, it's in a good spot The NvMe drive is plenty fast for booting up and launching programs, but at 128GBs, you'll want to add a 1TB Hard Drive for around $40 if you need to store more than just a few documents and not too many programs. This laptop can do some light gaming, plays light games like Cuphead at 60fps on battery or plugged in. Portal 2 over 100fps when plugged in, and it's GREAT to stream games through Steam if you already have a gaming desktop and a good Internet connection. Otherwise, don't expect to run AAA titles like Call of Duty or Apex Legends with this, it's more for indie titles or small games Battery usually lasts me around 5 hours or more, with the brightness usually turned up a bit, so I can watch YouTube, Netflix, etc. or listen to music and do homework for a while. I usually don't use speakers to watch or listen to stuff, but they can be decently loud, I like that it has a headphone jack and Bluetooth so I can use any type of headphones Trackpad is okay, feels nice and has some good gestures. It supposedly uses Windows Precision Drivers, but I'm not too sure. Sometimes while typing my palm will move the trackpad so it jitters in the spot, which is a bit annoying but easily ignored The one con about this laptop is that the backlight for the keyboard turns off basically 5 seconds after you don't touch the keyboard. It's nice for saving battery, but if you're using it where it's dark, you'll have to hit some random key so you have light to hit the key you want to. I haven't found a way to change this setting or even the brightness of the backlight, so take that as you will Overall, 4/5.

I wasn't expecting much but I installed Counterstrike Source and did a quick test and it gets over 100fps in 1080p. I did not try any new games but just the fact it can play even older 3d games alone is a nice bonus to me. I've ordered the 4gb extra ddr to get a performance boost, that should be the first thing done to this laptop, after turning off windows S mode and uninstalling bloatware. I installed an old 250gb SSD into the empty bay. Wow that \"cable\" is tiny and thin but it works.  Also they don't provide tiny screws to mount that SSD,so I just ended up taping mine in..but it worked fine. You will quickly run out of storage if you do not add another sata SSD or replace the NVMe ssd. Speakers do kind of suck. Volume is too low. I almost feel as though I could probably upgrade them myself if I really wanted to, though haven't tried yet. For whatever reason, as someone else pointed out, the function keys are enabled by default, and not the standard F1-F12 functions. Really stupid is F1 is mapped to \"sleep\" so if you accidentally hit F1 when trying to hit ESC, your laptop shuts down...extremely annoying! I disabled that in software in Windows settings. But I will try to update the BIOS as well. Also if you use this on your lap (imagine that) or your chest while in bed for any length of time, it will get hot. To avoid this, I purchased a laptop cooler which is just basically a plastic tray that allows air to vent through the sides. PC does boot up very fast though. Also as other posters have pointed out, you actually CAN use this laptop for gaming for the latest games, if you use Steam streaming and have a gaming desktop pc. That feature works incredibly well, and I've been able to play some of the newest games on this thing using streaming. So overall still happy with the laptop after a month of use.

For those that can allow the upgrade of a 16gb sodimm ddr4 RAM I suggest you do it.  The result is a modern, well designed piece of computing.  It runs emulators with ease on games you already own.  It does video editing and music editing very well. As far as processor goes its slightly better than an i3.  Graphics are better than your typical integrated but not by much.

As it eliminates sooo much BS! no interruptions or buffering or stuttering or whatever! it just works right & keeps working:) Yes this laptop has all the plug ins you could want, it really is a well designed & set up machine..... I bought this as a gift.... but now I like it so much I am regretting not getting one for myself, doh! Set up was a 5 minute breeze.... I have gotten really good at 1st time set ups over the years :) And.... this thing functions fast & flawless and looks great doing it... the screen is big bright & beautiful! Sound - Well, it's about on par with most laptops - which is just \"OK\" \u2026. nothing a set of speakers won't fix. IMO if you are sitting on that \"not sure yet\" fence.... jump off of it quickly before the price goes up again! Yes, this is a Laptop that you can love,, as there hasn't been a single uh oh, or Oh No! moment..... nothing but good times!

I didn't have high hopes based on the price. It seemed to fit my work needs though, which was what I primarily needed it for, and it wasn't going to cost a thousand dollars. I used it for a total of three months and really don't have any significant complaints. Sure it's a little slower than more expensive models, it doesn't have a bunch of bells and whistles, and it has a cheaper, plastic feel to it. I didn't even bother trying to play any games on it (though it seems like it could handle some). I did run a series of work programs on it simultaneously almost daily though, for multiple hours at a time. I played some videos on it from time to time, sometimes while other programs were running and/or while browsing the internet. You could hear the fan running more frequently than other models as it was probably overworked a bit, but it got everything done. The only general complaint I might have is how absolutely overloaded it is with nonsense programs, trying to get you to sign into everything, default settings with questionable privacy, etc., but that's really any electronic these days. You're obviously not going to get some superior quality computer in this price range, but for a few hundred dollars, it's worth it and it does what you need it to do.

Hughes", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2017", "title": "Sort of ruggedized, sort of kindergartenized", "review_text": "I've been a Chromebook fan since 2015. Many people writing reviews on Amazon about their frustrations with certain Chromebooks are almost entirely confused about-- or unfamiliar with-- the OS, so they take it out on the machine. That's not fair or accurate. By way of background, I also need to explain that I bought a pair of ASUS C100PA-DB02 10.1-inch Chromebook flips with touchscreens back in 2015. They have very glossy/shiny screens which glare, but the touch screen feature is nice. They also feature an actual aluminum metal chassis which is very elegant and classy looking (although prone to scratches). I saw this \"ruggedized\" version of a Chromebook on Amazon and thought I'd pick one up. I'm already an Asus fan, I like the Chromebook OS, and I was looking for a more durable Chromebook to literally throw in my backpack or briefcase and head out the door-- without worrying about a sleeve, case, or possible scratches if none of these was used. Well, this \"ruggedized\" version looks like it'd be great for children. Not so great for professional adults who've been spoiled with the nicer Chromebooks or laptops. I don't mean to be harsh because the chassis isn't awful, but it does have more of a look of Fisher Price or Leapfrog than Apple or PC. The Screen: The screen on this laptop is dimmer and more grainy (of that makes sense) than my other two laptops (both my other Chromebook and a PC laptop). The screen is anti-glare to be sure (a good thing), but you can sort of see a matrix pattern on the screen (a bad thing). The colors are also ever-so-slightly more washed out and dull. I compared all the screens side-by-side. If you're a student or a parent buying this for a child in grade-school, I don't think you'll be disappointed. If you're a photographer, visual artist, or someone who with a keen eye who enjoys HD movies, you'll notice that this screen is simply not up to par with other laptops on the market. The Keys: The keys on this laptop are my biggest frustration. While many keyboards today are back-lit, that would be a luxury on a Chromebook. Fair enough. But is it too much to ask for high-contrast silk screening? Maybe a phosphorescent or white print color for the keys? Apparently so. This keyboard has mid-to-dark-blue lettering on black keys. A really, really stupid choice that makes no scientific or practical sense other than to match the color blue to the \"ruggedized\" cover trim. These keys will be hard to see in low-lighting. Lastly, the keys on this keyboard are noticeably taller than on my other Asus Chromebook. Probably twice as tall. You feel like you're typing on a manual typewriter. Very poor design choice. Summary: If I were a parent, I'd buy my kid this laptop in a heartbeat. It's compact, durable, water-resistant, has excellent battery life, access to the Internet, if used with Google Drive and Google Docs all work is saved and backed-up automatically, the laptop is somewhat immune to viruses, and it's certainly rugged. However, if I were a college student and wanted all the above *plus* the ability to really enjoy streaming movies and to comfortably type-up term papers for hours on end, I'd probably get a Chromebook with a nicer screen and better keyboard. Sadly, for me, this laptop was a no-go and I'll be returning it. Sticking with the aluminum Asus 2-in-1 with touchscreen. If you found this review, please give me a thumbs up.

I am a writer and I needed something simple without a lot of bells and whistles and whips and chains :)  This little Chromebook netbook is awesome for traveling.  It takes a little bit to get used to Chrome's operating system, but once you do you'll discover some very nice proprietary advantages. A small\u2014but nice thing\u2014is not having to right click any more; instead, you simply tap with two fingers for word corrections.  This is great for someone like me who writes a lot and needs to have a simplified workflow. The battery is long lasting and the keyboard is a perfect size, even for someone as big as I am. 6'3\" 300. Because I use google docs to write with, this seemed a natural step. Chromebook seamlessly integrates Google Docs, and most other important apps into the framework of the little machine, so it's very easy to use and get started. The offline stuff is very useful too as I'm not always in a place where there's wifi and I can still work on my books. Another nice feature is how light it is.  My wife bought a laptop a couple years ago and she would share it with me (begrudgingly) and I always hated working on it because it was big, heavy, and clunky.  This little Chromebook weighs next to nothing and is easy to tote around. All in all, I'd give this 10 stars if I could\u2014especially considering the price.

Of course it's limited in many, many ways, but that's the whole point of buying a Chromebook. I've been using this device for a little over half a semester in college for in class note taking, group work, etc. I use my desktop for any heavy duty stuff. It's worth noting that I rollerblade to classes, so I was looking for something as light as possible and as durable as possible. Pros: Very sturdy - I've dropped it many times and the worst that has happened is the rubber edging will have to be popped back into place. Simple as that and it feels totally firm and solid once it's back in place. It's great to not have to treat your laptop like the slightest bump could damage it. Fantastic keyboard - The keyboard has a nice \"chunk\" with each keystroke. The keys have enough travel and require enough force to avoid accidental keystrokes and typing feels great, even satisfying. Great battery life - I never bring my charger with me anymore, no matter how long I expect to be out. Good sunlight readability -  The screen does a pretty fine job of reducing strong glare. Cons: Weight - Though it's not particularly heavy for a Chromebook, its weight is a significant addition to my backpack. At just over two pounds, however, it's not a huge compromise in return for how durable this machine is. Sometime slow - As you'd expect. But honestly Chrome does a good enough job of managing resources that I only notice severe lag when opening presentations with many elements in them. All in all, this Chromebook has exceeded my expectations!"}, {"name": "Amazon Customer", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2017", "title": "In-Depth Review Sep 2017 - Great Product That Over-delivers", "review_text": "Great Chromebook! Bought as a replacement for my Lenovo Ideapad 310, AMD A12, 8GB Ram. The main reason for the replacement was battery life. Only getting 2-3 hours on the Lenovo, I needed something that could handle my digital nomad lifestyle. PROS: Battery Life - You can easily get 8-9 hours with moderate usage. Performance - I was a tad bit concerned with this factor, but with: ----- 21 tabs open ----- Keypress Editior (coding app from Chrome Store) ----- Webserver for Chome (running a local server for web dev, from Chrome Store) ----- Box SVG (creating & editing vector graphics app from Chrome Store) ----- Polarr (a really good image editior from Chrome Store) ----- Enjoy Music Player (another Chrome Store app) I haven't experienced any significant slow downs. Opening large SVG files or any other larger file, slows the system for a second or two (acceptable). Keyboard - I love typing on this keyboard. Even though it's smaller than my Lenovo, I type faster. Keys are well spaced and feel good to press. Also the key font size is a small aesthetic that you'll appreciate. Build Quality - I won't lie, it's ugly, but it feels very solid in hand. I'm not moving it around like it's a new born baby, as I was with my Lenovo. I can quickly take it out my backpack and slap it on a desk. All the ports feel strong and sturdy. My flash drive does not wiggle while inserted. Screen - It's good for the price, nice matte finish. I haven't had the urge to go back to my Lenovo (15.6) to watch a video or movie. It gets bright and dim to my satisfaction, nuff said. Charge Time - A fast charging device wasn't on my feature list, but this baby is fully charged from 35% in less than 1 hour. Better than my lenovo...I'll take it. Trackpad - It does what I expect and is perfectly placed. My only gripe is how loud actual clicks are, everyone at Starbucks will know when you double-click. Chrome OS - FYI, I'm coming from Ubuntu Desktop. From a bird's eye view Chrome OS may seem limited, but once you dig around the Chrome Store, you'll start finding apps for all your problems and fairly decent app replacements. Furthermore, there are a plethora of web apps outside the Chrome Store to compensate most people's unique necessities. Chrome OS + Google Play - In my opinion these two paired eliminate the \"OS Limits\". If you ever used Android, then you'll know there's an app for everything. I personally haven't even needed the Play Store yet, so I actually disabled it. Storage - I thought this would be an issue, but Google Drive is integrated very well. You get 120GB free for 2 years. You can also expand your local memory with SD card or flash drive. I always keep a flash drive backup. Speakers - As you can tell, I'm not super picky. These speakers get the job done, better than my Lenovo. I don't find myself plugging in my headphones to hear things better as I do with my phone and laptop. They get loud enough for me. Wifi - This was another huge issue I had with my Lenovo, mainly because I was using linux. Asus definitely delivers, connections are always strong and never drop. I'm using this Chromebook in the same locations as I did with the Lenovo. Bluetooth - I couldn't get it to connect with my phone. The pair would instantly drop. I haven't looked for a solution. I sure a bluetooth mouse or headset will work. It's well documented that not all phones pair with Chromebooks. Weight & Portability - It's nice and small, easy to carry around in hand as well as light on the back. Has a great rubber strip on bottom, that not only holds grip on tables and laps better than any other laptop I've owned, but allows it to be carried around like a spiraled notebook. Love Factor - It may be ugly, but I just love using it. It can do more than my phone and suitably replaces my laptop. Easy to carry around, not fragile, well built. It's the perfect piece of technology to augment yourself.

Setup is super easy and it runs incredibly fast. Many other computers take at least 2-3 minutes before I can do anything with them, but not this one! I can immediately get online and access documents without waiting or getting frustrated. The speakers are pretty good for the size of the computer, nothing super loud or anything, but definitely good and clear sound. The keyboard's letters are a light blue color and bigger than most other's. That does not make a very big difference to me, but it would help someone just learning how to use a keyboard or whose vision is not too great. I personally am not a huge fan of the touch pad because most of the time it is difficult or impossible to left click anything, but that was easily solvable by using a small, portable wireless mouse. It does effortlessly keep track of social media notifications, especially Facebook, which is a good but not overall necessary feature, at least for me. It has a good design and definitely would hold up to short distance drops or a little bit of water. I often take this to school and at times it sits in my hot car, but it always manages to work great when in use. My favorite feature of this computer? The battery life. Hands down, the battery life on its own is unbeatable. It lasts at the very least ten hours and I can get anywhere from 3-5 days use on one charge.

It's fast, easy to use, light weight, and durable. The last two qualities are especially important to me because I'm a cyclist and a strap hanger. If you travel primarily by automobile, you can't fully grok how important it is for someone who travels primarily by bicycle and/or bus to pack light and have durable, water resistant gear. It isn't mentioned in the product description, but I was pleasantly surprised that this Chromebook came with a 12 month accident protection warranty. To me that says a lot about Asus' confidence in the durability of their product. Admittedly, I am a big time Google user. I've had a gmail account for years and I use all the wonderful products - Drive (docs, sheets, slides, and drawings), Voice (both phone and sms), Hangouts, Keep, Calendar, etc - that google has. If you're like me in this you'll be very happy to see that this Chromebook is a natural extension of your blissful Google experience. One thing I would strongly recommend to anyone who decides to purchase this product is that you explore the help (?) section soon after you start it up for the first time. This is a Chrome OS so its slightly different than a Mac or Windows OS and will take a little getting used to. It's very intuitive and user friendly but you'll save yourself a lot of frustration if you take an hour to learn how to use it. All in all, I think this is an extraordinary product and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive, very portable computer for school or work. In fact, we liked it so much, we bought a second one for my wife. :-)"}, {"name": "Ben O'Brien", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2018", "title": "Fast, durable and affordable", "review_text": "Speed is fast.

It's a great compact size, is fast as lightning, runs Android apps (after switching the OS to the Beta channel) flawlessly, and works well with USB drives, memory cards, Bluetooth devices, and more. The lightweight footprint of the operating system is a plus because it boots and computes faster than most Windows laptops. The design of the device is rugged and feels very well made.

Sometimes it doesn't work perfectly, you need to log back into your account. Sometimes you try logging in and it doesn't work for some reason.

Then you finally get logged into Google Docs, you start writing your document and have a bad Internet connection for whatever reason.

I went to Staples and saw a Chromebook and was very skeptical.  In the store, I was able to access the website that I needed to work from.... Unfortunately, the Sales Person at Staples was 1) too lazy to see if the particular model that I was using in the store was available and 2) Actually told me that I would not be happy with this purchase and would likely return it and suggested that I shouldn't buy it... So.. I didn't. Instead, I borrowed a typical Laptop form someone and completed my work. I was still intrigued by the chrombook idea... So, I got on Amazon and found this little guy.. I figured that the water resistance on the keyboard might be helpful one day with the machine being primarily for the boat.  I also liked the rugged rubber on the outside.. I was concerned at first about the notion that this was a Student Machine... But... In reality, students are probably WAY ahead of me in computers at this point.

I have been able to access all spreadsheets that are emailed to me and open every business email or program.

I finally settled on this Chromebook, and man I'm glad I did. I was skeptical after reading all the reviews but I'm skeptical about everything these days. So in some of the reviews I saw complaints about screen quality, a cap lock button not working etc. Well, it's a Chromebook so it does not have a cap lock button, so that's a non issue. The screen quality doesn't compare to my iMac, but I wasn't expecting it to, my iMac cost me $1,300 and this Chromebook cost me $216. The screen quality I think is amazing for the price. It's not bad at all. It's not like playing an Atari or the old Sega genesis we had as kids lol. All in all I bought 3 of these Chromebooks and I think they are a great buy! They are very speedy for my slow internet connection and everything functions flawlessly and did I mention they are really easy to set up and operate!? This is just what I needed for the kids. Now I can stay organized with all of my kids school work, no fighting over my expensive desktop and the kids have everything they need in a compact Chromebook. I couldn't be happier with my purchase! They are plenty rugged (mind you they are still a delicate electronic device, I don't care how rugged anyone claims an electronic device to be, my children are going to be taught to treat then very delicately!).

Of course Chromebooks are fast and easy to set up. That is probably standard across the board no matter what brand you choose. What I like about this Asus Chromebook over some of the other Chromebooks I've worked on is the keyboard. It's keys are raised and not as flat. I prefer that for better typing as my own personal preference. I like the look and feel of this Chromebook. It's light weight and not bulky. The screen quality is nice. Someone in another review of this Chromebook commented that the blue lettering was hard to see on black keys. I have not had any issue with it. The blue is a baby blue which stands out fine on the keys, so not a dark blue on black. And my eyes aren't perfect, so I don't feel this is an issue at all. The touch mouse-pad is great.

I bought this pint sized device less than 6 months ago and it's already acting up. The random black outs mid task are driving me up a wall (although it takes less than a minute or two to reboot itself) no one should have to deal with that. Also, sometimes it will freeze if I'm watching a video followed by the loading circle \"not responding\" icon, that's fun too. I'm not one of those Internet users with tons of tabs or apps open 24/7 so I don't understand the crashes. There isn't a designated caps lock button, it is replaced with a search button instead... something that I personally do not care to ever use! On the bright side, it can be tweaked into being a caps lock button in the settings thankfully. (Random: there is no number keys on the right side either, just your designated numbers on the top row of the keyboard, it's compact so that's understandable...) If you're used to using a larger laptop, you will fall into the habit of hitting the screen lock/power button instead of the backspace button.... Slow blink. You'll eventually get used to it though. It's a notebook, so dont assume that you can download anything (software etc) or use this bad boy for music storage and photo albums because you cant. Well you can, but you won't be able to open it obviously. It's not readable.  For an example, If you transferred a music album from your phone to this note book, you will not be able to open the file. It's not a real con, it's just a heads up.

So clearly there is a problem with the chromebook or the charger. I called ASUS warranty support.

So, she suggested that I go and buy a new charger and see if that fixes it.  She had no suggestion of where to go to find one or how I should make sure I got the right one, but just that I buy a charger and try it.  Really not helpful. So I asked what else we could do.  She suggested that I send it in.  Fine.  So now we are sending the notebook in, It will take 7-10 business days - so 2 or three weeks considering the upcoming holidays plus shipping time.  So we will now be out of use of this notebook which we really need for a month. She did offer me expedited return shipping at $30 but that's not really helpful. She also suggested I back up all my data before I ship it to them. Of course I can't power the thing on. So I asked her how I should go about doing that.  She suggested I take it to a local repair person to back up the data and that this person would be able to power it on and pull the data off.  No suggestions of where to go for that but apparently there is someone out there near me who can do this.  I guess.

So far I really enjoy this laptop and use it every day. I  rarely used my old  hp laptop because it was heavy and ran slow until I decided to factory reset it but saw a \"refresh laptop\" option instead and installed another 4gb ram (8gb ram total). I was skeptical about this chromebook because it's only 4gb ram and hardly has memory but everything gets saved to your Google drive. I did a little bit of research when I was laptop shopping and read that chromebooks don't need a lot of ram to run faster because they have an  SSD instead of the old HHD. So I narrowed my search down to a Windows PC with 8gb ram and an SSD or a chromebook! A good windows PC with those specs would've cost me $500+. I started my laptop search without knowing ANYTHING about computer specs and what they meant but you can go on YouTube or Google and find out what's best for you. This laptop definitely isn't for everyone but I've been able to use it for all my needs. It isn't like a Mac or Windows pc where you can download programs and add them to your desktop but you can download apps from the Google play store like you would on a phone or tablet. I would definitely recommend this chromebook for people who just want to browse the internet, watch videos, download apps in the play store, and people who are scared of getting viruses. I read that it's much harder to get a virus on a chromebook than on a Windows PC. This is perfect for kids or people who are likely to catch viruses. I like that it's rugged, doesn't weigh much, is water resistant and stays powered on for hours without a charger. The only thing I can complain about is that not all my HDMI cables work on this.

Totally random failure Rock solid little guy, of course google-chrome is terrible, but I always ran crouton(linux), but now that fails post nov-2018, so I'm using the new google supported 'linux' its ok, but very limited in memory/storage, as the google virtual box, doesn't let you use the external devices, which means your linux is limited to a total of about 8gb for all sys&apps, which ain't much if your running R&PYTHON and doing light development. Great little laptop, much better than ACER ( in terms of reliability ), but now I'm seeing that the infant mortality ain't forever, that 2+ years these little guys start failing. In terms of pure chrome, I think these are great for newbies who just want to shop & do social networking on a laptop, also great support for cameras and such built-in, of course its all SPY-WARE by default, so if your running in Google Mode, you must turn off all the default stuff that listens, watches, records everything you do, including phone, sms, email, sound, video, ... body-motion ( if your on a laptop) moderns 9-axis gravity chips can certainly monitor respiration, so in theory could know your excitability :) Great price, around $100  for a great little Laptop, certainly ONLY huge problem is lack of support for BIG devices, I was running a short 128GB USB thumb drive, but it literally burned up when used for crouton on these little laptops, not enough cooling, the SD-CARDS seem to run much more cool. But now that crouton doesn't work well with the newer version of chrome, your stuck with the new google version of linux, but for the virtual box doesn't support anything outside of a tiny virtual space allocated out of the 16gb total memory, remember if you move up to say 64/128gb chromebooks your talking almost $1,000, so its clear that this C202 is an entry, and the PAIN threshold is to get you to move to APPLE PRICING.

I have not tested out the water resistance yet, but it seems less likely to break when I inevitably drop it, mostly because it is very plastic-y.  Like another reviewer mentioned, it almost seems like a toy computer. It is about twice the thickness of my previous computer and there is a ridge on the base that I guess is supposed to help you grip it? I haven't found that particularly useful, but it does put the keyboard at a slight angle, which I like. Speaking of the keyboard, the keys are raised and the labels are bright blue (another reason it looks like a toy), which makes it easier to type on than most laptops I've used, but there is a noticeable clicking sound when typing. The trackpad also makes a clicking sound, and doesn't seem as sensitive as my other computer, two-finger (right) clicking is particularly difficult. My main complaint is the screen brightness, or lack thereof. It looks like an old desktop monitor, kind of dull and almost pixelated. It does boot up fast, and the battery life is amazing, right now I've been using it for over an hour with 10 tabs open, and the battery is still at 99%.

It booted right up and took off as I had hoped. There are 10 small Phillips screws on the bottom 8 you can see and 2 behind a thin plastic film. About that many hold the battery in. The whole keyboard pops off the base and there are two small ribbon cables attaching it. These cables are released by flipping up little \"doors\" on the receptacles and then the cable lifts out. There is a flat metal heat sink that goes over the battery held on by 4 screws. A 3rd ribbon cable crosses over the battery and plugs in to a circuit board using the same flip door receptacle as the other two. The battery has its own small plug that plugs into the circuit board.

I've always had good vision, but I had to buy reading glasses so that I could see the keys and I purchased stick-on labels with white lettering that make the keyboard more user-friendly for an older person.   I am a student and I found out that I cannot view MS Word files on this Chromebook. My instructors send Word files that I cannot open, so now, I have to use my old laptop for schoolwork. I use this Chromebook only for social media, as I cannot submit anything with Wordpad.   The third pain is the scroll bar on the right side - it keeps disappearing. I was able to modify the scroll bar so that it is easier to use, but it is still a major hassle. The arrow keys only work some of the time, sometimes switching the volume up and down instead. You need to stop what you're doing and use both hands to scroll down the page. Major inconvenience if you are holding something in your right hand.   Come New Year's Eve, I purchased a virus software because of the warning about Iranian hackers. When I tried to download the anti-virus program, but I was unable to because Chromebook doesn't use Windows. The software I bought was useless.   A fourth issue I am having is that I'm used to having a right-click button. If I want to copy/paste an image, I have to double-tap the keyboard or use Cntrl +C and my other hand again. I have bought a wireless mouse to make the double-click an easier process, but I'm disappointed that the manufacturer decided to omit this important feature.   The fifth problem is finding the date - I have to click on the bottom right corner and fetch my reading glasses to read the date - it's in the tiniest of letters.   The sixth problem is that I'm sick and tired of having to use my Google password to log in. If I go away for a few minutes, the screen turns black and I have to log in once again. I changed the procedure to just 7 numbers but its still a major waste of time, especially since I have to use two computers while doing homework, and the screen turns black all the time.

It does everything I need it to do and since it runs off google I can jump from my iphone to the chrome book through the google drive to move files, so if I dont have my computer I can pull it up on my phone on the go. The color quality of the screen is NO mac or windows but it serves its purpose. the volume isnt very loud but its enough. I mostly do things dealing with the google office features, browse the web and and watch youtube or netflix. I wouldnt recommend to add a million apps to it with the limited internal storage. It also did work for a period with my cloud printer and recently stopped so to get around it I would have to save whatever I want to print on my google drive and then access it through my phone to print.

There are a lot of complaints that Chromebooks are useless without an internet connection - it's total malarky.

It feels great to hold and use. The only thing I would say holds the laptop back is the chromeOS. If this came with no OS or something like Linux Mint or Ubuntu it would be absolutely perfect. But the chromeOS makes doing a lot of things a hassle. Its possible to replace the OS but its a really big pain and probably not something the majority of users would be able to do comfortably. The only good thing about the chromeOS that I liked was how quickly it turns back on. But thats only because the laptop never really fully turns off. It just goes into a sort of sleep/standby mode. With that said I'd hate to give this laptop anything less than a 5/5 because the laptop itself is really high quality and even though the chromeOS isn't the best it still is doing the job I needed it for. Pros Light and portable. Quick to turn on. (Because it never fully turns off) Great for just browsing the internet or watching/streaming video. Has a great look and feel to it. Good build quality. Fairly easy to take apart. The mouse takes a little getting used to but once you do get used to it its a very good mouse. Cons Pretty much all of the cons are to do with the chromeOS Poor compatibility with software. (You are limited mostly to google playstore apps unless you want to really work hard to install things.) Computer never fully turns off. (Both a pro and a con) Have to take the computer apart and void the warranty just to get full control of the device. Very small amount of storage space. (I ended up buying a small low profile flashdrive and use that for storage) If you are just going to use this as a laptop to browse the internet on or maybe do some banking on its the perfect laptop. If you had other plans I'd highly recommend getting a laptop that has windows installed even if you want to later install a linux OS its far easier to do that from windows than it would be from chromeOS."}, {"name": "Gwen", "rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2020", "title": "not great", "review_text": "I probably didn't look at the specs hard enough before ordering this, but I was seriously disappointed, and am returning it. The screen on it is small, which was, fine? I guess, but the ability to adjust it was lacking so everything was really blue. The video quality wasn't great, which, given the pandemic and the need to hold video conferences etc.. was a huge problem. When I ran Zoom I got an error message that my CPU usage was too high, and therefore it would cause Zoom call quality to be low. This was a HUGE problem because I need to have Zoom working for both work and personal life. I can't just switch platforms for video calls, because I don't control which ones are used. This laptop seems to want to market itself to students who are doing school online, but from what I understand, a lot of people are doing online school with said video elements, even pre-pandemic.

Being from Google, it will use your Google username and password, so if you don't have a Google account set up at the time you order, I would suggest you set one up. Software runs very fast, files load just as fast, and saving happens in the blink of an eye.

Cons: My biggest pet peeve with laptop companies is the fact that they ALWAYS F-up the thermal paste so the thing is bouncing off 98c. This laptop was a bit different after a day of lots of creation, 2 cores hit around 89-90 but stayed around 65-75 degrees. For an ultra book thats not bad.

Oh well, I cleaned that up on day 1. - On the first day I noticed the touchpad has \"give\" on the front edge (towards the user) and it actually rises slightly above the surface, enough to scrape on skin. Anyway, I thought, lets ignore this and move on. - In a few weeks, I noticed a dead pixel on the screen. Now I can't help but notice it all the time. Perfect. - The fingerprint sensor works 50% of the time. Wiping finger and sensor doesn't help when it doesn't work. - [maybe not a laptop issue] I use a bluetooth mouse and sometimes the mouse pointer just goes crazy and wants to go to the lower right corner. If all these things worked like on paper, this would be a laptop I would be recommending to *everyone* but as they say, in business, execution is key. Or they're giving a price cut by using cut-rate parts, like the display - which is gorgeous, except with a dead pixel. Who knows. All you need to know is you're tossing a coin on this one.

Keyboard - Huge problem here.  The added row of keys on the right side shifts the entire keyboard to the left.  I don't know why other reviews don't harp on this.  It not ergonomic at all, and all your years of muscle memory with a QWERTY keyboard will be wasted.  I used it for a week, did several typing tests, and consistently had problems with this layout.

I was coming from a Macbook, which uses a glass touchpad.  This touchpad has a lot of texture, so it is very difficult to make smooth movements on it.  In fact, this ended up being the most annoying problem and the one I could've live with.  Perhaps if you are coming from another PC with a rough touchpad you wouldn't notice.

Though the resolution is good, the colors are definitely average and so is the contrast (at least when comparing to my old Retina Macbook). I'm sure to the average user this wouldn't be noticeable. As for the touchscreen, I don't really care for touchscreen computers so I will probably never use that feature. The fingerprint reader is a nice feature, it saves me from having to type in my password on the lockscreen. For battery, I probably get like 3-4 hours of normal usage on the \"better battery\" power mode. \"power saving\" mode is far to slow to make it usable, especially if you are multitasking."}, {"name": "Koustubh", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2019", "title": "Laptop not booting", "review_text": "After 10 days only, laptop is not starting.

I pored over reviews, technical data, and other analysis but decided on the HP because it was just too much premium and value to disqualify. This particular version is packed with tech that would cost over $2,000 in a similarly equipped Surface Laptop 2, yet I paid just $1000 on Prime Day. Even at $1299 it's a steal, considering you're getting a full 4k display, 512gb SSD and 16gb RAM. The fingerprint reader and backlit keyboard are bonuses, as is the premium build of the hardware. It may not quite edge out the Microsoft fit and finish but it's awfully close. I came from a Yoga 910 which was a gorgeous laptop with similar specs, but I couldn't stand the keyboard. It was prone to missing my keystrokes, and it was loud, with shallow key travel. The Envy's keyboard proved a far better suitor after testing it out at a retail box store, and the rest is history. If you are a writer, appreciate fine design, and want a speedy 8th Gen i7 with more storage and RAM than the average user would ever need, here's your ultrabook. Forget the frills of Bang & Olufsen, which is really just a nicely placed license to evoke an extra premium feel rather than a useful sound upgrade, and enjoy the quality build. Don't expect the fingerprint reader to be 100% accurate (it's not), but appreciate the fact that HP put the front-facing webcam where it's supposed to be and deal with the above-average battery life that underdelivers but still excels.

About a month passed, the problem happened again, this time I had the knowledge to fix it in a much shorter time-span. Now, about a month later, every time my laptop falls asleep, or is turned off, there is an 80% chance that the \"this device failed to start\" error is going to occur and I will be stuck in airplane mode. Restarting works about 10% of the time, disabling the device and re-enabling works about 5% of the time, shutting it down and turning it back on works about 20% of the time, the other 65% of the time, none of it works and I just have to start trying random combinations to get it back online.

I use this for work and it is unbelievably annoying when I can't check my work email because I am constantly restarting my computer to try and get it back online, or disabling and re-enabling the wireless module only for the wireless device to say the same error message. tl:dr - Great laptop minus the built in wireless adapter. If you do buy it for all the good features, immediately buy a usb wireless adapter to avoid dealing with the headache I've experienced before this 1000 dollar plus laptop forces you to buy one to avoid the constant and consistent failure of the built in wireless adapter.

Battery life is bad. I can only get 3 to 4 hours per charge. You can dim the brightness and lower the resolution to extend it but I don't and you probably won't either. 2.

I play a lot of old games (2000's-2012ish). They run smoothly and fine, but the laptop overheats EXTREMELY easy. This is on games not running on the native 4k display. I've had to use a laptop cooler to play any games. Even Runescape, a game from freaking 2003 makes this laptop hot.  I do love the 4k display though, it looks extremely clear. The fingerprint ID sensor works fine for the most part. Every now and then it will be unresponsive. Battery life is about 4-5 hours max. Overall, a good laptop but it has it's flaws.

I do love this computer.  The feel and look is impressive from the start.  HP even ships it in a very nice box.  I have several other HP computers and they came in plain cardboard.  The box this one comes in makes it look like a present.  Okay, trivial, I know, but a nice touch. The computer is an Intel Core i7, so you know it is going to be fast and powerful.  I won\u2019t go into all the other specs, you can see them yourself on the description.  The keyboard feels great.  The screen is very clear and beautiful with terrific resolution and vibrant colors. The sound, with the Bang & Olufsen speakers, is excellent for a laptop. Oh, my gosh, I love logging in with my fingerprint. This computer obviously has the business traveler in mind.  The body is metal, not plastic, and the screen is Corning Gorilla glass.  You can see and feel the difference.  It should be much more sturdy than a typical cheap laptop.  I should mention it has a touchscreen. Now, keep in mind that the metal and glass weigh more than plastic.  This 13\u201d computer is heavier than my 15-inch HP.  It also does run warm.  However, the lid, when opened, lifts the bottom of the laptop off of a desk just a bit, which should help.  I can hear the fan, as well, which some people may find annoying.  I don't, as I always have music or TV running. Setup was incredibly fast and easy, with Cortana guiding the way.

Sexy. MAGNIFIQUE!", "review_text": "These are probably the last words that come to mind when thinking of a laptop, but this Ultrabook earns its name and then some in every way, because anyone who sees you using this will be BESIDE themselves, and I mean SICK, with Envy. This thang is FIYAH!!!!!!!!!! Let's start with the unboxing: it arrives in a sleek, black box with a beautiful photo of the laptop on its cover, and when you open it, you are awed by the pristine, silver gleaming contraption inside. When you pick it up and gently unwrap it from its plastic film, you are wowed by how both light and elegant it is in your hands; how something so small can contain your life, and then you can't wait to start filling it up with it. You open the lid and lift the mesh cover protecting the keys; you notice the setup leaflet and take out the power cord, plug her in and turn her on. From there, Cortana takes over, guiding you through the setup! By voice command! Very Jason Bourne. You set up your fingerprint log in, sign in to your accounts and then once everything is registered, off into the wild wild web you go. The first thing you'll notice is how FAST this baby is, the gentle whir of the machine as she takes you off to the farthest reaches of the world if you check out the 4K resolution by looking at the Planet Earth series. It's enough to bring tears to your eyes. You'll be mesmerized by the rhythmic clicking of the keys as you go to your favorite websites and download/install your must-have apps and programs; you will find yourself looking down at the keyboard and smiling as if you've been enchanted by a new lover, and you HAVE! I had been looking for a new computer because I've got this ollllld slooooooooow, 4GB RAM dinosaur of an 15\" laptop that I bought used in a dire emergency because I accidentally cracked the screen on my Toshiba. The \"Gorilla glass\" on this is so beautiful that I don't even want to TOUCH it, even though the touch screen is flawless, like you are on a tablet. The keyboard is perfectly sized and responsive; there is just so much here for me to continue to explore but I am damn near breathless as I write this review because it is simply that exceptional, stunning. I have had some graphic design programs that I wanted to use but was waiting until I got something new so it would have the capacity to rock out, and I can't wait to get started. Where this HAS been incredible for me is Traktor and music programs. No more worrying about lag and staticky mixing because of system overload. This has all the memory and SSD space that you will need, and its ports will more than accommodate any other gadgets you need to connect to it. The sound is exemplary, with the Bang & Olufsen speakers. This is the Ultrabook that every entrepreneur or very lucky student should have; it is the answer and perhaps even a juggernaut to the Macbook. I've certainly learned that just one POWERFUL Ultrabook is WORTH the investment rather than having to replace a tired ass notebook every few years. I prefer large screens so 13 inches has never appealed to me, but this right here has ROCKED. MY. WORLD. I don't wanna go anywhere without it, not even the shower. LOL You have just got to see for yourself."}, {"name": "Bob W", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2019", "title": "Almost perfect", "review_text": "UPDATE: I've been using this laptop for a while now. I've raised my review from four stars to five. It's true, the touchpad is quirky, but I use the computer with a Bluetooth mouse. The reason I've upgraded my review is that even compared to my MacBook Pro, the HP envy stands out. We've recently moved and I spent the last three weeks using this laptop instead of my normal desktop computer. The more I work with it, the happier I am. I've read reviews to complain about the Wi-Fi connectivity. I had absolutely no difficulty. For a while, I was using the personal hotspot on my iPhone. The laptop flawlessly connected and stay connected for days. Speed is incredible! I've been using Photoshop and variance absolutely no delays even when doing complex editing. I admit that I don't use the touchscreen much. I'm just not used to that idea. But when I do, it's accurate and fun. This laptop seems to be HP's attempt at directly competing with the 13 inch MacBook Pro. It certainly looks like one. It's very light; under 3 pounds. It has a powerful four-core Intel processor (Please note that the description of this product says it has a dual core processor. That's not correct mine has a four core.). The screen is great. It has adequate brightness to use in daylight. The colors are vivid and accurate. The touchscreen is every bit as good as any I have ever tried. I have to admit that I usually forget the touchscreen is present; I'm so used to doing everything on a keyboard. However, when I realize I can use my finger, the results are great. This laptop has 16 GB of memory. That's more than enough to run Photoshop and edit large images. I've also run Premier Pro with no problems at all. The combination of the powerful processor and fast, plentiful memory makes this machine perfect for a power user like me. This laptop could easily replace my desktop computer in terms of processing, memory and disk size. My unit has 512 GB of SSD. Considering that most of my data lives in the cloud, I'm never going to run out of disk space. The touchpad is the one weak spot in this nearly-perfect laptop. I find it not nearly as responsive as my Mac's. It's very fussy about where you press it to get a left click or a right-click. The Mac works with just a tap with one finger for left click and two for a right-click. That doesn't happen with the HP. I use a Microsoft mobile mouse to compensate. That brings me to one really great feature of Windows 10. If you go to the Control Panel and then the mouse screen, you'll find that there is an option to disconnect the touchpad when the mouse is present. This is an amazingly important feature. In the past, I've disabled the touchscreen to prevent accidental mouse activity while typing. Then, on occasion I had a problem at startup and needed to use the touchscreen. Of course it didn't work. Now, if I connect my mouse (Bluetooth), the touchpad is disabled. If I want to do something quickly in the car, and there is no mouse, the touchpad works. The keyboard is generously sized and the keys have a nice solid feel. I have one little quibble: in bright light I find it difficult to read the white markings on the silver keys. In a normally lit room the keys are backlit and very easy to read. I've used HP laptops in the past. I think the keyboard in this laptop is a real step forward for them. Priced similarly to the MacBook Pro, I expected a great deal from this laptop. From the perspective of processing power and useful features, this HP competes favorably. If anything, the screen is better. Colors are accurately rendered, brightness is more than adequate, and the touch functionality is a great bonus. Battery life is excellent. I don't have the standard test suite to verify the manufacturers claim of about eight hours of working on a charge. I can say that I had absolutely no problem getting through the day without needing to recharge. Of course, battery life is dependent on how you are using the laptop. For example, when I worked with it in my car I had to crank up screen brightness which of course, eats up battery. Even so, I never ran out of power. Wi-Fi operation is flawless. The built-in camera and microphone provide excellent quality for videoconferencing and other AV needs. I like that there is a physical switch to turn off the internal camera. That certainly improved my comfort using the device in my hotel room. If HP could fix their quirky touchpad, this could be a true MacBook killer. Even with the less-than-perfect touchpad, it's a joy working with this computer."}]}
